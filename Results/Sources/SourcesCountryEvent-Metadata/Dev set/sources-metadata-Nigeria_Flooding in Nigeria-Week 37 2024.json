        "content": "title: 'No dam collapsed,' FG explains Maiduguri flood \n content: The Federal Government has explained the cause of the Maiduguri flood disaster, stressing that no dam broke as initially speculated.\nAccording to the government, the recent devastating Maiduguri flood was caused by the overflow of the Ngadda River, and not collapse of the Alau Dam .\nThe Minister of Water Resources and Sanitation, Engineer Joseph Utsev, made the clarification at a briefing in Abuja on Friday.\nAccording to the minister, the Alau Dam, located in Maiduguri, Borno State, remained intact.\nThe minister said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t actually envisage that the water level this year will be of this magnitude.\n\u201cBecause of climate change, the downpour was in excess, and the rivers could not actually contain the water.\n\u201cSo, more water than was unexpected spilled into Alau Dam, and spilled over the dyke.\n\u201cAlau Dam did not collapse. It was one of the dykes that could not hold excess water coming from the tributaries; so it overflowed the dam.\n\u201cSo, this flood disaster that affected Maiduguri and Jere areas of Borno State was largely due to overflow of water from Alau Dam, which is about 10 kilometers from Maiduguri city centre, owing to massive inflow from Ngadda river, a major tributary of River Yedzaram.\u201d\nLooming flood disaster\nMeanwhile, besides the Maiduguri flood, the minister warned that there is going to be serious flooding in the Niger Delta region and other southern states.\nHence, the government and people should activate emergency measures to mitigate the impact.\n\u201cAs we mourn the losses in Borno, Yobe, Jigawa, Bauchi and other states affected by flooding, the attention of Nigerians is hereby drawn to the probable flooding on rivers Niger and Benue and some of their tributaries.\n\u201cThe daily flow on these rivers indicates significant increase in flow levels tending towards red alert.\n\u201cThis warning means that a large volume of water is moving through our rivers down to the delta region.\n\u201cTherefore, we should increase vigilance on all ramifications and step up proactive measures to address any eventual flooding events in the southern part of the country,\u201d he said.",

WFP's is working to provide hot meals to 50,000 of the worst affected children, women, and men who have lost their homes in what has been described as the worst flooding in northeast Nigeria in 30 years. The devastating floods occurred as a dam near Maiduguri collapsed due to torrential rains, forcing the river water to overrun 50 percent of Maiduguri, the capital city of the Borno State. The State Government has issued evacuation orders to residents in the affected areas, while appealing for humanitarian support.\n\"Maiduguri is facing a crisis within a crisis, with conflict, record food price inflation and now floods displacing hundreds of thousands of people, most of whom were already cut off from their farms,\" said David Stevenson, WFP's Country Director and Representative.\nWFP has established food kitchens in three camps - Teachers' Village, Asheikh, and Yerwa - to provide meals to flood-hit people over the next two weeks. The kitchens provide nutritious cooked rice and beans to affected families. Specialized nutritious foods are also being provided to children, pregnant women and nursing mothers to cover their nutritional needs. However, additional assistance will be critical to restore stability and support recovery.\nWFP swiftly dispatched UN humanitarian air service (UNHAS) helicopters to conduct an interagency aerial assessment of damage in Maiduguri and its surroundings.

The attack was perpetrated by a non-state armed group (NSAG), according to local authorities.\n\nMany other people including women and children were also reportedly injured in the attack.\n\nState Government authorities are verifying the numbers of the dead, injured and missing, with casualties suspected to be higher.\n\nDuring the attack, the NSAGs reportedly also burnt down shelters, businesses and other property, and planted improvised explosive devices along roads leading to Mafa town.\n\nOn behalf of the United Nations in Nigeria, I convey my deepest condolences to the families that lost their loved ones and wish the injured a speedy recovery. The United Nations stands in solidarity with the people and the Government of Yobe State during this difficult time.\n\nI condemn this heinous attack in the strongest terms and remind all parties to the conflict to adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians from harm. The armed actors who perpetrated these attacks must be identified and brought to account \u2013 in compliance with international human rights law \u2013 as a first step towards reining in the impunity that feeds these attacks.\n\nThe deadly attack forced thousands of people to flee from Mafa to Babban Gida, the headquarters of Tarmuwa LGA, and to other neighbouring communities, with some people walking for hours in search of safety.

Year-on-year headline inflation surged to 34.19 percent, while food inflation reached 40.87 percent. These increase in prices disproportionately affect vulnerable households, particularly those already grappling with displacement and limited livelihood opportunities due to the ongoing conflict in the northeast, northwest, and northcentral states.\n-\nWFP is collaborating with government stakeholders to implement the recently launched action plans for durable solutions to internal displacement. In Yobe State, joint effort with the Emergency Management Agency and the Coordinating Office for Durable Solutions led to the development of a shared action plan for implementation. Additionally, a collaborative initiative with the Borno State government aims to revitalize food value chains in stable areas of the state. By aligning strategies and leveraging shared priorities, WFP aims to maximize impact and promote long-term solutions particularly around joint priorities related to fragility, resilience, and livelihoods.\nOperational Updates\n-\nIn June, WFP assisted a total of 830,952 people through nutrition integrated general food distributions with 609,516 people living in areas with functional markets receiving lifesaving food assistance through electronic vouchers redeemable for food commodities from WFP contracted food retailers. Simultaneously, 194,608 vulnerable people received food rations delivered by WFP and its cooperating partners.\n-\nStarting in July, WFP has planned the phased scale up of general food distributions to reach 1.6 million people across the northeast and northwest states by the peak of the lean season in August. The scale up will include over 1.4 million people in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states as well as 186,167 people across Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara states - covering 65 percent of each targeted household's food needs.\n-\nTo enhance livelihoods and improve post-harvest practices, WFP, and its partner, Centre for Community Development and Research Network (CCDRN), have commenced the distribution of agro-processing equipment to 400 beneficiaries across 4 LGAs in Yobe and Jigawa states. Grouped into clusters, the beneficiaries will receive equipment including hammer mills, multi-purpose mobile threshers and de-stoners to boost their productivity and incomes.",

Video footages showed hundreds of houses and vehicles submerged by the flood.\nResidents were seen wading waist-deep along otherwise well-paved major roads. Our correspondent reported that dangerous animals like snakes, crocodiles and others broke loose from the zoo, thus further endangering the already embattled citizens.\nAmong the hardest-hit areas were the Government House, Monday Market, Moromoro, Gwange, State Lowcost Estate, NUJ Press Centre, Lagos Street (one of the city\u2019s main trunk roads), Shehu of Borno\u2019s palace, parts of the University of Maiduguri and others. Cemeteries were also breached, as corpses were seen floating in the flood water.\nPresident Bola Tinubu ordered massive evacuations and gave his commitment to relief efforts. Vice President, Kashim Shettima, quickly rushed home to Maiduguri, to assess the extent of the calamity and be with the people he governed for eight years, in their dark period of need. He was seen wading through the flood as he visited displaced persons and ordered the immediate procurement of 50 trucks of rice. According to the Vice President, it was the worst flood disaster in 30 years.\nIt has claimed the lives of over 30 people, with over 400,000 displaced. The scale of the disaster is expected to continue to rise. Beyond the loss of lives and displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, the victims are faced with shortage of food, water and the imminence of disease outbreaks.\nThis is a national disaster, and it calls for all Nigerians and people of goodwill all over the world to rush to the assistance of the victims in their moment of need. It is sad that almost every state in the deeper North has experienced a measure of massive flooding, loss of lives and destruction of property.\nWe call on the Federal Government to declare Maiduguri a disaster zone and mobilise international support to help people hit by this year\u2019s round of flood disasters. Governments, public-spirited individuals and foundations should act fast. Though we differ in many ways and often make the mistake of allowing ourselves to be divided along those lines, we are still united in humanity. No one is above the power of natural disaster. Whenever disaster strikes, humanity must close ranks to overcome it.\nThis is a clarion call on all states and people who live around dams and along major river banks. The annual weather advisories by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) and its affiliate bodies should be taken more seriously and precautions taken to evade or limit the damage.\nEvery flood-prone state should never be caught unawares.",

Some 800,000 people in 29 states in Nigeria have been affected by floods as of September 2024, WFP said, and over 550,000 hectares of cropland have been flooded.\nAs of March this year, some 32 million people in the country were already facing acute hunger.\nThe UN\u2019s food agency said that it needs $147.9 million to support food insecure people in Nigeria\u2019s northeast over the coming six months.\nFor the flood-affected populations in Maiduguri, \u201crecovery will take long,\u201d Mr. Bigenimana said. \u201cWe need more resources to save lives and to put together efforts to respond to the crises - and also think of longer-term recovery and solutions.\u201d",

For years the law has helped make women and girls safer. But now it is at risk of reversal.\n\u201cRepealing the VAPP Act would not only undermine efforts to protect Nigerian women and girls from violence but also threaten their right to education,\u201d says Nabila Aguele, Malala Fund\u2019s Chief Executive, Nigeria. \u201cWhen girls feel safe, they are more likely to attend school and reach their full potential. We cannot afford to take a step back in the fight for gender equality. We urge the Senate to amend and strengthen the Act, rather than repeal it.\u201d\nLeading the call to repeal the VAPP Act is Senator Jibrin Isah, representing Kogi East district. His repeal bill has passed its second reading in the Senate. He argues that the VAPP act is ambiguous, riddled with legislative errors and is not \u201cholistic\u201d enough. The Senator is also concerned that the Act doesn\u2019t provide adequate compensation to GBV victims. He proposes increasing the fines and imprisonment penalties as a more effective warning to potential offenders.\nMalala Fund is working with its partners in Nigeria, including Invictus Africa and Education as a Vaccine, to urge the Senate to reject the repeal of the VAPP Act. We are instead recommending an amendment that would ensure clear, inclusive language that protects all individuals, particularly women and girls.\n\u201cThe VAPP Act is now adopted by 35 out of 36 states in Nigeria. Let us build on this progress by amending and properly implementing the Act rather than repealing it,\u201d says Bukky Shonibare, the Executive Director of Invictus Africa, in response to the potential repeal.\nAlongside our partners, Malala Fund also calls on the Nigerian government to improve how it implements the VAPP Act to better protect and support GBV survivors.\n\u201cEnacting and implementing legal protection to prevent gender-based violence is critical for ensuring girls have access to education, stay in school and complete their education,\u201d says Toyin Chukwudozie, Executive Director of Education as a Vaccine. \u201cRepealing the VAPP Act will jeopardise this fundamental right for all girls nationwide. It is unnecessary and undermines the efforts of everyone who fought for its passage.\u201d\nMalala Fund and its partners advocate for legislative changes to ensure 12 years of free education for all Nigerian children. Our Education Champions in the country remain committed to creating a safe and supportive environment for girls to learn and thrive. The VAPP Act is a crucial component of this effort, and we will continue to advocate for its preservation and implementation.\nAbout our partners\nWith their Malala Fund grant, Invictus Africa advocates for gender-responsive budgeting that prioritises girls\u2019 education needs in Oyo and Gombe states.\nEducation as a Vaccine\u2019s Malala-Fund supported work focuses on getting girls back in school and dismantling barriers to their education by training girl advocates in Kaduna state.",

We need everyone on board the government, private sector, banks, and people from all walks of life.\n\u201cThe media plays a huge role in publicizing this accurately. It was mentioned yesterday that the campaign in India was successful because people heard about open defecation everywhere in the media, schools, and hospitals.\n\u201cTo achieve the same impact in Nigeria, we need to put it in people\u2019s minds that defecation should only take place in toilets.\u201d\nOn her part, the Coordinator of Clean Nigeria, Chizome Opara, lamented that 48 million Nigerians still practice open defecation, saying immediate action is needed from all stakeholders to arrest the ugly trend,\nAccording to her, this action, if effectively managed could reduce the transmission of NTDs, and engender improved sanitation and hygiene practices.\n\u201cAs we explore strategies for collaboration, share success stories, and discuss challenges in achieving an open defecation-free Nigeria, let\u2019s work together to create a more secure environment for Nigerians,\u201d she urged.\nThe Assistant Director, WASH Track, Ministry of Water Resources, Joseph Adeyemo said: linked open defecation to the spread of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).\n\u201cOpen Defecation, a practice that persists in many parts of our country, with about 48 million persons engaging in the act in Nigeria, is a sanitation and hygiene-related issue and a significant contributor to the spread of NTDs. Diseases like onchocerciasis, Schistosomiasis, Trachoma, Lymphatic Filariasis, Soil Transmitted Helminthiasis(STH) etc. are transmitted through contaminated soil and faeces, perpetuating a cycle of poverty, malnutrition, and ill health.\n\u201cBy addressing Open Defecation, we can significantly reduce the transmission of NTDs, improved sanitation and hygiene practices can break the cycle of infection, protecting vulnerable populations, especially children and women.\n\u201cThrough this dialogue, we aim to raise awareness about the importance of ending Open Defecation and its impact on NTD elimination. We will explore strategies for collaboration, share success stories, and discuss challenges in achieving a Nigeria free from Open Defecation and NTDs\u201d.\nOther high points of the dialogue include a panel discussion, featuring WASH experts from UNICEF, Water Aid, and United States Agency for International Development \u2013 Lagos Urban WASH (USAID-LUWASH), along with a representative from the private sector.\nThe panel gave insights on how various stakeholders could work together on the campaign to end open defecation in Nigeria",

Flooding now covers more than 40% of Maiduguri, a city with an estimated population of over 870,000, including vulnerable populations in the Muna and Jere IDP camps.\nThe immediate needs of those affected include food, shelter, clean water, and essential Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) supplies. Protection remains a significant concern, particularly for women, girls, unaccompanied children, older persons, and people living with disabilities. Non-food items (NFIs) and interventions to prevent waterborne diseases such as cholera in congested IDP sites are urgently required. The flooding has also disrupted operations at nutrition stabilization centers, which treat severely malnourished children in MMC and Jere LGAs, emphasizing the need for continued nutritional support to prevent relapses.\nCARE and partners' response in Nigeria\nCARE Nigeria is mobilizing a response to the flooding, targeting vulnerable populations \u2013 including women and girls. CARE will provide food, water/sanitation services, and other non-food items. Additionally, CARE will work alongside local partners to provide protection and psychosocial support to reduce the risk of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, that often arise in emergency situations.\nFor media inquiries, contact Habeeb Sulaiman, CARE Nigeria Communications Lead, Habeeb.Sulaiman@care.org, or email usa.media@care.org.",

In Maiduguri alone, 37 bodies have been found, reported deaths, 58 persons with severe injuries, 389,267 persons displaced, 7,125 households have been affected in nine local government areas, and 7,337 land families have been washed away, with over 414,000 people utterly affected, wandering in search of shelter, security, and hope.\n\u201cMore than 114,000 internally displaced persons have been directly affected, with many of their shelters affected and critically need to be washed as well as sanitation and hygiene facilities.\n\u201cThese facilities have already been submerged, leaving people without clean water or sanitation. Road and transport networks have been destroyed, making it even harder to deliver much-needed aid.\u201d\nMeanwhile, she disclosed that ActionAid Nigeria is currently on ground working with local governments and international partners to provide immediate relief materials whilst conducting rapid assessments, distributing emergency food supplies, clean water, hygiene kits, and other essential items to affected communities.\nHowever, she also advocated for survival-centred, need-based, and gender-responsive action, adding that distribution of items should be deployed in a respectful manner that reserves and preserves the dignity of people affected and their rights as human beings whilst ensuring accountability in the disbursement of the relief materials.\n\u201cDistribution of items should be deployed in a respectful manner that reserves and preserves the dignity of people affected and their rights as human beings. We must also address the risk of disease outbreaks.\n\u201cAs we know, floods create perfect conditions for the spread of waterborne diseases. Immediate initiatives must be put in place to mitigate these threats. Clean water access, sanitation, and healthcare services are critical.\n\u201cThere is no need diverting anything that is meant for these people at this crucial time. We cannot trample on the rights of displaced persons in the rush to deliver aid.\n\u201cEvery step of this process must respect their humanity. We must also work in full collaboration with credible and community-rooted civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and volunteers to ensure that aid distribution is not only\nefficient but transparent, monitoring and evaluation are crucial,\u201d she added.\nThe humanitarian manager at AAN, David Habba, said the overflow of the Alau Dam was made-made and could have been avoided if proactive actions were taken.\nHabba, who lamented that the disaster has caused lives to be lost and rendered thousands homeless and displaced, accused leaders of failing citizens despite having the resources to prevent the disaster, including the technology, skill, science, and resources to be able to prevent the magnitude of destruction and the loss of lives, adding that the issue of flood in the northeast has become a norm with no solution in sight.",

        "content": "title: Nigeria: Severe Floods in Nigeria Magnify the Dire Humanitarian Crisis \n content: United Nations \u2014 On Monday, the Alau dam in Maiduguri, Borno State, collapsed, causing flash floods to ravage neighbouring regions in Nigeria. This comes after weeks of torrential rain, which caused severe structural damage to the dam. The floods have changed the lives of thousands and caused high levels of damage to infrastructures. The impacts of the recent floods compound with Nigeria's pre-existing humanitarian crisis, which includes armed conflict, widespread malnutrition, and a failing economy.\nAli Ndume, a representative for Borno South, emphasizes the severity of the destruction, saying, \"Homes, institutions, government agencies, and other businesses have been submerged in the flood. Many people are trapped and are trying to evacuate. I'm worried that the situation may get worse unless the Federal Government immediately steps in to assist the state government in salvaging the situation\".\nAccording to reports by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), approximately 40 percent of Maiduguri has been covered by high waters, with over 240,000 people having been affected in total. Water damage has led to the collapse of several critical infrastructures in Nigeria, including bridges, roads, electricity systems, healthcare facilities, and schools.\nThe zonal coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Surajo Garba, informed reporters that approximately 23,000 residences have been submerged underwater.\nThe current death toll from the floods is unknown as authorities struggle to remove people who have been trapped in buildings. Ezekiel Manzo, spokesperson for NEMA, estimates that at least 30 civilians have been killed.\nAli Abatcha Don Best, the general manager of the Sanda Kyarimi Zoo, told reporters that 80 percent of the zoo's animals have been killed by the floods. He adds that several dangerous animals, such as crocodiles and snakes, have been washed into human settlements, urging civilians to stay vigilant.\nAdditionally, high waters have significantly damaged farmlands, approximately 110,000 hectares, according to NEMA. This greatly exacerbates the pre-existing hunger crisis in Nigeria.\n\"Some of the flood-affected areas in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states are facing a food and nutrition crisis impacting 4.8 million people and putting the lives of 230,000 children at risk of acute malnutrition\", stated St\u00e9phane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General, at a United Nations (UN) press briefing on Wednesday.\nThe impact on Nigeria's economy has been substantial. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), agriculture contributes to about 22.35 percent of Nigeria's gross domestic product, employing over 70 percent of all Nigerians.\nThe effects of the floods add on to Nigeria's ongoing hostilities, caused by the Boko Haram insurgency, which has caused about 35,000 casualties and over 2.6 million displacements.\nYobe State, a neighboring district of Borno, has been devastated by severe flooding and a deadly terrorist attack in the span of two weeks. Dungus Abdulkarim, spokesperson for the Yobe Police stated that in early September, approximately 50 extremists rode on motorcycles into Yobe, opening fire on markets and houses before setting them ablaze, claiming at least 100 casualties. Many villagers remain missing.\nReprisals of armed conflict in northeast districts have been rampant. These areas, which have been ravaged by floods, are particularly vulnerable. The police have been spread thin, dealing with an influx of people in need. Protection is a serious concern as many children and disabled persons have been left unaccompanied.\nThe UN, the World Food Programme (WFP), and other associated humanitarian organizations have been on the frontlines of this disaster, providing aid and food. It is imperative for donors to contribute financially in aid efforts as the $927 million Humanitarian Response Plan for Nigeria has only been 46 percent funded.",

In addition, 73,582 houses have collapsed, and 17,762 livestock have been killed.\n-\nMaradi is the most affected region, with 206,096 people affected, followed by Dosso (115,797 people) Tillaberi (112,126 people), Zinder (96,526 people), Tahoua (94,221 people), Diffa (50,212 people), Niamey (19,340 people), and Agadez (16,449 people).\n-\nHealth and education infrastructures have been impacted by the floods. 3,821 classrooms and 512 school latrines have been impacted, with 1,452 classrooms and 240 school latrines completely collapsed. In addition, 1,246 classrooms are being used as shelters for displaced families. This situation could disrupt the education of 55,969 students, including 47.7% girls, and 1,413 teachers when schools resume in mid-October 2024.\n-\nIn flood-affected areas, the lack of adequate sanitation increases health risks for the population, especially waterborne diseases such as cholera.\n-\nAs of 30 July 2024, there are 413,906 refugees and asylum seekers, and 507,438 internally displaced people in Niger, primarily in the regions of Diffa, Maradi, Tahoua, and Tillab\u00e9ri (Government & UNHCR).\nUNICEF\u2019s Response\nHealth\n-\nIn Maradi, Zinder, Tahoua, Dosso and Tillaberi regions, flooding has severely affected health centres, limiting access, and forcing the relocation of critical medical equipment to prevent damage.\n-\nIn Agadez region, four health centres have been flooded, three have been damaged, and another is at risk of collapsing.\n-\nIn Tahoua region, flooding has made clay roads impassable, significantly impacting health programmes in Bagaroua, Abalak, Tchintabaraden, Bouza, and Konni health districts. Access for mobile outreach has been limited, which is disrupting the provision of essential health services such as vaccinations and regular medical consultations.\n-\nFurthermore, this situation has led to a heightened risk for cholera and malaria. UNICEF has prepositioned six malaria and 84 cholera detection and treatment kits in flood-affected regions and distributed ten kits (five Acute Watery Diarrhoea Periphery Kit Drug and five AWD Community Kit Drug) to tackle acute watery diarrhoea in affected communities.\n-\nIn Maradi region, 30 healthcare providers were trained in paediatric malaria management, and two malaria kits were distributed (one for the Regional Hospital Centre and one for the Mother and Child Heath Centre - CSME) to treat 2,000 complicated cases. Cholera rapid diagnostic kits for 680 people were positioned and community engagement initiatives, involving seven community radios and local leaders, were implemented in 17 neighbourhoods. Additionally, 600 cholera prevention messaging tools were provided through health centres and WASH partners, with financial support provided to the Regional Directorate of Public Health (DRSP) for these community engagement activities.\n-\nIn Dosso region, UNICEF supported the distribution of health care kits for 30,000 people for 3 months and the and the provision of 214 cholera prevention leaflets in French, Hausa, and Djerma through WASH partners.\n-\nIn Tillaberi region, a flood damage assessment of health structures was conducted with the support of the DRSP.

Schools are closed with some serving as temporary relocation sites.\n\u2022 Two major bridges in Maiduguri (Lagos Street Bridge and Gwange Bridge) have partially collapsed.\n\u2022 Over 300,000 people have been registered in at least 26 relocation sites, as of 14 September, according to the Borno State Government\u2019s Emergency Operations Centre. Up to 30 sites have been set up and registration is ongoing.\n\u2022 In support of Government efforts, the UN and partners are responding to immediate food (wet feeding), water, health and shelter and sanitation needs.\n\u2022 Interventions to prevent outbreaks of acute watery diarrhea and cholera are ongoing.\n\u2022 The flooding is happening at the height of a food and nutrition crisis \u2013 the lean season. \u2022 On 14 September a high-level delegation led by the Humanitarian Coordinator and comprising representatives of humanitarian agencies visited Maiduguri to express continued support for the operation and solidarity with the people of Maiduguri.\n\u2022 Link to Rapid Needs Assessment Report\n\u2022 Link to OCHA\u2019s interactive floods dashboard\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\nMore than 300,000 temporarily displaced people have been registered in 30 relocation sites following relocations from flood affected areas in the Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC), Jere and Konduga local government areas (LGAs). As of 15 September, according to the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) of the Borno State Government (BSG). This follows the flash flooding that occurred on the night of 9 September, when the Alau Dam collapsed wreaking havoc across MMC and Jere.\nAccess remains restricted with key infrastructure such as the Gwange and Lagos Street bridges in Maiduguri collapsing or partially collapsing. The Muna camp, which is housing approximately 57,000 people, of whom 6,000 are new arrivals, remains cut off from the main city, markets and other services by flood waters. Other communities also remain isolated. The local telecommunications and electricity networks continue to be disconnected in some areas. The main market (Monday Market) in Maiduguri is still flooded, affecting access to food with markets moving to other parts of Maiduguri often disrupting road traffic and potentially causing security issues.\nThe numbers of people registered in relocation sites and the number of sites keep increasing. Many sites are crowded with open defecation taking place. Priority needs among affected people are food assistance, wet feeding (most people affected have lost stoves and cooking utensils), potable water, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and safe shelters within the camps. There is also urgent need for protection activities to reduce the risk of gender-based violence, as well as protection of unaccompanied children, including tracing their families. A key priority is to prevent outbreaks of communicable disease, including cholera, ramping up WASH activities to ensure adequate coverage of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. This will also require surveillance for disease and preparedness for outbreaks. It is also expected that cases of malaria and other vector borne disease will increase.\nGovernment authorities have relocated residents in high-risk areas to multiple relocation sites. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) is helping set up and manage temporary camps in Maiduguri and conducting search and rescue operations, while the Nigerian military has activated 22 disaster response units in Borno and across north-east Nigeria to help reach inaccessible areas and undertake search and rescue for people trapped by the flooding.\nIn support of Government efforts, the UN and partners are providing hot meals, water purification tablets, hygiene/dignity kits and cholera kits, as well as emergency health services, among other lifesaving interventions. The UN is also conducting joint rapid needs assessments with authorities to inform the emergency response.\nDisclaimer\n- UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n- To learn more about OCHA's activities, please visit https://www.unocha.org/.",

        "content": "title: Nigeria: 200m Nigerians At Risk of 17 Neglected Diseases, As Unicef Calls for Urgent Action \n content: The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has warned of a looming health crisis in Nigeria, as 200 million citizens are at risk of contracting 17 Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).\nThe organisation highlighted the urgent need to address open defecation as a key driver of these diseases.\nAt a two-day media dialogue in Lagos, UNICEF's Chief of WASH, Jane Bevan, emphasised the preventable nature of NTDs like schistosomiasis, trachoma, and intestinal worms.\nShe stressed that the continued practice of open defecation, poor hygiene, and lack of access to clean water significantly exacerbate the vulnerability of millions to these diseases.\nAccording to the WASH National Routine Mapping (WASHNORM), 47 million people in Nigeria practice open defecation, while only 18 percent of the population has access to safely managed sanitation services. Ebonyi State leads in open defecation rates, followed by Plateau State, while Zamfara State has the lowest rate.\nAddressing journalists during a two-day media dialogue on \"Ending Open Defecation in Nigeria and Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases\" in Lagos, UNICEF Chief of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Jane Bevan said many of the NTDs are transmitted through poor sanitation, adding that \"Unless we all practice safe sanitation and hygiene, there is a risk that we will all get more NTDs.\nBevan said that practicing hand washing is perhaps the most affordable immunisation that all Nigerians, including children, can receive that will actually assist to save lives and avoid some of these diseases\n\"We have been able to achieve 126 open defecation-free LGAs in the country and we are working hard to ensure more LGAs achieve open defecation-free (ODF) status,\" she added.\nTo combat this crisis, UNICEF and its partners are intensifying efforts to end open defecation by 2030. This involves constructing sanitation facilities, implementing hygiene education programs, and engaging communities to promote behavioral change.\nBevan stressed that ending open defecation is crucial for reversing the trend of NTDs, adding that practicing handwashing is a simple yet effective way to prevent these diseases.\nAlso speaking, UNICEF WASH Specialist, Monday Johnson, echoed this sentiment, highlighting Nigeria's high burden of NTDs and the role of open defecation in spreading them.\nUNICEF WASH Specialist, Mr Monday Johnson said Nigeria has the highest NTD burden in Africa and open defecation remained a significant contributor to the spread.\nHe listed some of the NTDs to include; onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH), among others are transmitted through contaminated soil and faeces, perpetuating a cycle of poverty, malnutrition, and ill health.\n\"By addressing open defecation, we can significantly reduce the transmission of NTDs, improved sanitation and hygiene practices can break the cycle of infection, protecting vulnerable populations, especially children and women\", he added.\nLinking how open defecation fuels NTDs, Johnson said: \"NTDs are a proxy for poverty which prevails among vulnerable and marginalised populations. NTDs and poor access to WASH contribute to a vicious cycle of poverty and disease. NTDs can lead to catastrophic health expenditure and reduced economy.\nOn what UNICEF is doing to end open defecation in Nigeria, Johnson said UNICEF works very closely with governments and the Clean Nigeria Campaign to make a difference on the issue of poor sanitation and open defecation in the country.\nThe National Coordinator of the Clean Nigeria Campaign, Mrs Chizoma Opara, acknowledged the challenges in achieving open defecation-free status by 2030, including infrastructure deficits, funding gaps, and weak policies.\nShe emphasized the need for increased investment in sanitation facilities and stronger government commitment.\nDespite these challenges, Opara expressed optimism about the campaign's potential to achieve its goals of eliminating open defecation, improving sanitation coverage, and implementing effective fecal sludge management systems..\nAlso speaking, UNICEF's communication officer, Blessing Ejiofor, urged the media to raise awareness about the dangers of open defecation and the need to end this practice, emphasizing that addressing sanitation is crucial for achieving broader health goals in Nigeria.",

        "content": "title: 200m Nigerians at risk of 17 neglected diseases, as UNICEF calls for urgent action \n content: By Chioma Obinna\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has warned of a looming health crisis in Nigeria, as 200 million citizens are at risk of contracting 17 Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).\nThe organisation highlighted the urgent need to address open defecation as a key driver of these diseases.\nAt a two-day media dialogue in Lagos, UNICEF\u2019s Chief of WASH, Jane Bevan, emphasised the preventable nature of NTDs like schistosomiasis, trachoma, and intestinal worms.\nShe stressed that the continued practice of open defecation, poor hygiene, and lack of access to clean water significantly exacerbate the vulnerability of millions to these diseases.\nAccording to the WASH National Routine Mapping (WASHNORM), 47 million people in Nigeria practice open defecation, while only 18 percent of the population has access to safely managed sanitation services. Ebonyi State leads in open defecation rates, followed by Plateau State, while Zamfara State has the lowest rate.\nAddressing journalists during a two-day media dialogue on \u201cEnding Open Defecation in Nigeria and Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases\u201d in Lagos, UNICEF Chief of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Jane Bevan said many of the NTDs are transmitted through poor sanitation, adding that \u201cUnless we all practice safe sanitation and hygiene, there is a risk that we will all get more NTDs.\nBevan said that practicing hand washing is perhaps the most affordable immunisation that all Nigerians, including children, can receive that will actually assist to save lives and avoid some of these diseases\n\u201cWe have been able to achieve 126 open defecation-free LGAs in the country and we are working hard to ensure more LGAs achieve open defecation-free (ODF) status,\u201d she added.\nTo combat this crisis, UNICEF and its partners are intensifying efforts to end open defecation by 2030. This involves constructing sanitation facilities, implementing hygiene education programs, and engaging communities to promote behavioral change.\nBevan stressed that ending open defecation is crucial for reversing the trend of NTDs, adding that practicing handwashing is a simple yet effective way to prevent these diseases.\nAlso speaking, UNICEF WASH Specialist, Monday Johnson, echoed this sentiment, highlighting Nigeria\u2019s high burden of NTDs and the role of open defecation in spreading them.\nUNICEF WASH Specialist, Mr Monday Johnson said Nigeria has the highest NTD burden in Africa and open defecation remained a significant contributor to the spread.\nHe listed some of the NTDs to include; onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH), among others are transmitted through contaminated soil and faeces, perpetuating a cycle of poverty, malnutrition, and ill health.\n\u201cBy addressing open defecation, we can significantly reduce the transmission of NTDs, improved sanitation and hygiene practices can break the cycle of infection, protecting vulnerable populations, especially children and women\u201d, he added.\nLinking how open defecation fuels NTDs, Johnson said: \u201cNTDs are a proxy for poverty which prevails among vulnerable and marginalised populations. NTDs and poor access to WASH contribute to a vicious cycle of poverty and disease. NTDs can lead to catastrophic health expenditure and reduced economy.\nOn what UNICEF is doing to end open defecation in Nigeria, Johnson said UNICEF works very closely with governments and the Clean Nigeria Campaign to make a difference on the issue of poor sanitation and open defecation in the country.\nThe National Coordinator of the Clean Nigeria Campaign, Mrs Chizoma Opara, acknowledged the challenges in achieving open defecation-free status by 2030, including infrastructure deficits, funding gaps, and weak policies.\nShe emphasized the need for increased investment in sanitation facilities and stronger government commitment.\nDespite these challenges, Opara expressed optimism about the campaign\u2019s potential to achieve its goals of eliminating open defecation, improving sanitation coverage, and implementing effective fecal sludge management systems..\nAlso speaking, UNICEF\u2019s communication officer, Blessing Ejiofor, urged the media to raise awareness about the dangers of open defecation and the need to end this practice, emphasizing that addressing sanitation is crucial for achieving broader health goals in Nigeria.",

        "content": "title: FG warns N'Delta, southern states of rising waters; reveals cause of Maiduguri flood \n content: File image of flooded Maiduguri.\nBy Gabriel Ewepu, Abuja\nThe Federal Government has issued a warning to the Niger Delta and southern states to brace for possible floods.\nAlso, the government revealed that the recent devastating Maiduguri flood was caused by the overflow of the Ngadda River, not a collapse of the Alau Dam as initially speculated.\nDuring a press briefing, the Minister of Water Resources and Sanitation, Engineer Joseph Utsev, clarified that the Alau Dam, located in Maiduguri, Borno State, remained intact.\nHe explained that the flood resulted from massive inflows from the Ngadda River, a major tributary of the River Yedzaram, which overwhelmed the dam\u2019s dyke.\nUtsev, alongside the Minister of State for Water Resources and Sanitation, Bello Goronyo, visited the flood-affected areas to assess the damage and express their sympathies to the government and people of Borno State.\nUtsev expressed commitment to a thorough overhaul and upgrade of the Alau Dam. He said it is non-negotiable, and any poor performance by contractors or officials involved will not go unpunished.\nHe promised to provide sanitation kits and water treatment facilities to displaced persons as part of the ministry\u2019s immediate intervention.\nHowever, the minister explained that the delay in arrival was due to prior irrigation inspections in the southwest. But he reassured that the Alau Dam would be prioritised.\nCause of Maiduguri flood\nHe said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t actually envisage that the level of the water that comes this year it will be of this magnitude.\n\u201cBecause of the climate change, the downpour was in excess, and the rivers could not actually contain the water. And more water that was unexpected was being spilled into Alau Dam, and it has spilled over the dyke.\n\u201cAlau Dam did not collapse. It was one of the dykes that could not hold excess water coming from the tributaries, so it overflowed the dam.\n\u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria and indeed the Federal Ministry of Water Resources and Sanitation deeply sympathise with the government and the good people of Borno State on the flood disaster that befell us a few days ago.\n\u201cThis flood disaster, directly and indirectly affected millions of Nigerians, destroying homes, property, farmlands, roads, critical infrastructure and assets, among others. I identify with you all as we progress to navigate through this difficult time.\n\u201cThis flood disaster that affected Maiduguri and Jere areas of Borno State was largely due to overflow of water from Alau Dam which is about 10 kilometers from Maiduguri city centre owing to massive inflow from Ngadda river, a major tributary of River Yedzaram.\n\u201cThe Minister of State, Bello Mohammad Goronyo, and I have visited Maiduguri with heads of agencies and parastatals in my Ministry to express solidarity with the Governor, Borno State and to assess the extent of devastation caused by the flood.\n\u201cAs I speak now, the team of technical experts from the Ministry, National Water Resources Institute (NWRI) and the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) including Chad Basin Development Authority are physically on ground to assess the situation in Alau Dam and the extent of the flood disaster and come up with useful findings and recommendations.\u201d\nMeanwhile, according to the Minister, reports of similar visits in Bauchi, Sokoto and Kebbi states have been produced and action is being taken.\nAlso, he warned that the water people drink may be contaminated, \u201cwe should please be mindful of this, so as to avoid further outbreak of waterborne and communicable diseases.\u201d\nLooming flood disaster\nHowever, he warned that there is going to be serious flooding in the Niger Delta region and other southern states. Hence, the government and people should activate emergency measures to mitigate the impact.\n\u201cAs we mourn the losses in Borno, Yobe, Jigawa, Bauchi and other states affected by flooding, the attention of Nigerians is hereby drawn to the probable flooding on rivers Niger and Benue and some of their tributaries.\n\u201cThe daily flow on these rivers indicates significant increase in flow levels tending towards red alert.\n\u201cThis warning means that a large volume of water is moving through our rivers down to the delta region.\n\u201cTherefore, we should increase vigilance on all ramifications and step up proactive measures to address any eventual flooding events in the southern part of the country,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "Nigeria: Flooding in Nigeria - A Case of Climate Change or Governmental Failure?",
        "content": "title: Nigeria: Flooding in Nigeria - A Case of Climate Change or Governmental Failure? \n content: Flooding in Nigeria has become an annual catastrophe that wreaks havoc across the nation, displacing thousands, destroying properties and causing untold suffering. Each rainy season, the nation braces for the inevitable: swollen rivers, submerged homes and communities stranded by rising waters. But as we witness these disasters unfold year after year, we must confront a pressing question: Are these floods simply a manifestation of climate change, or are they the result of government failure to develop adequate infrastructure to manage water flow?\nThere is no denying that climate change plays a significant role in the increased frequency and severity of floods in Nigeria. Changes in global weather patterns have led to more intense and unpredictable rainfall, which contributes to flooding.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that climate change exacerbates extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall, which Nigeria has experienced in recent years.\nNigeria's geographical location also makes it particularly vulnerable to climate change. The country is situated in a region where the climate is already volatile, with the northern part of the country facing desertification and the southern part dealing with excessive rainfall and flooding. This dual challenge is a clear indication that Nigeria is on the front lines of the climate crisis.\nWhile climate change is a contributing factor, it cannot be the sole scapegoat for Nigeria's flooding woes. A significant part of the problem lies in the government's consistent failure to develop and maintain adequate infrastructure that can handle heavy rainfall and manage water flow. The lack of proper urban planning, inadequate drainage systems, and insufficient investment in flood control measures have left many communities vulnerable to flooding.\nNigeria's major cities, such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Abuja, are plagued by poor drainage systems that quickly become overwhelmed during heavy rains. The government's failure to enforce building regulations has also led to the construction of structures on floodplains and other vulnerable areas, exacerbating the impact of floods.\nFurthermore, the absence of effective waste management systems means that drains are often clogged with debris, reducing their capacity to channel water away from populated areas.\nThe paradox in Nigeria's flood crisis lies in the coexistence of both climate change and governmental failure as primary causes. It is a complex interplay where one issue exacerbates the other. Climate change-induced heavy rains would not cause as much devastation if there were proper infrastructure in place to manage water flow. Conversely, the impact of inadequate infrastructure is magnified by the increasing intensity of rainfall due to climate change.\nNigeria's government must recognize that while they cannot control the climate, they have the power and responsibility to build resilient systems that can mitigate the effects of climate change. This involves investing in modern drainage systems, enforcing strict building codes, ensuring proper waste management, and engaging in comprehensive urban planning that considers the changing climate.\nAddressing Nigeria's flood problem requires a multi-faceted approach. First and foremost, the government must acknowledge its role in the crisis and take immediate steps to improve infrastructure. This includes repairing and upgrading existing drainage systems, constructing new ones where needed, and developing sustainable urban planning policies that prevent construction in flood-prone areas.\nIn addition, there must be a greater emphasis on climate change adaptation strategies. This involves creating early warning systems for floods, educating communities about the risks and responses to flooding, and investing in research to better understand the impacts of climate change on Nigeria's hydrology.\nInternational cooperation is also crucial. Nigeria should seek technical and financial support from international bodies to help build its resilience against climate-induced disasters. Moreover, there needs to be a national policy framework that integrates climate adaptation with disaster risk management.\nNigeria's flood crisis is not solely a result of climate change or governmental failure, but rather a combination of both. The government must rise to the challenge by investing in the necessary infrastructure and implementing effective policies that address both immediate needs and long-term resilience. Only then can Nigeria hope to mitigate the devastating impacts of floods and protect its citizens from future disasters.\nMurkthar Suleiman resides in Abuja and can be reached via [email protected]",

        "content": "title: Maiduguri Deadly Flood: Inside ill-fated dam, 3rd disaster in 32 years \n content: \u2022Our cry to fix major cracks fell on deaf ears \u2013 Survivor\nBy Ndahi Marama\nLast Tuesday, many residents of Maiduguri and Jere Local Government Area of Borno State were displaced, no thanks to an \u201cunavoidable\u201d disaster that wreaked havoc on residents.\nIt was the third disaster in 32 years, the first two having occurred in 1992 and 2012 respectively.\nFollowing the flood that submerged parts of Borno, an unspecified number of people and domestic animals lost their lives, with houses and critical infrastructures worth billions of naira wiped out.\nThe National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, had said the flood began after the Alau Dam overflowed following heavy rains.\nExperts also said a reason for the flood was the inflow of water into Alau and Jere Bowl which depends mainly on the inflow from Ngaddabul River.\nThey said the Ngaddabul River, a tributary of River Yedzeram, which originates in the Hudu Hills East of Mubi in Adamawa, flows northwest to Lake Chad.\nWhile explaining that the dam is under the management of the Chad Basin Development Authority, experts told Sunday Vanguard that during the wet season, Yedseram River contributes massive inflow of water into the Ngaddabul River, which then flows into Alau and Jere Bowl.\nAccording to them, during years of low rainfall, the Yedseram River does not contribute as much water to the Ngadda River.\nAlau Dam\nConstructed in 1984 and put to use in the year 1986, Alau Dam provides water for irrigation and domestic use in Maiduguri and serves as a means to control flood in the area.\nHowever, Sunday Vanguard learnt that the dam has also been the cause of flooding in some cases.\nIn 1992, for instance, the dam reached its maximum level and spilled over, causing flood in Jere Bowl.\nIn 2012, torrential rainfall caused the Alau Dam to open its evacuation valve, releasing a massive amount of water that caused flood in Maiduguri and surrounding areas. On September 9, 2024, the dam collapsed following heavy rains that resulted in floods that inundated up to 40 per cent of Maiduguri and killed more than 80 per cent of animals in the Sanda Kyarimi Park Zoo.\n- Past administrations\nChecks revealed that various administrations including President Bola Tinubu have allocated funds for the dam\u2019s rehabilitation. With N285 million in 2020 and N200 million in 2023, the highest allocations were made under the Muhammadu Buhari government.\nThe 2012, 2013 and 2016 budgets specifically described the repairs for which the Federal Government appropriated funds.\nIn 2012, for instance, N11 million was allocated for a desilting exercise and a hydrographic survey on the dam.\nAnother N12 million went to the reservoir desilting in 2013. More allocations followed, including N10 million in 2016 to rehabilitate dyke 1, 2 and 3 in the dam. Since 2017, however, the money for ongoing rehabilitation could not be properly appropriated for the purpose intended.\nExperts, residents speak\nCommenting on the incident, a 70-year-old resident of Gwange Ward, Usman Adams, recounted to Sunday Vanguard: \u201cA flash flood from the Yedseram River caused extensive flooding in Maiduguri many years ago.\u201d\nProviding the root cause of the latest flooding, former Managing Director of Chad Basin Development Authority in Maiduguri, Engineer Abubakar Iliya, said: \u201cSome of the factors include the total collapse of the two or three dykes, which led to overflow of the dam. There was also an incident of discharging water since January from the dam holes, with little or no spillway and the downpour experienced this year.\u201d\nA water irrigation engineer, who did not want his name in print, attributed the flood to negligence on the part of the government.\nHe said: \u201cHad there been a proper check and management, the level of flood should not have been so devastating. The excess water should have been channeled to other usage or tributaries not directly linking the city of Maiduguri.\u201d\nAnother resident of Alau Dam, who specialises in fish farming, said: \u201cI have been into fishing business for the past 29 years, but this year, some of us witnessed some major cracks around the dam and the dykes. Consequently, we alerted the authorities, but all our concerns fell on deaf ears, hence the damage to lives and properties. It is very unfortunate.\u201d\nCasualties\nNo fewer than two million people are displaced and currently taking refuge at various camps, just as many are still trapped in the flood.\nAt press time, Gwom, Muna, 505 Housing Estate, Dikwa low-cost housing units and a host of others are still inaccessible, even as rescue teams battle to save lives and properties.\nThe Borno State government has, however, established a dedicated relief fund to provide urgent assistance to those affected.\nThe government has further pledged to mobilise support from citizens, organisations and international partners to alleviate the suffering of victims and expedite their recovery.",

        "content": "title: Nigeria: Flood Deaths in North East \n content: The recent floods in Nigeria, especially in the North East, have unveiled a harrowing chapter in the region's ongoing struggle with environmental and humanitarian crises. With countless lives lost and entire communities submerged, the flooding disaster underscores the urgent need for comprehensive disaster management and sustained support for affected populations.\nAt least 170 people have died, and more than 200,000 others displaced following weeks of flooding in Nigeria, with the North East most hit. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said at least 53 people have lost their lives to the floods in the North East.\nThe affected states, according to NEMA report, are Bauchi (23), Taraba (11), Yobe (10), and Adamawa (7), while Borno has recorded 2 deaths so far. Also, Jigawa recorded 34 deaths, Bayelsa 25, Kano 25, Zamfara 13, Sokoto 10, Niger 5, Ebonyi 2, Kaduna 2 and Nasarawa 1, making the number of people that have died in this year's flood 170.\nRELATED: NEMA Alerts Benue, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, 3 Others On Possible Flooding\nThe federal government had said 148 LGAs in 31 states are at risk of severe flooding from April to November 2024, a situation which has led to the killing of 170 people nationwide. A total of 249 LGAs in 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), are considered 'moderate flood risk states.'\nThe North East region of Nigeria, already grappling with the aftermath of years of insurgency and economic instability, has been further battered by severe flooding. Torrential rains and inadequate drainage systems have led to widespread inundation, displacing thousands and causing extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, and agricultural lands. The human toll is devastating, with reports of numerous fatalities and injuries compounding the region's suffering.\nThe floods have exacerbated vulnerabilities, particularly among displaced persons and impoverished communities. For many, the destruction of homes and livelihoods has pushed them further into poverty, creating a dire need for emergency aid and long-term recovery strategies.\nThe death toll from the floods is a stark reminder of the human cost of inadequate disaster preparedness and response. Lives lost to drowning, diseases related to water contamination, and the collapse of structures underline the urgent need for improved infrastructure and early warning systems. Each statistic represents not just a number but a person whose life was tragically cut short by preventable circumstances.\nThe North East's flooding crisis highlights significant disaster management and preparedness gaps. The region's infrastructure is inadequate to handle extreme weather events, and logistical challenges and resource constraints have hampered the response.\nGovernment responses have included some emergency relief efforts, but these have been criticised for their lack of coordination and scale. The response has often been reactive rather than proactive, with insufficient attention to building resilience and preparedness for future disasters.\nAddressing the flooding crisis requires a multifaceted approach beyond immediate relief efforts. Investing in robust drainage systems and flood defences is crucial. Improved infrastructure can mitigate the impact of heavy rains and reduce the risk of flooding in vulnerable areas.\nDeveloping and implementing effective early warning systems can provide timely alerts to communities, allowing them to prepare and evacuate if necessary. This requires both technological advancements and community education.\nA coordinated response involving government agencies, humanitarian organisations, and local stakeholders is essential. Clear communication and collaboration can ensure that aid is distributed efficiently and reaches those who need it most.\nBeyond immediate relief, there must be a focus on long-term recovery and rebuilding. Support for affected individuals and families, including financial aid, psychological support, and rebuilding assistance, is vital for restoring normalcy and fostering resilience.\nThe floods in the North East are a clarion call for a renewed commitment to disaster preparedness and humanitarian assistance. As the nation grapples with the aftermath, there is an opportunity to build a more resilient and responsive disaster management framework that can better protect vulnerable populations in the future.\nWe must harness the lessons learned from this disaster to drive meaningful change. By investing in infrastructure, enhancing early warning systems, and fostering community resilience, Nigeria can better prepare for and mitigate the impacts of future natural calamities. The lives lost and the suffering endured must serve as a catalyst for progress, ensuring that preventable disasters do not claim more lives.\nSolidarity and action are critical in this moment of crisis. Let us as a nation and government unite to support the affected communities and work towards a safer, more resilient future for all.",

        "content": "title: Government, Partners, and Northern Traditional Leaders Reaffirm Commitment to Nigeria\u2019s Immunisation and Health Services Goals \n content: Abuja, 9 September, 2024 -- The World Health Organization Country Representative in Nigeria (WR), Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, has reaffirmed the organisation's unrelenting commitment to supporting the government of Nigeria to achieve its goal of stopping all forms of polio transmission and strengthening routine immunisation while building a resilient healthcare system across the country.\nDr Mulombo's remarks came during the Northern Traditional Leaders' Committee (NTLC) on Primary Health Care Service Delivery quarterly review meeting in Abuja, organised by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA).\nDuring the strategic meeting, Dr Mulombo appreciated the critical historical role of the traditional and religious leaders in ensuring Nigeria eradicates all forms of poliovirus.\nUrging them not to relent in their effort, he said, \"The committee has the most critical framework with the necessary resources to put a stop to the transmission of the Circulating Variant poliovirus Type 2 (cVPV2) as well as improve the overall Primary Healthcare (PHC) Service delivery and ultimately achieve Universal Health Coverage for Nigerians.\nAppreciating the government for providing an environment that enables the NTLC's functionality, he added that the WHO would continue to support the country in building its health workforce's capacity to create a resilient health system.\nHe also stated that with the recently affirmed Local Government Authority (LGA)autonomy, WHO has already initiated engagement with the Amalgamation of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) leadership on health system strengthening (HSS) and human resource for health (HRH).\nWHO has been supporting Nigeria in its fight against all forms of poliovirus through strengthening immunisation campaigns and building the capacity of its health workforce to build a resilient health system.\nCritical Role of Vaccines in Combating Diseases\nIn an earlier remark, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Professor Muhammad Ali Pate, emphasised the critical role vaccines have played in combating diseases, particularly in the face of challenges posed by misinformation and the influence of social media.\nHe also highlighted that the role played by the traditional and religious leaders in safeguarding the communities' health and well-being over the years cannot be overstated.\n\"Over the past 15 years, the NTLC has been instrumental in advancing efforts to expand immunisation and transform primary healthcare in Nigeria. One of Nigeria's key achievements in recent years is the successful eradication of the wild poliovirus.\nThe Minister said there are viruses, if not controlled, that can be exported, and Nigeria would not like to be in that position. He, therefore, urged the traditional leaders with communities sharing international borders with other countries to prepare for a campaign in October so that Nigeria can have the best possible immunisation campaign,\nIn parallel, the Minister appreciated the roles of development partners and non-governmental organisations, including Mr Bill Gates, Aliko Dangote, WHO, and others, for supporting the government and NTLC.\nRecognition of Progress and the Call for Continued Support\nIn his goodwill message, the Co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Mr Gates, also appreciated the NTLC and the level of progress made in the fight against polio in the country despite challenges of anti-polio sentiments and insecurity.\nWhile appreciating Nigeria's effort to maintain a wild polio-free status despite the numerous challenges, he commended 86% coverage achieved for the HPV campaign, describing it as one of the best globally.\nIn their remarks, the Emir of Arugungu, who is also the Chairman of the NTLC on polio eradication, and the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa'ad Abubakar, reiterated their strong commitment to this cause, saying that NTLC will not rest until every eligible child are reached with the polio vaccine, routine immunisation and quality healthcare services.\nThey also called on Mr Gates and partners to support the NTLC with additional funding and for the Minister of Health to continue to provide the enabling environment for the NTLC to function more efficiently.\nTraditional Leaders at the Forefront of Public Health Interventions\nIn Nigeria, achieving success in public health interventions demands trust, community engagement and culturally tailored strategies, and the northern traditional and religious leaders have been at the forefront of the effort to drive successful implementations of vaccination campaigns and health education initiatives for disease prevention measures.\nThe committee is pivotal in improving maternal and child health by advocating for safe childbirth practices and promoting access to prenatal and postnatal care. These efforts have led to healthier outcomes for mothers and children.\nAlso, the committee's advocacy has enhanced routine immunisation coverage, especially in remote and underserved areas. However, there is still much work to be done to reduce the number of zero-dose children.\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nHammanyero, Kulchumi Isa\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Nigeria\nEmail: hammanyerok@who.int",

        "content": "title: Nigerian Media Platforms Come Together to Mobilise Humanitarian Support for Borno Flood Victims \n content: The media organisations convened to develop a coordinated media strategy aimed at raising public awareness and mobilising humanitarian aid for the victims of the flood in Borno State.\nMedia leaders in the country have set up an initiative to mobilise local and international support for citizens of the state facing humanitarian crisis resulting from the severe flooding in parts of Borno State, specifically in Maiduguri, Damask, and Bagga local government areas.\nThe initiative, led by Kadria Ahmed, Chief Executive Officer of RadioNow, brought together esteemed media outlets, including Premium Times, This Day Newspaper, Daar Communications, Channels TV, Tozali TV, VON, Women Radio, Family Love FM, and other prominent organisations.\nIt seeks to strategise, coordinate and enhance the coverage of the flood's impact. It is also concerned with supporting affected communities, raising public awareness about the disaster and mobilising humanitarian aid for victims.\nThe Chief Adviser for Sustainable Development and Humanitarian Aid in Borno State, Mairo Mandara, made an urgent call for intervention as floods continue to wreak havoc across Maiduguri, Damasak, and Bagga.\nSpeaking during the virtual meeting with the media executives on Wednesday, Mrs Mandara highlighted the deteriorating conditions of displaced residents, including severe food shortages, lack of rescue vehicles, and the overcrowding of unsanitary camps.\n\"The situation in Borno is bad; people are still trapped, with no access to food and a shortage of high vehicles and choppers,\" she said.\nShe emphasised the dire public health risks due to the poor living conditions in the camps, urging swift action to prevent a health crisis.\nIn response, media leaders across proposed several immediate measures, including the creation of a real-time WhatsApp situation room to track the flood's impact and deliver updates, in efforts to mitigate the crisis.\nThey also plan to launch unified radio and digital campaigns to solicit donations and direct the public to verified donation channels. Additionally, the group intends to leverage social media influencers to amplify the crisis using targeted hashtags.\nThe coalition also committed to framing the floods as a national emergency to attract more attention from both the federal government and international aid agencies.\nThe floods, which have submerged large portions of Maiduguri and surrounding areas, have displaced thousands. Although floodwaters have begun to recede in some areas, the need for immediate relief remains critical.\nThe media organisations involved have pledged to continue their coverage and support for the victims as the crisis unfolds.\nBackground\nMaiduguri, the capital of Borno State, is grappling with widespread flooding following the collapse of the Alau Dam, which had been at full capacity for a week, PREMIUM TIMES reported.\nOn Tuesday, the Commissioner for Information and Internal Security in Borno State, Usman Tar, issued a statement urging residents along riverbanks to evacuate immediately.\n\"Due to the exceptionally high water levels, we urge all residents living near the riverbanks to take immediate action to safeguard their lives and properties,\" said Mr Tar, a professor.\nHe added that the collapse of the Alau Dam had breached another channel, causing destruction to farmlands and threatening nearby communities.\nHe urged residents to follow designated routes to ensure safe passage. The last time such a breach occurred was in 1994, which resulted in extensive flooding across Maiduguri.\nMeanwhile, the Director-General of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Barkindo Mohammed, described the situation as \"catastrophic.\"\nSome media reports indicated that floodwaters from the collapsed dam have submerged vast parts of Maiduguri, leaving thousands displaced and searching for higher ground. Heavy rainfall across the state has worsened the flooding in Biu, Chibok, Konduga, Bama, Dikwa, and Jere Local Government Areas.\nSEMA is conducting rescue operations while distributing sandbags to mitigate further damage. \"We're in the field conducting rescue operations, but the situation is overwhelming,\" said Mr Mohammed. \"At one point, we found ourselves trapped while trying to assist others.\"\nFederal government speaks\nPresident Tinubu on Tuesday expressed his condolences to the victims and promised federal assistance.\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, the President referred to the disaster as \"the worst flood in decades\" and urged the immediate evacuation of residents in affected areas.\n\"The flooding, triggered by the overflow of the Alau Dam, has displaced thousands and damaged key infrastructure, including the Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and the Central Post Office,\" the statement read.\nPresident Tinubu also directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to provide urgent assistance and pledged the Federal Government's continued support.\nAlso, Vice President of Nigeria, Kashim Shettima, who spoke at the 17th Annual Banking and Finance Conference in Abuja on Tuesday, reaffirmed the government's commitment to addressing the crisis. \"After this conference, I will be heading to Maiduguri to oversee the response efforts,\" he said.\n\"This disaster is not limited to Borno; flooding is affecting communities across the country, from Bayelsa to Sokoto.\"\nMr Shettima also extended his sympathies to flood victims nationwide, assuring them that the administration would mobilise all necessary resources to provide relief.",

This period is crucial for agricultural activities, especially in the western highlands and coastal plains, where farmers begin harvesting crops like sorghum, millet, and various vegetables. The floods from the previous month have caused substantial agricultural damage, which is expected to affect food security in already vulnerable regions. This underscores the urgent need for immediate recovery efforts and improved flood management strategies for future rainy seasons. The destruction of farmland has not only delayed harvesting activities but also caused setbacks in planting for the upcoming season. These challenges highlight the importance of developing resilient agricultural practices and infrastructure to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events on Yemen's food production and rural livelihoods.\nKey Concerns:\nFlood Humanitarian Response Needs in Yemen August 2024: In August 2024, Yemen experienced severe flooding caused by unusually heavy seasonal rains, severely impacting the western and central highlands. A rapid impact assessment conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s Food Security and Nutrition Information System(Relief Web), using advanced geospatial techniques, highlighted the disaster's scale: showing that 210,084 people directly affected, 98,726 hectares of farmland damaged, and 279,400 sheep and goats impacted.\nThese flash floods, which impacted several governorates, are likely to exacerbate the already widespread malnutrition issues in the country, with children and vulnerable communities being at the highest risk. The significant damage to Yemen's agricultural sector presents both immediate and long-term threats: with immediate impact: Reduced availability of food; and long-term consequences: Weakened food security and economic stability\nTo tackle this crisis, a two-pronged approach is essential to provide urgent food and non-food assistance to affected populations and develop strategies for long-term agricultural recovery and food security. By addressing both immediate needs and implementing sustainable solutions, Yemen can work towards mitigating the disaster\u2019s impact and building resilience against future climate -related challenges.\nA gradual decrease in rainfall is expected over the next 10 days: In the upcoming days, there will be a consistent decline in rainfall intensity. Expected total precipitation will range from 60 to 100 mm in the governorates of Ibb, Dhamar, and Al Mahwit. Additionally, the coastal regions of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Arabian Sea, including Socotra Island, will see occasional showers, with total precipitation nearing 5 mm.\nResidual Flooding Poses a Threat in Key Areas: Despite the expected rainfall amounts, the risk of prolonged flooding remains in certain watersheds due to the very high soil moisture content from previous rains and residual floodwater runoff. There is a likely risk of flood resurgence in Wadi Mour, Rimah Wadi, and Zabid Wadi, all situated in the western part of the country (see fig. 1).\nExpected Threats on Population, Agriculture and Infrastructure: The anticipated rainfall and potential subsequent flooding are expected to worsen existing challenges, especially in low-lying areas where agriculture has already been heavily impacted by previous flooding episodes.\nCritical factors to consider:\n- Health risks: Lingering floodwaters create breeding grounds for disease, endangering both human and animal populations.\n- Widespread community effects: Prolonged flooding threatens crops, potentially leading to significant harvest losses and increased food scarcity. In addition, built environment: Compromised residential structures and public facilities remain vulnerable to further damage.\n- Financial impacts: Destruction of vital infrastructure and agricultural disruption may result in substantial economic setbacks at local and national scales.\nThese interconnected challenges underscore the importance of implementing holistic disaster management plans. Such strategies should aim to minimize the diverse and far-reaching impacts on affected populations, encompassing prevention, preparation, and recovery measures.\nElevated Temperatures:\nThe country is expected to experience a resurgence in high temperatures, with the northern area of Hadramaut seeing levels reach up to 44 degrees Celsius. Additionally, certain areas in the inland Eastern Plateau, along the Red Sea coast, the Gulf of Aden, and the Arabian Sea will experience temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius (refer to Fig. 2). These high temperatures foster conditions that encourage faster pest reproduction, broader geographic distribution, and increased feeding, while also facilitating the spread of diseases. When combined with the stress on crops and livestock, this enhances the risk of pest outbreaks.\nPreventive Measures:\nThe floods have had mixed effects on farmers: Some fields benefited from increased water availability during the season, whereas others suffered damage or total loss of crops, such as sorghum, millet, and vegetables. Humanitarian partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, need to develop effective response strategies to address the emergency needs of agricultural communities affected by the floods. Additionally, Early Warning systems should continue to be offered to help farmers take advantage of favourable climatic and soil conditions to boost food production in the upcoming weeks.",

        "content": "title: Maiduguri flood disaster: 2 die in stampede for food \n content: \u2022Hunger pushes non-victims into IDP camps for food palliatives\n\u2022Civilian JTF rape women, take our food\u2014Victim\n\u2022River overflow cause of flooding\u2014\u2013FG\nBy Ndahi Marama & Gabriel Ewepu\nIn their moments of distress and agony, displaced victims of the flood that caused devastation in Maiduguri, Borno state capital, who were being sheltered in Bakkasi Internally Displaced Persons, IDP, Camp, cried out yesterday that their women were being raped by members of the Civilian Joint Task Force, JTF, who also took their food and were passing it to their friends and girlfriends.\nSome of the flood victims who spoke in Hausa language to Arise television correspondent at the camp said their greatest need was food even as many residents who were not affected by the flood had found their way into camp to benefit from the palliatives meant for the flood victims. They also said two persons died from a stampede in the camp while trying to collect food. The state government of Babagana Zulum has been supplying food to the victims. Zulum even shared cash with the victims.\nSpeaking with Arise television at Bakkasi camp, one of the victims said, \u201cThe civilian JTF are raping our women and they are confiscating our food which they gave to their friends and girlfriends. What we need most now is food.\nThat is our greatest need. We are hungry. Yesterday (Thursday) in a stampede in this camp while struggling to collect food, two persons died. The flood was devastating, we are lucky we are alive\u201d. The University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital was also badly affected and patients had to be moved to the upper floors as the lower floors were completely flooded. Equipment worth hundreds of millions was affected.\nIt was also gathered that due to the current economic hardships, many residents who were not affected by the flood have stormed the various camps where the victims were given temporary shelter claiming to be victims of the flood to benefit from the food and other relief materials.\nAt the Bakkasi Camp where about 10,000 victims were profiled on the day of the incident, it was gathered that the number has increased as many of them were not genuine victims.\nRecall that initially, Governor Babagana Zulum said, over one million residents were affected, with more than 200,000 victims displaced and taking refuge at different accessible camps created by the government. The governor later reviewed the figure of the affected residents to be 2 million.\nOne of the victims from Abbaganaram, who is taking refuge with his family of five at Bakkasi camp, Mallam Yahaya Usman Abba, said he saw one of his friends who is a resident of Dala community that was not affected by the flood at the camp claiming he was also a victim. \u201cI can testify to you that there are many fake flood victims in this camp. Dala is one of the communities not affected by the flood, as it is located behind Bakkasi camp, but I saw one of my friends in this camp collecting palliatives\u201d. Abba stated.\nIt was also observed that the number of street beggars in such areas as Bags Road, Maduganari-Biu -Biu road, and Maiduguri-Gomari Airport road has increased, as many vulnerable and less privileged individuals have taken advantage of the situation disguising themselves as victims of the flood to beg for alms.\nRiver overflow cause of flooding \u2014FG\nMeanwhile, the Federal Government, Friday, declared that the Alau Dam in Maiduguri, the Borno State Capital, did not collapse as speculated, rather it was the Ngadda river overflow that caused the devastating flood. The Minister of Water Resources and Sanitation, Engr Joseph Utsev stated this during a press briefing on the situation of the Maiduguri flood, and other issues.\nUtsav alongside the Minister of State for Water Resources and Sanitation, Hon Bello Goronyo, explained that the flood was caused by massive inflow from Ngadda River, a major tributary of River Yedzaram and that he and his technical team had gone there to assess the situation of the flood.\nHe also expressed commitment to do a thorough overhaul and upgrade of the Alau Dam, saying it was non-negotiable, and any poor performance by contractors or officials involved would not go unpunished. He promised to provide sanitation kits and water treatment facilities to displaced persons as part of the ministry\u2019s immediate intervention.\nHe said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t envisage that the level of the water that comes this year will be of this magnitude. Because of climate change, the downpour was in excess, and the rivers could not contain the water, while more water was unexpected was being spilt into Alau Dam.\n\u201cThis flood disaster that affected Maiduguri and Jere areas of Borno State was largely due to overflow of water from Alau Dam which is about 10 kilometres from Maiduguri city centre owing to massive inflow from Ngadda river, a major tributary of River Yedzaram.\nHowever, he warned that there would be serious flooding in the Niger Delta region and other southern states, hence the government and people should activate emergency measures to mitigate the impact.\n\u201cAs we mourn the losses in Borno, Yobe, Jigawa, Bauchi and other states affected by flooding, the attention of Nigerians is hereby drawn to the probable river flooding on rivers Niger and Benue and some of their tributaries. The daily flow on these rivers indicates a significant increase in flow levels tending towards RED alert. This warning means that a large volume of water is moving through our rivers down to the delta region. Therefore, we should increase vigilance on all ramifications and step up proactive measures to address any eventual flooding events in the southern part of the country\u201d, he said.",

        "content": "title: Nigeria: Govt Signs N589bn Partnership With UK to Boost Education, Health, Other Sectors \n content: Abuja \u2014 The federal government yesterday signed eight partnership agreements with the United Kingdom (UK) valued at about N589 billion (\u00a3272.6 million) to boost governance, climate change, education, health, and the economy.\nThe programme implementation agreements signed by the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, Senator Abubakar Bagudu, and the UK Charge d' Affaires, Ms Cynthia Rowe, committed both countries to collaboration in those critical sectors.\nSpeaking at the ceremony in Abuja, Bagudu expressed appreciation for the UK government's support, describing it was a significant show of friendship.\nHe said the timing of the implementation agreement was significant given the downward trend of world economies, noting that \"Many economies in the world are going through turbulent times\", and that \"Nigeria and the UK are not exceptions.\"\nThe minister praised the UK's spirit of partnership, which enabled it to support other countries despite its economic challenges.\nBagudu noted that some agreements would benefit more than Nigeria, explaining that they deal with global issues.\nHe said: \"Health is no longer a local issue. COVID-19 reminded us that we have a shared universe. Climate is a universal phenomenon. Governance is no longer a local issue. Governance failure in one country can affect other countries through forced migration, conflict or the spread of arms.\"\nThe minister also highlighted President Bola Tinubu's administration's recent economic reforms, which he regretted had caused some discomfort among the people.\nHowever, he explained that they were part of its Renewed Hope agenda strategies aimed at macroeconomic stability that would stimulate local and foreign investments needed for the nation's economic revival, growth, and development.\nBagudu said the agreements recognised that despite the best efforts of a country, it might not have all the resources it needed to meet its developmental needs, adding that Nigeria was confident that with working partners, it would overcome its challenges.\nThe minister thanked the charge d'affaires for her cooperation and assistance in ensuring the consummation of the implementation agreements, which he said were the 15th to be signed by the ministry within a month.\nIn her remarks, Rowe commiserated with Nigeria over the recent flood in some states and expressed how sorry the UK was over the incident.\nShe appreciated Nigeria's long-standing cooperation and praised the Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning for being an integral partner that had shaped the relations.\nThe new implementation agreements, she said, would complement the over \u00a31 billion that had been spent on several programmes in states across the country.\nShe said: \"I am passionate about the UK's close relationship with Nigeria and working with the government to advance the country's development agenda.\n\"The signing of these important agreements today builds on our support worth over \u00a31 billion, delivering real improvements for people in health, education, governance, our work with women and girls, and helping where there is humanitarian need.\"\nFor decades, the implementation agency, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO), has been actively engaged in other sectors of the country's national development, demonstrating a long-term commitment to Nigeria's growth and stability. This includes human development, the Lake Chad Basin Conflict, UK-Nigeria People-to-People links, and economic transformation.\nThe FCDO has set four clear objectives for the partnership agreements. These include delivering honest, reliable investment, providing women and girls with the freedom to succeed, stepping up life-saving support in times of crisis, and promoting sustainable economic development.\nThese goals aim to help Nigeria attain a more stable, inclusive, resilient, healthy and prosperous polity.\nThe star agreement, with a three-year budget of N324 billion (\u00a3150 million), is the Human Assistance and Resilience Program (HARP). It aims to deliver on the integrated review of an earlier programme, \"Force for Good Agenda,\" and provide life-saving humanitarian assistance in the Northeast.\nThe Nigeria Governance and Climate Change Programme (NGCP) follows it with an N84 billion (\u00a383.8 million) spending plan.\nIt aims to support coalitions engaging with the government on areas to help resolve climate and governance problems affecting the poorest and most vulnerable Nigerians; increase state government income from internally generated revenue; mainstream climate action in the centre of state government policy, planning, and budgets; and strengthen election delivery and credibility.\nThe Strengthening Peace and Resilience in Nigeria (SPRING), which aims to reduce conflict and support Nigerian communities to better adapt to the effects of climate change, was also signed.\nWith a budget of N82 billion (\u00a338 million), SPRING will support the reduction of rural violence and increased peace, security, justice and climate resilience for citizens in volatile regions of Northern Nigeria.\nOther agreements are the Equipment Support for Health Training Institutions (ESHTI) N8.3 billion (\u00a33.8 million); Climate Resilient Infrastructure for Basic Services (CRIBS) N41 billion (\u00a319 million); Building Resilience in Nigeria's Nutrition Stockpile (BRINNS) N26 billion (\u00a312 million); and Strengthening Humanitarian Access in Nigeria (SHAN) N24 billion (\u00a311 million).\nThe last of the agreements is the Manufacture Africa, which proposes to help drive the inclusive economic transformation needed to create jobs for the future by providing technical assistance to African countries to the tune of N151 billion (\u00a370 million).",

        "content": "title: WHO pledges support to flood-displaced persons in Borno State as health facilities affected \n content: 14 September 2024\nMaiduguri, 14 September, 2024 \u2013 Following the devastating severe flash flooding that displaced thousands of people and caused significant damage across several communities in Maiduguri, Borno State Capital, the World Health Organisation Representative in Nigeria, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, has pledged the organisation's unwavering support to the affected people.\nDuring the visit to Maiduguri, Dr Mulombo visited the Governor of the state, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Garbai Elkenemi, the Government officials at the Ministry of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation & Resettlement, the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and the Internal Persons Displaced Camps (IDPs) where he reaffirmed WHO's commitment to supporting Borno in addressing the health challenges from the recent floods.\nAccompanied by the Borno State Commissioner of Health and Human Services, Professor Baba Mallam Gana, the WR assessed the situation in flood-displaced communities, including the Bakasi and Yerwa internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, where many have sought refuge.\nDr Mulombo expressed his deep concern over the impact of the disaster on the lives of the people, particularly the most vulnerable populations, including women, children, and older adults.\nHe assured the people of Borno State that WHO would continue to provide essential technical and operational support to mitigate the health impact of the floods.\nThe flood was a result of a dam (Alu dam) which broke its banks, displacing over 1 million people and heightened health risks, including cholera and other waterborne diseases, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the state. Also affected by the flood is the WHO National Polio Laboratory situated at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH).\n\"On behalf of WHO, I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the people of Borno State affected by this devastating flood. WHO stands with you during this challenging time, and we remain committed to ensuring that essential health services reach those in need, especially those displaced by this crisis.\nThe sudden flood has displaced people from their homes. We are shocked by what happened. We are here to determine the needs and support the state and federal government in addressing sudden challenges. Climate change is real,\" Dr. Mulombo stated.\nDr Mulombo reiterated WHO's dedication to working with the government of Borno State and other partners to prioritise the health and well-being of the affected populations, he noted.\nIn collaboration with the Borno State Ministry of Health, the WHO team and partners have been actively involved in responding to the health challenges the flooding poses. WHO is working closely with health authorities to strengthen disease surveillance, ensure the timely delivery of medical supplies, and prevent the outbreak of waterborne diseases.\nIn a immediate effort, WHO has provided Borno State with the support of four mobile clinics deployed in IDP Camps and minimal stocks of essential medicines and medical supplies, including Interagency Emergency Health Kits (IEHKs), basic and for malaria. Additionally, WHO has provided the support in the IDP camps to enhance the state\u2019s capacity in rapidly detecting and responding to diseases outbreaks.\nExpressing gratitude to the WHO for its continued support and collaboration in responding to the flood emergency, Professor Gana said, \"We appreciate the WHO's swift response and the ongoing support in addressing the health needs of our people.\" As we continue to provide immediate relief, we must also focus on building stronger health systems that can withstand the challenges posed by such disasters in the future.\nWhile conducting the WHO team around the state capital, Professor Gana said that the flooding had never occurred at such magnitude in the past 30 years. He noted that 14 health facilities have been affected, and thousands have been displaced.\nThe Commissioner observed that the people's immediate needs are shelter, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), food, and health services. He urged partners to support the government in providing the immediate needs of the people while the government works tediously to ensure the people return to their homes soon.\nThe Shehu of Borno, in his remark, appreciated the government and WHO for their prompt support and assistance to the people. Furthermore, he called on the government to find a lasting solution to prevent the dam from breaking its bounds in the future.\nWHO's involvement and from the health partners is part of a broader commitment to supporting the government of Borno State in addressing the health impacts of emergencies, including floods, disease outbreaks, and other humanitarian crises; as part of its ongoing support, WHO has deployed emergency health teams in flood-affected communities to assist with risk assessments, health education, and strengthening surveillance systems to detect and prevent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and malaria.\nThe floods in Borno State come when the state is already grappling with a complex humanitarian crisis caused by years of conflict and displacement. The WHO Country Representative's visit and the Organization's commitment to supporting the state underscore the importance of sustained health interventions in humanitarian settings.\nWHO's efforts in Borno State are supported by its global mandate to provide technical leadership and guidance in emergencies, ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to life-saving health services, even in the most challenging circumstances.\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please Contact:\nHammanyero, Kulchumi Isa\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Nigeria\nEmail: hammanyerok@who.int",

        "content": "title: Nigeria: Two Dead As Floods Devastate Homes, Infrastructure in Abuja Community \n content: The flooding, which occurred on Tuesday, marked the second deluge in just five days, leaving a trail of destruction and despair among the community's inhabitants.\nThe community of Agwan Hakimi, Orozo situated in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), has been left in turmoil after a devastating flood swept through the area, killing two residents and destroying vital infrastructure.\nThe flooding, which occurred on Tuesday, marked the second deluge in just five days, leaving a trail of destruction and despair among the community's inhabitants.\nIn a phone interview with PREMIUM TIMES, Chairman of the Agwan Hakimi Landlord Association, Funmilayo Patrick, confirmed the deaths of two individuals, who were swept away by the forceful waters as they attempted to cross the flood on foot. One victim, identified as Musa, was a well-known figure in the community. The identity of the second victim remains unknown. Both were buried shortly after the incident.\n\"We've experienced flooding every year for the past six years, but this is by far the worst,\" Mr Patrick said. \"We are used to it, but losing lives has left us shaken. Homes have been submerged, destroyed, and we're terrified of what the next rainfall might bring.\"\nCommunity in crisis\nThe floods have displaced at least 10 families, leaving them with no emergency shelter. Many have found temporary refuge with neighbours or relatives, but the damage to their homes remains severe. Several buildings were flooded, and one structure collapsed under the weight of the floodwaters.\n\"We don't have emergency shelters,\" said Mr Patrick. \"Families have moved in with others, but how long can that last? It's unsustainable.\"\nA weak bridge\nOne of the community's primary concerns is the deteriorating state of its sole bridge, a critical connection between Agwan Hakimi and neighbouring communities like Jaina. The bridge, which serves as a vital artery for transportation, is now at risk of collapse after being battered by the back-to-back floods. Should it fall, residents fear they will be entirely cut off from essential services such as schools, churches, and markets.\n\"If this bridge goes, we're stranded,\" he warned. \"It's the only way in and out of Agwan Hakimi. We're already isolated enough. If we lose the bridge, no help will come.\"\nCrumbling infrastructure\nAgwan Hakimi's woes go beyond the immediate flood damage. The community has long struggled with inadequate infrastructure, particularly in terms of electricity supply. Despite efforts by the community to maintain its own electrical infrastructure, including spending nearly N10 million on transformers and replacement parts, the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) has reportedly done little to help.\n\"The Landlord Association has had to fund everything ourselves,\" Mr Patrick said. \"We've paid for feeder pillars, conductor wires, poles, and even armoured cables for our transformers, but the AEDC has ignored our calls for support. We're paying them for services they're not delivering, and it's crippling local businesses.\"\nDaily power outages have left the community in disarray, with many residents filing complaints to no avail. Frustration is mounting.\n\"It's more than just the cost,\" he added. \"We're literally paying the AEDC's staff to do their jobs. And yet, here we are, still without reliable power.\"\nDesperate calls for help\nThe community has now turned to the government for help. In a statement released by the Landlord Association on Wednesday, the group issued an urgent appeal to FCT Minister Nyesom Wike, AMAC Chairman Christopher Mailalangu, Senator Ireti Kingibe, and House of Representatives member Joshua Obika to intervene before the situation worsens.\n\"We need immediate relief for the displaced families, repairs to the destroyed homes, and urgent action on the collapsing bridge,\" the statement read. \"Without prompt intervention, more lives will be lost.\"\nThe association also called for a professional assessment of flood-prone areas in the region to mitigate future disasters. For many, the emotional and physical toll of the disaster has become unbearable.\n\"We're traumatised,\" he said. \"Every time it rains, we live in fear.\"\nA community on the brinks\nThe flooding has laid bare the broader issues plaguing Agwan Hakimi. Roads are in disrepair, there is no local police post, and residents have been forced to organise their own security, costing them N500,000 per month. The strain on the community is evident.\n\"We're doing everything ourselves,\" Mr Patrick lamented. \"We spent almost N2 million reinforcing the bridge last year, only for the flood to wash it away. We can't go on like this--we need help, and we need it now.\"\nGovernment response\nFollowing inquiries from PREMIUM TIMES on Thursday, the Head of Public Affairs at the Federal Capital Territory Emergency Management Department (FEMD), Nkechi Isa, led her team to Agwan Hakimi for post assessment and profiling.\nIn a statement released on Thursday, Mrs Isa confirmed that the flood claimed one life, injured another person, and caused significant damage to homes and farmlands.\nShe attributed the disaster to a narrow culvert and poor drainage systems.\nIn response, FEMD Acting Director General, Abdulrahman Mohammed directed the AEDC to repair a power pole damaged by the floods and restore electricity to the area.\nHe also ordered the Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD) to expand the culvert to prevent future flooding.\nHe also said FEMD is planning further assessments of the farmlands and homes affected by the flooding.\nMrs Isa said as heavy rains and possible flooding are forecast in the coming weeks, authorities have warned residents to remain vigilant and make use of emergency services, including a 112 toll-free line for reporting disasters.",

        "content": "title: WHO pledges support to flood-displaced persons in Borno State as health facilities affected \n content: 14 September 2024\nMaiduguri, 14 September, 2024 \u2013 Following the devastating severe flash flooding that displaced thousands of people and caused significant damage across several communities in Maiduguri, Borno State Capital, the World Health Organisation Respentative in Nigeria, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, has pledged the organisation's support unwavering support to the affected people.\nDuring the visit to Maiduguri, Dr Mulombo visited the Governor of the state, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Garbai Elkenemi, the Government officials at the Ministry of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation & Resettlement, the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and the Internal Persons Displaced Camps (IDPs) where he reaffirmed WHO's commitment to supporting Borno in addressing the health challenges from the recent floods.\nAccompanied by the Borno State Commissioner of Health and Human Services, Professor Baba Mallam Gana, the WR assessed the situation in flood-displaced communities, including the Bakasi and Yerwa internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, where many have sought refuge.\nDr Mulombo expressed his deep concern over the impact of the disaster on the lives of the people, particularly the most vulnerable populations, including women, children, and older adults.\nHe assured the people of Borno State that WHO would continue to provide essential technical and operational support to mitigate the health impact of the floods.\nThe flood was a result of a dam (Alu dam) which broke its banks, displacing over 1 million people and heightened health risks, including cholera and other waterborne diseases, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation in the state. Also affected by the flood is the WHO National Polio Laboratory situated at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH).\n\"On behalf of WHO, I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the people of Borno State affected by this devastating flood. WHO stands with you during this challenging time, and we remain committed to ensuring that essential health services reach those in need, especially those displaced by this crisis.\nThe sudden flood has displaced people from their homes. We are shocked by what happened. We are here to determine the needs and support the state and federal government in addressing sudden challenges. Climate change is real,\" Dr. Mulombo stated.\nWR and the WHO delegates and the Commissioner of health at the Shehu's palace\nDr Mulombo reiterated WHO's dedication to working with the government of Borno State and other partners to prioritise the health and well-being of the affected populations.,\" he noted.\nIn collaboration with the Borno State Ministry of Health, the WHO team and partners have been actively involved in responding to the health challenges the flooding poses. WHO is working closely with health authorities to strengthen disease surveillance, ensure the timely delivery of medical supplies, and prevent the outbreak of waterborne diseases.\nIn a immediate effort, WHO has provided Borno State with the support of four mobile clinics deployed in IDP Camps and minimal stocks of essential medicines and medical supplies, including Interagency Emergency Health Kits (IEHKs), basic and for malaria. Additionally, WHO has provided the support in the IDP camps to enhance the state\u2019s capacity in rapidly detecting and responding to diseases outbreaks.\nExpressing gratitude to the WHO for its continued support and collaboration in responding to the flood emergency, Professor Gana said, \"We appreciate the WHO's swift response and the ongoing support in addressing the health needs of our people. \"As we continue to provide immediate relief, we must also focus on building stronger health systems that can withstand the challenges posed by such disasters in the future.\nWhile conducting the WHO team around the state capital, Professor Gana said that the flooding had never occurred at such magnitude in the past 30 years. He noted that 14 health facilities have been affected, and thousands have been displaced.\nThe Commissioner observed that the people's immediate needs are shelter, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), food, and health services. He urged partners to support the government in providing the immediate needs of the people while the government works tediously to ensure the people return to their homes soon.\nThe Shehu of Borno, in his remark, appreciated the government and WHO for their prompt support and assistance to the people. Furthermore, He called on the government to find a lasting solution to prevent the dam from breaking its bounds in the future.\nWHO's involvement and from the health partners is part of a broader commitment to supporting the government of Borno State in addressing the health impacts of emergencies, including floods, disease outbreaks, and other humanitarian crises; as part of its ongoing support, WHO has deployed emergency health teams in flood-affected communities to assist with risk assessments, health education, and strengthening surveillance systems to detect and prevent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and malaria..\nThe floods in Borno State come when the state is already grappling with a complex humanitarian crisis caused by years of conflict and displacement. The WHO Country Representative's visit and the Organization's commitment to supporting the state underscore the importance of sustained health interventions in humanitarian settings.\nWHO's efforts in Borno State are supported by its global mandate to provide technical leadership and guidance in emergencies, ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to life-saving health services, even in the most challenging circumstances.\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nHammanyero, Kulchumi Isa\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Nigeria\nEmail: hammanyerok@who.int",

        "content": "title: Nigeria Signs Multi-Billion Naira Partnership Agreements With UK \n content: The agreements commit both countries to collaboration in critical sectors, including governance, climate change, education, health, and the economy.\nNigeria is to reap about N589 billion (\u00a3272.6 million) from eight partnership agreements it signed with the United Kingdom on Wednesday in Abuja.\nThe programme implementation agreements signed by the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, Abubakar Bagudu, and the UK Charge d' Affaires, Cynthia Rowe, commit both countries to collaboration in critical sectors, including governance, climate change, education, health, and the economy.\nWelcoming Ms Rowe and her team to the signing ceremony at the ministry's headquarters in Abuja, Mr Bagudu expressed appreciation for the UK government's support, saying it was a significant show of friendship.\nHe said the timing of the implementation agreement was significant given the downward trend of world economies. \"Many economies in the world are going through turbulent times. Nigeria and the UK are not exceptions,\" he stated.\nThe minister praised the UK's spirit of partnership, which enabled it to support other countries despite its economic challenges.\nMr Bagudu noted that some agreements would benefit more than Nigeria, explaining that they deal with global issues.\n\"Health is no longer a local issue. COVID-19 reminded us that we have a shared universe. Climate is a universal phenomenon. Governance is no longer a local issue. Governance failure in one country can affect other countries through forced migration, conflict or the spread of arms,\" he said.\nThe minister spoke about President Bola Tinubu's administration's recent economic reforms, which he regretted had caused some discomfort among the people.\nHowever, he explained that they were part of its Renewed Hope Agenda strategies aimed at macroeconomic stability that would stimulate local and foreign investments needed for the nation's economic revival, growth, and development.\nMr Bagudu said the agreements recognised that despite the best efforts of a country, it might not have all the resources it needed to meet its developmental needs, adding that Nigeria was confident that with working partners, it would overcome its challenges.\nThe minister thanked the charge d'affaires for her cooperation and assistance in ensuring the consummation of the implementation agreements, which he said were the 15th to be signed by the ministry within a month.\nMs Rowe in her statement commiserated with Nigeria over the recent flood in some states and expressed how sorry the UK was over the incident.\nShe appreciated Nigeria's long-standing cooperation and praised the Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning for being an integral partner that had shaped the relations.\nThe new implementation agreements, she said, would complement the over \u00a31 billion that had been spent on several programmes in states across the country.\n\"I am passionate about the UK's close relationship with Nigeria and working with the Government to advance the country's development agenda,\" Ms Rowe said in a short statement, adding, \"The signing of these important agreements today builds on our support worth over \u00a31billion, delivering real improvements for people in health, education, governance, our work with women and girls, and helping where there is humanitarian need.\"\nFor decades, the implementation agency, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO), has been actively engaged in other sectors of the country's national development, demonstrating a long-term commitment to Nigeria's growth and stability. This includes human development, the Lake Chad Basin Conflict, UK-Nigeria People-to-People links, and economic transformation.\nThe FCDO has set four clear objectives for the partnership agreements. These include delivering honest, reliable investment, providing women and girls with the freedom to succeed, stepping up life-saving support in times of crisis, and promoting sustainable economic development. These goals aim to help Nigeria attain a more stable, inclusive, resilient, healthy and prosperous polity.\nThe star agreement, with a three-year budget of N324 billion (\u00a3150 million), is the Human Assistance and Resilience Program (HARP). It aims to deliver on the integrated review of an earlier programme, \"Force for Good Agenda,\" and provide life-saving humanitarian assistance in the North-east.\nThe Nigeria Governance and Climate Change Programme (NGCP) follows it with an N84 billion (\u00a383.8 million) spending plan. It aims to support coalitions engaging with the government on areas to help resolve climate and governance problems affecting the poorest and most vulnerable Nigerians; increase state government income from internally generated revenue; mainstream climate action in the centre of state government policy, planning, and budgets; and strengthen election delivery and credibility.\nThe Strengthening Peace and Resilience in Nigeria (SPRING), which aims to reduce conflict and support Nigerian communities to better adapt to the effects of climate change, was also signed.\nWith a budget of N82 billion (\u00a338 million), SPRING will support the reduction of rural violence and increased peace, security, justice and climate resilience for citizens in volatile regions of Northern Nigeria.\nOther agreements are the Equipment Support for Health Training Institutions (ESHTI) N8.3 billion (\u00a33.8 million); Climate Resilient Infrastructure for Basic Services (CRIBS) N41 billion (\u00a319 million); Building Resilience in Nigeria's Nutrition Stockpile (BRINNS) N26 billion (\u00a312 million); and Strengthening Humanitarian Access in Nigeria (SHAN) N24 billion (\u00a311 million).\nThe last of the agreements is the Manufacture Africa, which proposes to help drive the inclusive economic transformation needed to create jobs for the future by providing technical assistance to African countries to the tune of N151 billion (\u00a370 million).",

        "content": "title: Flood: UN allocates $6 million to Borno as WHO, others intervene \n content: To cushion the impact of the recent flooding incidents on victims in Borno State, North-east Nigeria, the United Nations has allocated $6 million to the state from the Nigeria Humanitarian Fund.\nThis amounts to N9.8 billion with the present exchange rate of N1,639 to 1 US dollar.\nAccording to UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mohamed Fall, more funding is on the way to bring the total contribution to more than $8 million.\nThe National Information Officer of the UN Information Centre, Oluseyi Soremekun, announced the various interventions in a press statement on Sunday.\n|\n|\nAccording to the statement, Mr Fall announced this allocation when he led officials of the global agency and non-governmental organisations on a visit to the conflict-ridden Borno State and met with the government officials and the victims of the flooding.\nThe groups, which also included the Nigeria Red Cross Society, visited the state on Saturday.\nHe said the funding is necessitated by the urgent need to save lives, even as the organisations pledged immediate support for the affected population.\nProvision of food, sanitation\nMr Fall said the UN is responding to the crisis by providing hot meals, facilitating food airdrops in hard-to-reach areas cut off by flood waters, trucking water and providing water and sanitation hygiene services.\nThe statement also added that the UN has provided water purification tablets to stem outbreaks of diseases, such as acute watery diarrhoea and cholera, while also providing hygiene kits for women and girls, and shelter services.\nTo provide life assistance to persons affected by the flood, the United Nations has promised continuous provision of aid and the mobilisation of additional resources.\nMr Fall said the widespread impact of the floods in Maiduguri Mretropolitan Council (MMC) and Jere LGA requires immediate response by the UN and partners in support of government efforts.\nHe said, \u201cI witnessed firsthand the devastation and untold hardship caused by the flooding, including the destruction of homes, businesses, and infrastructure. I also saw the suffering of affected communities.\n\u201cThe flood-affected people are experiencing a crisis within a crisis with the floods occurring at the height of a severe food insecurity and malnutrition crisis.\u201d\nWHO\u2019s interventions\nSimilarly, the World Health Organisation (WHO) deployed four mobile clinics to IDP camps and provided essential medicines and medical supplies, including Interagency Emergency Health Kits (IEHKs) and malaria treatments, as part of its immediate response.\nThe WHO Representative in Nigeria, Walter Mulombo, also said the agency is working to enhance the state\u2019s capacity to rapidly detect and respond to disease outbreaks within the camps\nMr Mulombo pledged the organisation\u2019s support to those affected while also expressing deep concern over the impact of the disaster on the lives of the affected population, especially the most vulnerable \u2013 women, children, and the elderly.\nHowever, he affirmed that WHO would continue to provide critical technical and operational support to mitigate the health impacts of the floods.\n\u201cWe are shocked by the scale of the disaster, but we are here to assess the needs and support both the state and federal governments in addressing the challenges posed by this sudden emergency,\u201d he said.\nFlooding caused by collapsed dam?\nThe severe flooding in Borno killed at least 30 people and affected more than one million others according to the state government.\nThe incident, multiple sources confirmed, was caused by the collapse of the Alau dam on the Ngadda River in the state on Tuesday. This is the worst flooding the state has ever experienced since the dam collapsed 30 years ago.\nPublications by media organisations and environmentalists have linked the collapse of the dam to the negligence of the state government.\nFor instance, an investigation by HumAngle showed that the state government has failed to fix the damaged parts of the dam despite several allocations for the \u201crehabilitation of the Alau Dam\u201d between 2018 and 2022 and multiple warnings from environmentalists around the region.\nThe report stated that the state government ignored the warnings and insisted that the state was not under any threat of flood as it had carried out its assessment.\nThe spokesperson of the National Emergency Management Agency, Ezekiel Manzo, put the death toll at 30. The UN also puts the total numbers of displaced persons at 414,000.\nAlso, about 300,000 people have been registered by the Emergency Operations Centre of the Borno State Government in relocation sites mainly in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC), Jere and Konduga local government areas.\nIDP camps that initially closed have been reopened to accommodate people displaced by the floods.\nThe cost of food staples and other living essentials have also skyrocketed due to the loss of several farmlands and the destruction of the city\u2019s central market.\nIn what appears to be an unfolding humanitarian disaster, many communities at least 10 states, including Jigawa, have been impacted by flood in varying degrees.\nAs of last week, Governor Usman Nnadi said Jigawa State had recovered 36 deaths as a result of floods which, he said, had displaced 15,755 persons in the state.\nSupport PREMIUM TIMES' journalism of integrity and credibility\nAt Premium Times, we firmly believe in the importance of high-quality journalism.

        "content": "title: Survivors desperate as hunger bites \n content: 'I thought I would die with my six children' - dam collapse survivor\nFatima Yakubu cannot believe that she and her six children are still alive after a dam collapsed following torrential rains in north-eastern Nigeria.\nThe family, who live south of the city of Maiduguri near the Alau Dam, were asleep when their house began filling with water in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\u201cI woke up at 1am when I felt water on my legs,\u201d the 26-year-old told the BBC.\n\u201cIt was rising very fast, and I was so scared. I thought I was going to die with my children.\u201d\nShe cried out in panic for help: \u201cSome men heard me screaming and came to rescue us. I am grateful to God.\u201d\nAlong with her children she has found refuge at Bakassi Camp, one of four centres set up for the hundreds of thousands of people who have been flooded out of their homes this week.\nUntil last year, the camp was occupied by those who had fled notorious Boko Haram Islamist militants, whose 15-year insurgency has caused havoc in a region where poverty is endemic.\nThough diminished, the jihadists are still active and despite the closure of displacement camps, Maiduguri remains densely populated with many people still preferring its relative security to rural areas of Borno state.\nThe heavier than usual rains began towards the end of August - and it is still humid and pouring with rain as people try to deal with the aftermath of the dam\u2019s collapse.\nLocals living around the Alau Dam, which is about 20km (12 miles) south of the city on the Ngadda river, became worried about the structure as the waters in the reservoir steadily rose last week - and they alerted officials.\nA delegation did go out to inspect the dam, but said there was nothing to worry about.\nHowever around four days later it started to fracture, and the dam gave way. Within three hours water was pouring into Maiduguri as people slept \u2013 with some estimates suggesting nearly half of the city was covered.\nThe authorities are still scrambling to rescue people, and sometimes bodies, trapped in buildings.\nMany public structures are affected, including hospitals and the prison.\nThe crisis has been compounded by the escape of some wild animals from the state zoo - and an estimated 40% of its animals have perished.\nThe Borno state government has ordered schools that only recently reopened after a long holiday, to close for two weeks.\nHundreds of residents can be seen walking through the knee-high floodwater along the popular Lagos Bridge, while most vehicles are unable to plough through the high volume of water.\nMothers clutch their children tightly as they wade through the streets, trying not to get swept away.\nSome young people have been taking advantage by going swimming in areas where the water is at least 4ft (1.2m) deep.\nThe waters have begun to recede in some areas, though five communities are still inundated.\nThis is Borno state's most devastating flood disaster in three decades, according to the UN and local media.\nThere are worries about an outbreak of waterborne diseases as most of the city's network of sewers has collapsed, contaminating water sources.\n\u2018\u2019The governor has announced the constitution of a special health team that will analyse the situation,\" Borno state spokesperson Abdurrahman Ahmed Bundi told the BBC. \"International partners, like the WHO [World Health Organization], have promised to support the government.\u201d\nAid agencies say at least 37 people have died - but the authorities say it is too early to confirm this estimate.\n\"We can't ascertain the figure yet. For the number of houses affected, we have to wait until the water level recedes,\" Sirajo Garba, from the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) in Maiduguri, told the BBC.\nThe state governor, Babagana Zulum, has said that the floods may have affected up to a million people.\nHunger is now a major issue for those who have lost their belongings, homes and businesses.\nAt Bakassi Camp on Wednesday evening, a car pulled up at the gate and the driver began giving out loaves of bread to the crowds gathered.\nBut dozens of people then swooped on his vehicle and snatched everything through the wound-down windows.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough food and essential supplies at the camp. People are always rushing for food,\" said Ms Yakubu, who is shouldering the responsibility for looking after her children as her husband is staying with his second wife.\n\"My kids shared just one plate of meal today. They are still hungry while I haven\u2019t eaten,\u201d she said.\nThe family all share a mat placed on the ground in the open air \u2013 no other shelter is yet available. Fighting off mosquitos, she uses her hijab to cover her one-month-old baby.\nLike many families, they are yet to be assigned sleeping areas as more tents are still being put up.\n\"My son and I have only taken kunu [a local drink made from sorghum or maize] today,\u201d 23-year-old Aisha Muhammad told the BBC in tears.\nLike many other women in the camp - finding something to eat is her main concern.\nNema said it would start distributing food soon - in additional to what the state government is doing.\nThe state spokesman explained that Governor Zulum visited the camp on Wednesday.\n\u201cHe distributed 10,000 naira [$6; \u00a35] to the head of each household as an immediate relief package while the government prepares something that\u2019s more sustainable,\u201d Mr Bundi said.\nThe four camps are currently housing around 6,000 people, according to Nema.\nBut there are thousands of others in desperate need of help - sleeping on the roads, under bridges, inside trucks and under vehicles.\nSome have made makeshift tents with whatever is to hand, but they do a poor job of shielding them from the continuous rain.\nAs the emergency services deal with the deluged city, it is unclear when the damaged Alau Dam will be fixed.\n\u2018\u2019The reconstruction of the dam is a huge project that Borno state government alone cannot take care of. It is owned by the federal government,\u2019\u2019 Mr Bundi said.\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Y\u016bsuf Ak\u00ednp\u00e8l\u00fa, Imam Saleh and Gift Ufuoma.\nYou may also be interested in:\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "content": "title: Nigerian media platforms come together to mobilise humanitarian support for Borno flood victims \n content: Media leaders in Nigeria have set up an initiative to mobilise local and international support for residents of the North-eastern state of Borno facing humanitarian crisis resulting from the severe flood in Maiduguri, Damask, and Bagga local government areas of the state.\nThe initiative, led by Kadaria Ahmed, the founder of RadioNow, brought together media leaders from PREMIUM TIMES, ThisDay, Daar Communications, Channels TV, Tozali TV, VON, Women Radio, Family Love FM, and other prominent organisations.\nIt seeks to strategise, coordinate and enhance the coverage of the flood\u2019s impact. It is also concerned with supporting affected communities, raising public awareness about the disaster and mobilising humanitarian aid for victims.\nThe Chief Adviser for Sustainable Development and Humanitarian Aid in Borno State, Mairo Mandara, made an urgent call for intervention as flood continues to wreak havoc across Maiduguri, Damasak, and Bagga.\n|\n|\nSpeaking during the virtual meeting with the media executives on Wednesday, Mrs Mandara highlighted the deteriorating conditions of displaced residents, including severe food shortages, lack of rescue vehicles, and the overcrowding of unsanitary camps.\n\u201cThe situation in Borno is bad; people are still trapped, with no access to food and a shortage of high vehicles and choppers,\u201d she said.\nShe emphasised the dire public health risks due to the poor living conditions in the camps, urging swift action to prevent a health crisis.\nIn response, media leaders across proposed several immediate measures, including the creation of a real-time WhatsApp situation room to track the flood\u2019s impact and deliver updates, in efforts to mitigate the crisis.\nThey also plan to launch unified radio and digital campaigns to solicit donations and direct the public to verified donation channels. Additionally, the group intends to leverage social media influencers to amplify the crisis using targeted hashtags.\nThe coalition also committed to framing the floods as a national emergency to attract more attention from both the federal government and international aid agencies.\nThe floods, which have submerged large portions of Maiduguri and surrounding areas, have displaced thousands. Although floodwaters have begun to recede in some areas, the need for immediate relief remains critical.\nThe media organisations involved have pledged to continue their coverage and support for the victims as the crisis unfolds.\nThe Maiduguri Flood\nMaiduguri, the capital of Borno State, is grappling with widespread flooding following the collapse of the Alau Dam, which had been at full capacity for a week, PREMIUM TIMES reported.\nOn Tuesday, the Commissioner for Information and Internal Security in Borno State, Usman Tar, issued a statement urging residents along riverbanks to evacuate immediately.\n\u201cDue to the exceptionally high water levels, we urge all residents living near the riverbanks to take immediate action to safeguard their lives and properties,\u201d said Mr Tar, a professor.\nHe added that the collapse of the Alau Dam breached another channel, causing destruction to farmlands and threatening nearby communities.\nHe urged residents to follow designated routes to ensure safe passage. The last time such a breach occurred was in 1994, which resulted in extensive flooding across Maiduguri.\nMeanwhile, the Director-General of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Barkindo Mohammed, described the situation as \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\nSome media reports indicated that floodwaters from the collapsed dam have submerged vast parts of Maiduguri, leaving thousands displaced and searching for higher ground. Heavy rainfall across the state has worsened the flooding in Biu, Chibok, Konduga, Bama, Dikwa, and Jere Local Government Areas.\nSEMA is conducting rescue operations while distributing sandbags to mitigate further damage. \u201cWe\u2019re in the field conducting rescue operations, but the situation is overwhelming,\u201d said Mr Mohammed. \u201cAt one point, we found ourselves trapped while trying to assist others.\u201d\nFederal government speaks\nPresident Tinubu on Tuesday expressed his condolences to the victims and promised federal assistance.\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, the President referred to the disaster as \u201cthe worst flood in decades\u201d and urged the immediate evacuation of residents in affected areas.\n\u201cThe flooding, triggered by the overflow of the Alau Dam, has displaced thousands and damaged key infrastructure, including the Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and the Central Post Office,\u201d the statement read.\nPresident Tinubu also directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to provide urgent assistance and pledged the Federal Government\u2019s continued support.\nREAD ALSO: Tinubu expresses concern over Borno flood, pledges support\nAlso, Vice President of Nigeria, Kashim Shettima, who spoke at the 17th Annual Banking and Finance Conference in Abuja on Tuesday, reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to addressing the crisis. \u201cAfter this conference, I will be heading to Maiduguri to oversee the response efforts,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis disaster is not limited to Borno; flooding is affecting communities across the country, from Bayelsa to Sokoto.\u201d\nMr Shettima also extended his sympathies to flood victims nationwide, assuring them that the administration would mobilise all necessary resources to provide relief.\nSupport PREMIUM TIMES' journalism of integrity and credibility\nAt Premium Times, we firmly believe in the importance of high-quality journalism.

        "title": "Two dead as floods devastate homes, infrastructure in Abuja community",
        "content": "title: Two dead as floods devastate homes, infrastructure in Abuja community \n content: The community of Agwan Hakimi, Orozo situated in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), has been left in turmoil after a devastating flood swept through the area, killing two residents and destroying vital infrastructure.\nThe flooding, which occurred on Tuesday, marked the second deluge in just five days, leaving a trail of destruction and despair among the community\u2019s inhabitants.\nIn a phone interview with PREMIUM TIMES, Chairman of the Agwan Hakimi Landlord Association, Funmilayo Patrick, confirmed the deaths of two individuals, who were swept away by the forceful waters as they attempted to cross the flood on foot. One victim, identified as Musa, was a well-known figure in the community. The identity of the second victim remains unknown. Both were buried shortly after the incident.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve experienced flooding every year for the past six years, but this is by far the worst,\u201d Mr Patrick said. \u201cWe are used to it, but losing lives has left us shaken. Homes have been submerged, destroyed, and we\u2019re terrified of what the next rainfall might bring.\u201d\n|\n|\nCommunity in crisis\nThe floods have displaced at least 10 families, leaving them with no emergency shelter. Many have found temporary refuge with neighbours or relatives, but the damage to their homes remains severe. Several buildings were flooded, and one structure collapsed under the weight of the floodwaters.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have emergency shelters,\u201d said Mr Patrick. \u201cFamilies have moved in with others, but how long can that last? It\u2019s unsustainable.\u201d\nA weak bridge\nOne of the community\u2019s primary concerns is the deteriorating state of its sole bridge, a critical connection between Agwan Hakimi and neighbouring communities like Jaina. The bridge, which serves as a vital artery for transportation, is now at risk of collapse after being battered by the back-to-back floods. Should it fall, residents fear they will be entirely cut off from essential services such as schools, churches, and markets.\n\u201cIf this bridge goes, we\u2019re stranded,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way in and out of Agwan Hakimi. We\u2019re already isolated enough. If we lose the bridge, no help will come.\u201d\nCrumbling infrastructure\nAgwan Hakimi\u2019s woes go beyond the immediate flood damage. The community has long struggled with inadequate infrastructure, particularly in terms of electricity supply. Despite efforts by the community to maintain its own electrical infrastructure, including spending nearly N10 million on transformers and replacement parts, the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) has reportedly done little to help.\n\u201cThe Landlord Association has had to fund everything ourselves,\u201d Mr Patrick said. \u201cWe\u2019ve paid for feeder pillars, conductor wires, poles, and even armoured cables for our transformers, but the AEDC has ignored our calls for support. We\u2019re paying them for services they\u2019re not delivering, and it\u2019s crippling local businesses.\u201d\nDaily power outages have left the community in disarray, with many residents filing complaints to no avail. Frustration is mounting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just the cost,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re literally paying the AEDC\u2019s staff to do their jobs. And yet, here we are, still without reliable power.\u201d\nDesperate calls for help\nThe community has now turned to the government for help. In a statement released by the Landlord Association on Wednesday, the group issued an urgent appeal to FCT Minister Nyesom Wike, AMAC Chairman Christopher Mailalangu, Senator Ireti Kingibe, and House of Representatives member Joshua Obika to intervene before the situation worsens.\n\u201cWe need immediate relief for the displaced families, repairs to the destroyed homes, and urgent action on the collapsing bridge,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWithout prompt intervention, more lives will be lost.\u201d\nThe association also called for a professional assessment of flood-prone areas in the region to mitigate future disasters. For many, the emotional and physical toll of the disaster has become unbearable.\n\u201cWe\u2019re traumatised,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time it rains, we live in fear.\u201d\nA community on the brinks\nThe flooding has laid bare the broader issues plaguing Agwan Hakimi. Roads are in disrepair, there is no local police post, and residents have been forced to organise their own security, costing them N500,000 per month. The strain on the community is evident.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything ourselves,\u201d Mr Patrick lamented. \u201cWe spent almost N2 million reinforcing the bridge last year, only for the flood to wash it away. We can\u2019t go on like this\u2014we need help, and we need it now.\u201d\nGovernment response\nFollowing inquiries from PREMIUM TIMES on Thursday, the Head of Public Affairs at the Federal Capital Territory Emergency Management Department (FEMD), Nkechi Isa, led her team to Agwan Hakimi for post assessment and profiling.\nIn a statement released on Thursday, Mrs Isa confirmed that the flood claimed one life, injured another person, and caused significant damage to homes and farmlands.\nShe attributed the disaster to a narrow culvert and poor drainage systems.\nIn response, FEMD Acting Director General, Abdulrahman Mohammed directed the AEDC to repair a power pole damaged by the floods and restore electricity to the area.\nREAD ALSO: Borno flood raises concerns over food insecurity Commission\nHe also ordered the Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD) to expand the culvert to prevent future flooding.\nHe also said FEMD is planning further assessments of the farmlands and homes affected by the flooding.\nMrs Isa said as heavy rains and possible flooding are forecast in the coming weeks, authorities have warned residents to remain vigilant and make use of emergency services, including a 112 toll-free line for reporting disasters.\nSupport PREMIUM TIMES' journalism of integrity and credibility\nAt Premium Times, we firmly believe in the importance of high-quality journalism.

        "content": "title: Nigeria signs multi-billion naira partnership agreements with UK \n content: Nigeria is to reap about N589 billion (\u00a3272.6 million) from eight partnership agreements it signed with the United Kingdom on Wednesday in Abuja.\nThe programme implementation agreements signed by the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, Abubakar Bagudu, and the UK Charge d\u2019 Affaires, Cynthia Rowe, commit both countries to collaboration in critical sectors, including governance, climate change, education, health, and the economy.\nWelcoming Ms Rowe and her team to the signing ceremony at the ministry\u2019s headquarters in Abuja, Mr Bagudu expressed appreciation for the UK government\u2019s support, saying it was a significant show of friendship.\nHe said the timing of the implementation agreement was significant given the downward trend of world economies. \u201cMany economies in the world are going through turbulent times. Nigeria and the UK are not exceptions,\u201d he stated.\n|\n|\nThe minister praised the UK\u2019s spirit of partnership, which enabled it to support other countries despite its economic challenges.\nMr Bagudu noted that some agreements would benefit more than Nigeria, explaining that they deal with global issues.\n\u201cHealth is no longer a local issue. COVID-19 reminded us that we have a shared universe. Climate is a universal phenomenon. Governance is no longer a local issue. Governance failure in one country can affect other countries through forced migration, conflict or the spread of arms,\u201d he said.\nThe minister spoke about President Bola Tinubu\u2019s administration\u2019s recent economic reforms, which he regretted had caused some discomfort among the people.\nHowever, he explained that they were part of its Renewed Hope Agenda strategies aimed at macroeconomic stability that would stimulate local and foreign investments needed for the nation\u2019s economic revival, growth, and development.\nMr Bagudu said the agreements recognised that despite the best efforts of a country, it might not have all the resources it needed to meet its developmental needs, adding that Nigeria was confident that with working partners, it would overcome its challenges.\nThe minister thanked the charge d\u2019affaires for her cooperation and assistance in ensuring the consummation of the implementation agreements, which he said were the 15th to be signed by the ministry within a month.\nMs Rowe in her statement commiserated with Nigeria over the recent flood in some states and expressed how sorry the UK was over the incident.\nShe appreciated Nigeria\u2019s long-standing cooperation and praised the Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning for being an integral partner that had shaped the relations.\nThe new implementation agreements, she said, would complement the over \u00a31 billion that had been spent on several programmes in states across the country.\n\u201cI am passionate about the UK\u2019s close relationship with Nigeria and working with the Government to advance the country\u2019s development agenda,\u201d Ms Rowe said in a short statement, adding, \u201cThe signing of these important agreements today builds on our support worth over \u00a31billion, delivering real improvements for people in health, education, governance, our work with women and girls, and helping where there is humanitarian need.\u201d\nFor decades, the implementation agency, the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO), has been actively engaged in other sectors of the country\u2019s national development, demonstrating a long-term commitment to Nigeria\u2019s growth and stability. This includes human development, the Lake Chad Basin Conflict, UK-Nigeria People-to-People links, and economic transformation.\nThe FCDO has set four clear objectives for the partnership agreements. These include delivering honest, reliable investment, providing women and girls with the freedom to succeed, stepping up life-saving support in times of crisis, and promoting sustainable economic development. These goals aim to help Nigeria attain a more stable, inclusive, resilient, healthy and prosperous polity.\nThe star agreement, with a three-year budget of N324 billion (\u00a3150 million), is the Human Assistance and Resilience Program (HARP). It aims to deliver on the integrated review of an earlier programme, \u201cForce for Good Agenda,\u201d and provide life-saving humanitarian assistance in the North-east.\nThe Nigeria Governance and Climate Change Programme (NGCP) follows it with an N84 billion (\u00a383.8 million) spending plan. It aims to support coalitions engaging with the government on areas to help resolve climate and governance problems affecting the poorest and most vulnerable Nigerians; increase state government income from internally generated revenue; mainstream climate action in the centre of state government policy, planning, and budgets; and strengthen election delivery and credibility.\nThe Strengthening Peace and Resilience in Nigeria (SPRING), which aims to reduce conflict and support Nigerian communities to better adapt to the effects of climate change, was also signed.\nREAD ALSO: NBS trade report shows Nigeria\u2019s economy improving under Tinubu \u2013 Presidency\nWith a budget of N82 billion (\u00a338 million), SPRING will support the reduction of rural violence and increased peace, security, justice and climate resilience for citizens in volatile regions of Northern Nigeria.\nOther agreements are the Equipment Support for Health Training Institutions (ESHTI) N8.3 billion (\u00a33.8 million); Climate Resilient Infrastructure for Basic Services (CRIBS) N41 billion (\u00a319 million); Building Resilience in Nigeria\u2019s Nutrition Stockpile (BRINNS) N26 billion (\u00a312 million); and Strengthening Humanitarian Access in Nigeria (SHAN) N24 billion (\u00a311 million).\nThe last of the agreements is the Manufacture Africa, which proposes to help drive the inclusive economic transformation needed to create jobs for the future by providing technical assistance to African countries to the tune of N151 billion (\u00a370 million).\nSupport PREMIUM TIMES' journalism of integrity and credibility\nAt Premium Times, we firmly believe in the importance of high-quality journalism.

        "content": "title: Why Kazakh Activists Struggle To Live Normal Lives After 'Extremism' Convictions \n content: ALMATY, Kazakstan -- Political activist Darkhan Ualiev offers a wry smile as he begins a tour of his temporary \u201cworkplace\u201d -- a disused apartment in an old building on the outskirts of Almaty that he is fixing up.\nSince he was released from jail in late 2022, he has accepted whatever work he can to feed his family. But there are plenty of constraints.\n\u201cCash, only cash!\u201d he sighs, as he explains how he depends on his friends with bank cards to pay for essential services and why he cannot work as a taxi driver -- his previous occupation.\n\u201cI am a citizen of this country, but I cannot open a bank account. I cannot go to a currency exchange and buy dollars,\u201d Ualiev told RFE/RL\u2019s Kazakh Service in an interview last month.\n\u201cMy Personal Identification Number (PIN) is blocked. I cannot get car insurance, and I certainly cannot register any property under my name.\u201d\nThe reason for these onerous restrictions?\nUaliev is viewed by Kazakhstan\u2019s government as an \u201cextremist\u201d and, as such, features on a \u201cFinancing Terrorism\u201d list that contains more than 1,400 names that can be found on the website of the country\u2019s Financial Monitoring Agency.\nThe rights watchdog Human Rights Watch released a report last month based on interviews related to more than a dozen cases similar to Ualiev\u2019s.\nAmong the report\u2019s recommendations were calls for an overhaul of the \u201coverbroad\u201d definition of extremism in Kazakh law as well as a review of how individuals are designated for inclusion on the financing terrorism list.\n\u201cIt is bad enough that people in Kazakhstan can be wrongfully prosecuted on charges related to 'extremism' or 'terrorism' simply for exercising their right to free speech, religion, or peaceful assembly, [but] they are forced to endure unjustified financial restrictions as well,\u201d wrote Mihra Rittmann, the report\u2019s author, on August 27.\nFrom Activist To 'Extremist'\nIt would be an understatement to say that Ualiev had suffered enough even before he found his way onto the \"financing terrorism\" list.\nAs historic unrest befell Kazakhstan in January 2022, he was serving a probation-like sentence for what an Almaty court determined was his membership in an organization banned as extremist by state authorities.\nThat organization was the Koshe (Street) Party, which officials ruled was merely a new version of another anti-regime movement prohibited in 2018 after it began regularly calling for nationwide anti-government demonstrations.\nActivists have repeatedly demanded to see the original Astana court judgment that condemned the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DCK) -- a group closely associated with foreign-based opposition politician Mukhtar Ablyazov -- but officials have never heeded the request.\nResolutions passed by the European Parliament demanding improvements in Kazakhstan\u2019s human rights and governance environment, in turn, refer to both DCK and the Koshe Party as \u201cpeaceful\u201d opposition movements.\nWhen he realized that the 2022 unrest that began in western Kazakhstan over a fuel price increase had reached Almaty, Ualiev said he decided to violate a provision of his sentence that barred him from political activity and join the January protests.\nBy January 5, 2022, the demonstrations were giving way to violent clashes and looting, but there is no evidence that Ualiev engaged in any violence.\nHis older brother, though, was a victim of it.\nAslan Ualiev was shot dead during the events that killed at least 238 people.\nAfter being unable to reach his brother for several days following the peak of the crisis, Ualiev and other relatives began to scour the city\u2019s morgues.\nAnd it was while searching for Aslan that he was arrested by police, who he claims tortured him before he began a nearly yearlong stint behind bars.\nHe received confirmation of his brother\u2019s death only after his arrest, while his lawyer, Zhanara Balgabaeva, said the evidence of mistreatment of her client was \u201cclear\u201d when she was finally able to meet with him.\nMore than 30 police officers and secret services staff have been handed custodial and other sentences for mistreating detainees during the events many Kazakhs refer to as Bloody January, authorities say. Other cases are still in motion.\nBut rights groups argue that these figures do not capture the truly systemic nature of the abuses committed by the state during the month that rocked Kazakhstan.\n'Abusing' Laws On Combating Terrorism, Money Laundering\nThe space for political activism in Kazakhstan hasn\u2019t increased since the crisis, as many hoped.\nIf anything, there is even less evidence that a law on public assemblies passed earlier in President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev\u2019s tenure has had any real bearing on political freedom in the country.\nIn a September 3 national address, Toqaev condemned \u201cirresponsible, exalted populists who do not have deep knowledge of the issues discussed in society,\u201d adding that such figures have \u201cnothing to do with democracy.\u201d\nBut the restrictions faced by the activists profiled in HRW's report would appear to have even less to do with it, especially given the nonviolent nature of their \"crimes.\"\nAccording to the group, the nearly 20 cases examined for the report all stemmed from prosecution on three charges: \u201corganizing or participating in the activities of a public or religious association\u201d banned as extremist by a court; \u201cinciting social, ethnic, tribal, racial, class or religious discord\u201d; and \u201cterrorism propaganda or public calls to commit an act of terrorism.\u201d\nData provided by the Foreign Affairs Ministry to Human Rights Watch in the first half of the year suggested that nearly half of all the citizens on the \"financing terrorism\" list had been prosecuted on one of these charges.\nRFE/RL\u2019s Kazakh Service, which regularly monitors the plight of opposition activists, has in the past covered the attempts of citizens convicted of \u201cextremist\u201d crimes to appeal against the economic straitjacket that comes with being on the notorious list.\nBut HRW notes that the restrictions are automatic for anyone whose conviction falls under this umbrella, thanks to Article 12 of a 2009 money-laundering law.\nIndividuals on the \"financing terrorism\" list can remain on it for as long as they have a criminal record, although they have the right to petition authorities for removal if they have served their sentence, the group said.\nInterviewed by RFE/RL\u2019s Kazakh Service on the ramifications of HRW\u2019s report, veteran rights defender Yevgeny Zhovtis said he did not expect \u201cany particular reaction\u201d to the report from officials, who he said have \u201cbecome accustomed to\u201d ignoring rights organizations.\n\u201cBut there is also the UN Security Council Counterterrorism Committee. There is a [UN] special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism; there is a group of measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, called FATF,\u201d he said.\n\u201cKazakhstan has been strongly criticized by all these organizations for the fact that [the government], to put it mildly, abuses these laws on combating terrorism and money laundering.... The reaction [of these organizations] can have some weight for the authorities of Kazakhstan.\u201d",

Agbakwuru, Ndahi Marama & Omeiza Ajayi\nMaiduguri\u2014Following the devastating flooding that is ravaging parts of Maiduguri metropolis, Borno State, since Monday night, Vanguard observed that crocodiles, snakes, and other dangerous animals have taken over the affected areas, especially Post Office and Monday Market general area, which is located near the Shehu Kyarimi Park (Zoo).\nIt was also gathered that, apart from the Shehu\u2019s palace, some parts of University of Maiduguri and its Teaching Hospital, Gwange, Moromoro, State Lowcost, 500 Abbagana housing estate, popular Monday Market, Lagos Streets, NUJ Centre, Government House are also submerged, leaving millions of people displaced with property worth billions of naira destroyed.\nAt press time, thousands of people were sighted evacuating few of their belongings to a safer areas such as Bulumkutu, Gomari Airport, Tashan Baga among others, as victims cry for government to come to their aide.\nThis came as President Bola Tinubu called for the immediate evacuation of residents of parts of Maiduguri overtaken by floods, pledging Federal Government support.\nMeanwhile, Vice President Kashim Shettima, who was on an on-the-spot assessment of the ravaging floods, in Maiduguri, said despite preparations, the severity of the floods in Maiduguri was most catastrophic in over three decades in the state capital.\nFormer President Muhammadu Buhari, while described the recent flood that caused havoc in Borno and other parts of the country as a national calamity.\nAlso, former Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso of Kano State, has called on the Federal Government to urgently intervene in the devastating floods that have ravaged Maiduguri.\nVanguard gathered that many lives were lost in the ongoing flooding.\nUnfortunately, the incident is taking place when Governor Babagana Zulum of the state was out of the country, while his Deputy, Umar Kadafur is also out on his annual leave.\nThe Police Public Relations Officer of the Borno Command, Kenneth Daso, have since alerted the general public to be vigilante as the police and other relevant stakeholders were doing everything possible to safeguard lives and property in this trying moment.\nTinubu orders evacuation of affected communes, pledges FG\u2019s support\nTinubu, who expressed concern over the flooding in parts of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, directed the relevant government agencies to expedite rescue efforts.\n\u201cWhile the relevant authorities are still assessing the damage caused by the flood, the President calls for the immediate evacuation of people from the affected areas,\u201d read a statement by the President\u2019s Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, Mr. Bayo Onanuga.\nOnanuga said, \u201cPresident Tinubu extends his heartfelt condolences to the government and people of the state, especially to the families that have lost their means of livelihood due to the disaster triggered by the overflow of the Alau Dam.\n\u201cPresident Tinubu assures Governor Babagana Zulum that the Federal Government is ready to collaborate to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the affected people.\n\u201cHe has ordered the National Emergency Management Agency to assist the flood victims.\u201d\nFloods most catastrophic in 3 decades -Shettima\nVice President Shettima said the impacts of the floods exceeded estimation, but assured that the Federal Government would prioritise the welfare of the affected communities.\nHe said: \u201cThe flood\u2019s unprecedented scale has presented challenges beyond our previous experiences.\n\u201cThe disaster serves as a sobering reminder of the increasing threats posed by climate change, not just globally, but particularly to North East regions.\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s vulnerability to flood disasters has been highlighted time and again, as witnessed during the devastating floods of 2012, 2018, and 2022.\n\u201cThe factors contributing to these recurring disasters are diverse, and it is for this reason that Tinubu has developed a comprehensive roadmap to address these challenges headlong.\n\u201cNonetheless, the Federal Government remains determined in its commitment,\u201d he said.\nShettima said, as with other states facing similar crises, the government was resolute in mobilising all necessary resources to ensure the safety and support of affected persons.\nShettima, who commiserated with victims of the flood disaster, expressed the deepest sympathies of Tinubu to the victims.\nBorno flood, national calamity \u2014Buhari\nA statement by Mallam Garba Shehu in Abuja, yesterday, said: \u201cFormer President Buhari sends commiserations to the government and people of Borno and the other states, following severe floods caused by incessant downpour, describing it as a national calamity.\n\u201cThe former president said he had heard of the widespread devastation of homes, farmland, and the loss of life in Borno and several other states of the federation, and expressed his hope that the relief measures by the various governments would provide comfort and help people who had lost their family members and livelihood to resume their normal lives.\n\u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this natural disaster.\u201d\nKwankwanso seeks FG intervention as floods ravage Maiduguri\nKwankwaso in a statement posted on the X platform, yesterday, said: \u201cI have seen horrifying images from Maiduguri, where many parts of the city are submerged by water. I appeal to the authorities and those who can help to render all necessary assistance to safeguard the people and their communities.\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the government and people of Borno State at this difficult time.\u201d\nFG moves to evacuate inmates from flooded Maiduguri prison\nMeanwhile, the Federal Government said it had taken steps to ensure a \u201csecure transfer\u201d of inmates from the flooded Medium Security Custodial Centre in Maiduguri, Borno State.\nSpokesman of the Nigerian Prisons, Abubakar Umarin a statement, yesterday, said: \u201cThe Nigerian Prison is working tirelessly to address the devastating impact of the recent flooding on our facilities in Maiduguri, particularly the Medium Security Custodial Centre.\n\u201cThe unfortunate incident is a natural disaster caused by the overflow and collapse of the Alau Dam in Konduga Local Government Area of the state.\n\u201cAs the agency responsible for the safekeeping of inmates, we want to assure the public that we are taking all necessary measures to ensure public safety. Evacuate inmates to a safer facility, ensure smooth operations, collaborate with sister security and relevant agencies in providing support and assistance to those affected.\n\u201cContrary to initial reports, the officers and men of the command are working around the clock to ensure a smooth and secure transfer process.\n\u201cWe appreciate the support and guidance from the Presidency and the Vice President\u2019s visit to Maiduguri to assess the situation.\n\u201cWe will continue to provide updates, and will like to assure the public that the prison is committed to maintaining order and ensuring public safety during this challenging time.\u201d",

        "content": "title: Nigeria - Protecting the Vulnerable On the Path to Progress \n content: Abuja, Nigeria \u2014 Returning to Nigeria after five years, I was struck by the changes - both the challenges and the opportunities. To better understand these dynamics, I have been undertaking visits to states across Nigeria.\nIn Lagos, I saw young people using technology to drive innovation and address social issues. In Enugu and Anambra, I witnessed the transformative power of innovation in education and healthcare, and the critical role of traditional leaders in promoting sustainable development. In the Northwest, I met with seven state governors eager to collaborate with the UN on issues ranging from insecurity to climate change.\nThe economic landscape has shifted dramatically, with the currency depreciation impacting everyone, but especially the most vulnerable. The new government, just over one year in office, has initiated needed economic reforms intended to improve the macro-economic space and the governance of the country's resources.\nAs the reforms are yet to produce results, we are observing unintended consequences such as high cost of goods and services, mostly food, fuel and transport, resulting in hardship for the people, especially the poorest - as the cost of living has skyrocketed.\nThe UN needs to engage differently to make an impact in Nigeria and adapt our work to align with the development aspirations of the country. As I took on the role of the Resident Coordinator (RC), five months ago, I prioritized high-level engagement with government partners to demonstrate our support and offer the UN's convening power and resources.\nWe are committed to helping Nigeria build a new narrative, with the leaders of Nigeria in the driver's seat, one focused on opportunities and hope for the future, particularly for its young people.\nEconomic reforms with a human face\nWhile the government's economic reforms are essential, they must also protect the most vulnerable. The UN in Nigeria is supporting the implementation of a robust social safety net, and the Resident Coordinator's Office (RCO) plays a critical role in streamlining these efforts. For instance, while UN Children'd Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) might both be working on aspects of implementing social transfers, the RCO brings them together to ensure coordination, avoid duplication, and maximize the use of resources.\nThe RCO also fosters vital partnerships, such as with the Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning; the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs); Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Federal Ministry of Youth Development; National Human Rights Commission (NHRC); and the Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution (IPCR), among others; to leverage national capacities and ensure the sustainability of our initiatives.\nIn the current resource-constrained environment of international development, it is imperative that we harness the collective strengths of UN agencies. By working together, we can more effectively address the multifaceted challenges facing Nigeria and ensure that the most vulnerable are protected during this period of economic transition.\nThe UN in Nigeria continues to offer assistance with vulnerability assessments, building a strong beneficiary registry system, and reinforcing the distribution of cash transfers to millions of households, particularly targeting women, youth, and persons with disabilities. The RCO plays a vital role in ensuring these efforts are well-coordinated and impactful.\nWe bring together the expertise of various UN agencies, leveraging UNICEF's, WFP's and International Labour Organization's (ILO) experience in areas such as improving policy, data collection, social registry, vulnerability assessments, communication, and monitoring - this collaboration guarantees effectiveness and efficiency. We also work with external partners like the World Bank and the European Union through the Social Protection Development Partners' Group to leverage their knowledge and resources.\nAdditionally, we hope to support urgent acceleration in social transfers and more systemic improvement, drawing on the technical capabilities of agencies like UNICEF, WFP, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), ILO, and International Organization for Migration (IOM) to better target the poorest populations.\nThe RCO also facilitates partnerships with government agencies such as the Federal Ministry of Finance, Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, National Bureau of Statistics, to build a strong registry system using innovations like biometric technology, enhancing effective monitoring, and ensuring all vulnerable groups are reached.\nGiven the importance of building trust around the current economic reforms, the UN Information Centre, under the guidance of the RC, has offered a country-wide and robust communication and advocacy strategy hinged on a multi-channel approach to reach everyone. The effort has included important partnerships with telecommunications companies, media, private sector, community service organizations, among others.\nDealing with displacement\nThe Northeast, grappling with a protracted humanitarian crisis, has understandably the strongest UN presence in Nigeria. Here, the RCO plays a critical role in coordinating the diverse efforts of UN agencies, NGOs, and the government to address the complex needs of internally displaced people (IDPs) and find lasting solutions.\nUnder the leadership of the RC, the UN Country Team in Nigeria has actively championed the Secretary-General's Action Agenda on Internal Displacement. Nigeria, out of the 15 countries with the highest number of displaced people globally, is the most advanced in planning for durable solutions.\nThis led to the recent launch, of government plans placing over 4 million IDPs and returnees on pathways to solutions. By fostering collaboration and strategic planning, the RCO has been instrumental in supporting this government effort.\nCollaboration to accelerate the SDGs\nThe Secretary-General's recent SDG Report underscores the global shortfall in progress. Nigeria, currently ranked 146th out of 167 countries, needs urgent action to accelerate progress towards the Goals.\nWhile there are improvements in health (SDG 3) and water and sanitation (SDG 6), progress is insufficient to achieve the targets on time. Given its demographic size and influence in Africa, success in Nigeria can have a ripple effect across the continent.\nTherefore, it is time for an end to business as usual. We must embrace a new era of collaboration, one that harnesses the power of innovation, optimizes scarce resources, and fosters stronger partnerships. Through intensified advocacy and coordinated efforts with the international community, civil society, the private sector, and government, we can unlock Nigeria's vast potential and accelerate progress towards the SDGs.\nThe time for transformative change is now, and together, we can build a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future for Nigeria.\nThis blog was written by Mohamed M. Malick Fall, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nigeria.

        "content": "title: Nigeria: Humanitarian Crisis Looms As Flood Ravages Borno \n content: A humanitarian crisis is looming in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, after flood ravaged a large part of the metropolis, leaving thousands of residents trapped.\nLEADERSHIP gathered from officials that scores have been killed as a result of the flood, while prisoners have also escaped.\nIt was also gathered that graveyards had been submerged while dangerous animals had crept into the communities, of which about 75 per cent had been taken over by water.\nThe Shehu of Borno's palace, the state Secretariat, Customs, the State Specialist Hospital, UNIMAID, and Gwange areas have been submerged by floodwaters following the collapse of the Alau Dam in the Konduga local government area of Borno State.\nMillionaires' Quarters around Gamboru Ward and its environs are consumed. The famous Lagos bridge, which was taken over by the flood, has also been blocked, as has the Moduganari bypass bridge, which has also been submerged.\nThe Zoo Road was also flooded, with water gushing into the College of Health Technology Maiduguri, where students had already been relocated to the School of Nursing. The water also flowed towards the Commissioner of Police junction via Damboa Road.\nThe popular Maiduguri Zoo, Shehu Sanda Kyarimi Park, was also submerged in the early hours of the night, forcing staff to relocate to a safe place. Many animals in the zoo, including snakes and crocodiles, have strayed through the water channels, raising apprehension among residents who are scrambling to remove their properties floating on the raging flood.\nThe situation was so dire that it was worse than the previous one of 1994, exactly 30 years ago.\nMeanwhile, Comrade Bulama Abiso, the executive director of the Network of Civil Society Organisations in Borno State, has called for humanitarian support for the flood victims.\nAbiso noted that the flooding has left numerous families devastated and homeless, with a particularly severe impact on women and children. He further called on all Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and Community-based Organisations (CBOs) under its wing to assist the affected communities.\nIn the meantime, the Borno State government has reopened the closed Bakassi Internally Displaced Persons camp in Maiduguri for the relocation of citizens displaced by the flood.\n...Zoo Animals Dead\nAbout 80 per cent of animals in the famous Sanda Kyari Zoo in Maiduguri have been pronounced dead, and a lot of properties destroyed following the flooding that erupted on Monday night as a result of the collapse of the Alau Dam in the Konduga local government area.\nA statement issued in Maiduguri on Tuesday by the zoo's general manager, Ali Abacha, disclosed that deadly animals such as crocodiles and snakes had been washed away into the communities; hence, he called on communities to take necessary precautions to avoid the animals.\nMeanwhile, the University of Maiduguri and Borno State University have been shut down due to the raging flood that struck Maiduguri. Many communities have been overtaken, and residents have fled.\nA statement issued on Tuesday in Maiduguri by the acting senior assistant registrar II of BOSU, Fatima Muhammad Audu, said the institution had to comply with the circular of the Borno State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and Innovation to close the University from Tuesday, 10th September, to Monday, 16th September, 2024.\nSimilarly, the University of Maiduguri has announced a temporary suspension of lectures and closure of offices until the flood subsides in Maiduguri.\nThis was contained in a statement issued on Tuesday in Maiduguri by the university's registrar, Ahmed Lawan, which our correspondent obtained.\nIn a related development, the Borno State government, through the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and Innovation, has directed the statewide closure of all schools, both public and private, until Monday, 23rd September 2024.\nThe closure was contained in a statement issued in Maiduguri by the acting director of schools services, Grema Bulama, on behalf of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Education, obtained by LEADERSHIP.\n...Tinubu Orders Evacuation\nPresident Bola Tinubu has expressed deep concern about the flooding in parts of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State.\nSeen as the worst in recent decades, the flood has displaced thousands of residents and affected facilities such as the Post Office and the Maiduguri Teaching Hospital.\nOver 200 Inmates Escape As Flood Submerges Borno Prison\nNo fewer than 200 prisoners escaped on Tuesday following the severe flood that submerged the Nigeria Correctional Service in Maiduguri, resulting in a jailbreak.\nSources said the flooding has caused extensive damage to the prison facility, adding that the raging flood has breached security barriers and weakened structural supports, allowing the over 200 inmates to break free from their confinement.\nSources revealed that the Maiduguri New Prison, which is situated along Abaganaran area of the metropolis, is hosting inmates such as the embattled lawyer and humanitarian, Aisha Wakil, known as Mama Boko Haram, who is serving her jail term in the prison over issues bordering on fraud and obtaining by pretence.\nAuthorities have confirmed that the escapees are considered highly dangerous and may be armed, heightening the threat to public safety.\nHowever, a manhunt is said to be underway to locate and recapture the escaped inmates, with law enforcement agencies mobilising additional resources.\nWhen contacted to confirm the situation at the prison, the public relations officer of the NCS in Maiduguri, which comprises the New Prison and Maiduguri Maximum Prison, Mr Bala Adamu, said he was having a meeting on the phone with the national PRO and would get back after that, but did not return the call at the time of filing this report.\nPresident Tinubu, in a statement by his spokesman, Bayo Onanuga, extended his heartfelt condolences to the government and people of the state, especially to the families that have lost their means of livelihood due to the disaster triggered by the overflow of the Alau Dam.\nWhile relevant authorities are still assessing the damage wrought by the flood, the president called for the immediate evacuation of people from affected areas.\nPresident Tinubu assured Governor Babagana Umara Zulum that the federal government wa ready to collaborate to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the affected people.\nHe ordered the National Emergency Management Agency to assist the flood victims.\n...Nigeria To Intensify Flood Mitigation - Shettima\nVice President Kashim Shettima has assured that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's administration will tackle the challenges of floods in Nigeria.\nThe Vice President, who gave the assurance in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, on Tuesday, noted that though the factors leading to the ravaging flood and other recurring disasters in the country are diverse, President Tinubu has already developed a comprehensive roadmap aimed at addressing these challenges head-on.\nThe Shettima is in Maiduguri for an on-the-spot assessment of the ravaging floods that have displaced communities in the state.\nCommiserating with the victims of the flood disaster, he said that President Tinubu not only expressed his \"deepest sympathies\" but had also assured that the federal government will prioritise the welfare of the affected communities.\nIt's a National Calamity - Buhari\nFormer President Muhammadu Buhari has sent his commiserations to the government and people of Borno and other states following severe floods caused by incessant downpours, describing the situation as a national calamity.\nThe former President said he had heard of the widespread devastation of homes and farmland and the loss of life in Borno and several other states of the federation, describing it as a national calamity.\nBuhari expressed his hope that the relief measures taken by the various governments would provide comfort and help those who had lost their family members and livelihoods to resume their everyday lives.",

        "content": "title: Nigeria Faces Humanitarian Crisis As Floods Ravage Communities, Farmlands \n content: The situation threatens a new wave of humanitarian crises in a country facing increasing hardships amidst fears that 26.5 million Nigerians face food insecurity this year, up from 18.6 million people last year, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nNigeria faces a looming humanitarian crisis as massive floods submerge communities and farmlands across the country.\nAt least 10 states have experienced massive flooding this year, displacing close to 500,000 residents.\nAccording to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the floods destroyed more than 16,000 hectares of farmlands. Farmers in some communities are now being forced to harvest their farm produce prematurely over fears of destruction by imminent floods.\nIn Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, North-east Nigeria, overflowing riverbanks and the collapse of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River have opened floodgates in the city. Buildings are now submerged, and more than 239,000 residents have been displaced, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Authorities are scampering to evacuate inmates from one affected prison. Animals in the zoo have been let loose by the floods, causing panic among residents.\nAn aerial view of the city reminds one of Nigeria's massive flooding of 2022. Described as the worst in a decade, it displaced more than 1.4 million people in 34 of the country's 36 states.\nAlthough this year's flood did not cause the same scale of destruction, it raised similar systemic issues in Nigeria's flood management and emergency preparedness.\nThe development also threatens a new wave of humanitarian crises in a country facing increasing hardship amidst fears that 26.5 million Nigerians face food insecurity this year, up from 18.6 million people last year, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nThere were warnings\nThe 2024 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO), launched in April, predicted high floods in 148 local government areas (LGAs) in 31 states, including Borno. The report, produced by Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), also said 249 LGAs in 35 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are within moderate flood risk areas.\nThe report listed the high flood-prone states as Adamawa, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue and Borno. Others are Cross-River, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Imo, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Rivers, Sokoto, Taraba, and Yobe.\n\"These regions are characterised by erratic rainfall patterns, river basin dynamics and inadequate hydraulic infrastructures, amplifying the potential for devastating flood impacts on communities, agriculture and infrastructures,\" the report stated.\nThe AFO recommended implementing robust early warning systems to provide timely alerts to at-risk communities and enable proactive evacuation and response efforts.\nIt also recommended infrastructure improvements, such as flood defences, drainage systems, and embankments, to mitigate flood risk and protect vulnerable areas.\nIt added: \"Strengthening institutional capacity at all levels of government to effectively coordinate flood response and recovery efforts, including disaster risk management, emergency response and post-disaster recovery planning.\"\nNEMA prepares\nThe spokesperson for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Manzo Ezekiel, told PREMIUM TIMES on Wednesday that the agency had sent alarms to stakeholders, including state governors, since the beginning of the year, asking them to prepare for the floods.\nHe said the agency also met with the stakeholders to analyse the flood forecast and the roles to play towards mitigating the occurrence. He noted that the agency also placed several jingles on the radio, directing residents of flood-prone and riverine areas to be on the lookout.\n\"NEMA wrote to all the state governors. And we didn't stop at that. NEMA convened stakeholder meetings where the forecast was discussed, and the mitigating side was discussed. Then NEMA also embarked on advocacy to the stakeholders,\" he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.\nFloods ravage communities, destroy farmlands\nThe flood in Borno, exacerbated by the collapse of the Alau dam, has garnered the most attention and has been described as the worst that the state experienced in over three decades.\nHowever, at least 10 other states listed in the AFO report have witnessed flooding that killed people and destroyed properties in the last two months.\nLast month, at least 39 people lost their lives to massive floods that swept through part of Jigawa State. According to the Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Haruna Mairiga, more than 15,000 people were displaced and 8,500 houses were affected by the floods. Mr Mairiga added that 12,000 hectares of farmlands were washed away.\nIn Adamawa State, at least six persons were reported dead in August as a result of the flooding that displaced more than 12,961 persons in three LGAs, namely Madagali, Demsa, and Numan.\nIn Gombe and Yobe states, more than 4,000 houses and farmlands have been destroyed by flood. While Gombe SEMA said 2,517 houses and shops were destroyed by a flood that ravaged 33 communities, the Yobe SEMA stated that 1,650 houses were destroyed in Jajere and Yunusari towns of the state.\nIn Kaduna, close to 4,000 people have been displaced by flooding. More than 200 houses were submerged in Zaria and Sabon-Gari LGAs of Kaduna State. In Kafanchan and surrounding villages in Jema'a LGA of the state, floods displaced more than 1,000 residents and killed two children. In Zango Kataf LGA, NEMA said the flood had displaced no fewer than 3,633 people from five communities.\nIn Kano, the Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Isyaku Kubarachi, said the recent flood killed 31 people and displaced 31,818.\nHe said the floods destroyed 2,518 farmlands, covering 976 hectares of land in 21 local government areas in the state, and 5,280 houses.\nThe Executive Secretary of Zamfara State SEMA, Ahmed Bala, said the flood affected 9,784 households in all 12 political wards in Gummi LGA of the state. He added that 12 people lost their lives while hundreds of hectares of farmlands were washed away.\nIn Bauchi, the state SEMA said more than N7.81 billion worth of farmlands and properties have been destroyed by flood in 16 LGAs.\nThe agency's Director of planning, Research, and Statistics, Adamu Nayola, attributed the flood to two months of heavy downpours in the northern part of the state.\n\"The floods, which affected communities in 16 hard-hit LGAs, destroyed and damaged houses, farmlands, roads, electricity poles, and domestic animals. This resulted in significant economic losses,\" he said.\nHe listed affected LGAs as Giade, Shira, Katagum, Gamawa, Zaki, Kirfi, Dambam, Alkaleri, Darazo, Itas Gadau, Toro, Bauchi, Misau, Jama'are, Warji and Ganjuwa.\nPremature harvest\nIn Anambra and Bayelsa states, panicky farmers are prematurely harvesting crops over fear of an impending flood disaster that could destroy them if left unharvested.\nAccording to Paul Odenigbo, the Executive Secretary of Anambra SEMA, many community farmlands had already been submerged due to increased water levels.\nLooming humanitarian crises\nNEMA announced last month that more than 16,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed in 27 states. With the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation's warning that an estimated 26.5 million people would face food insecurity in Nigeria this year, the situation threatens to become dire.\nNEMA has also warned that the overflowing rivers are reaching other communities. The agency has placed other states, such as Benue, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Imo, Rivers, and Bayelsa, on alert.\nWith the flood in Maiduguri, Mr Ezekiel said NEMA has deployed some of the facilities used in Jigawa to Maiduguri. He listed them as including life jackets, rescue boats, spreaders and cutters, and a mobile water treatment plant.\n\"As I speak to you now, since Jigawa has stabilised with the situation in Maiduguri, our facilities have been moved to Maiduguri to support the ongoing rescue operations that are ongoing there now,\" he added.\nHe, therefore, called for preparedness in the central and southern states, noting that the \"water will naturally flow downward.\"",

        "content": "title: Nigeria faces humanitarian crisis as floods ravage communities, farmlands \n content: Nigeria faces a looming humanitarian crisis as massive floods submerge communities and farmlands across the country.\nAt least 10 states have experienced massive flooding this year, displacing close to 500,000 residents.\nAccording to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the floods destroyed more than 16,000 hectares of farmlands. Farmers in some communities are now being forced to harvest their farm produce prematurely over fears of destruction by imminent floods.\nIn Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, North-east Nigeria, overflowing riverbanks and the collapse of the Alau Dam on the Ngadda River have opened floodgates in the city. Buildings are now submerged, and more than 239,000 residents have been displaced, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Authorities are scampering to evacuate inmates from one affected prison. Animals in the zoo have been let loose by the floods, causing panic among residents.\n|\n|\nAn aerial view of the city reminds one of Nigeria\u2019s massive flooding of 2022. Described as the worst in a decade, it displaced more than 1.4 million people in 34 of the country\u2019s 36 states.\nAlthough this year\u2019s flood did not cause the same scale of destruction, it raised similar systemic issues in Nigeria\u2019s flood management and emergency preparedness.\nThe development also threatens a new wave of humanitarian crises in a country facing increasing hardship amidst fears that 26.5 million Nigerians face food insecurity this year, up from 18.6 million people last year, according to the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nThere were warnings\nThe 2024 Annual Flood Outlook (AFO), launched in April, predicted high floods in 148 local government areas (LGAs) in 31 states, including Borno. The report, produced by Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA), also said 249 LGAs in 35 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are within moderate flood risk areas.\nThe report listed the high flood-prone states as Adamawa, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue and Borno. Others are Cross-River, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Imo, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Rivers, Sokoto, Taraba, and Yobe.\n\u201cThese regions are characterised by erratic rainfall patterns, river basin dynamics and inadequate hydraulic infrastructures, amplifying the potential for devastating flood impacts on communities, agriculture and infrastructures,\u201d the report stated.\nThe AFO recommended implementing robust early warning systems to provide timely alerts to at-risk communities and enable proactive evacuation and response efforts.\nIt also recommended infrastructure improvements, such as flood defences, drainage systems, and embankments, to mitigate flood risk and protect vulnerable areas.\nIt added: \u201cStrengthening institutional capacity at all levels of government to effectively coordinate flood response and recovery efforts, including disaster risk management, emergency response and post-disaster recovery planning.\u201d\nNEMA prepares\nThe spokesperson for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Manzo Ezekiel, told PREMIUM TIMES on Wednesday that the agency had sent alarms to stakeholders, including state governors, since the beginning of the year, asking them to prepare for the floods.\nHe said the agency also met with the stakeholders to analyse the flood forecast and the roles to play towards mitigating the occurrence. He noted that the agency also placed several jingles on the radio, directing residents of flood-prone and riverine areas to be on the lookout.\n\u201cNEMA wrote to all the state governors. And we didn\u2019t stop at that. NEMA convened stakeholder meetings where the forecast was discussed, and the mitigating side was discussed. Then NEMA also embarked on advocacy to the stakeholders,\u201d he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.\nFloods ravage communities, destroy farmlands\nThe flood in Borno, exacerbated by the collapse of the Alau dam, has garnered the most attention and has been described as the worst that the state experienced in over three decades.\nHowever, at least 10 other states listed in the AFO report have witnessed flooding that killed people and destroyed properties in the last two months.\nLast month, at least 39 people lost their lives to massive floods that swept through part of Jigawa State. According to the Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Haruna Mairiga, more than 15,000 people were displaced and 8,500 houses were affected by the floods. Mr Mairiga added that 12,000 hectares of farmlands were washed away.\nIn Adamawa State, at least six persons were reported dead in August as a result of the flooding that displaced more than 12,961 persons in three LGAs, namely Madagali, Demsa, and Numan.\nIn Gombe and Yobe states, more than 4,000 houses and farmlands have been destroyed by flood. While Gombe SEMA said 2,517 houses and shops were destroyed by a flood that ravaged 33 communities, the Yobe SEMA stated that 1,650 houses were destroyed in Jajere and Yunusari towns of the state.\nIn Kaduna, close to 4,000 people have been displaced by flooding. More than 200 houses were submerged in Zaria and Sabon-Gari LGAs of Kaduna State. In Kafanchan and surrounding villages in Jema\u2019a LGA of the state, floods displaced more than 1,000 residents and killed two children. In Zango Kataf LGA, NEMA said the flood had displaced no fewer than 3,633 people from five communities.\nIn Kano, the Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Isyaku Kubarachi, said the recent flood killed 31 people and displaced 31,818.\nHe said the floods destroyed 2,518 farmlands, covering 976 hectares of land in 21 local government areas in the state, and 5,280 houses.\nThe Executive Secretary of Zamfara State SEMA, Ahmed Bala, said the flood affected 9,784 households in all 12 political wards in Gummi LGA of the state. He added that 12 people lost their lives while hundreds of hectares of farmlands were washed away.\nIn Bauchi, the state SEMA said more than N7.81 billion worth of farmlands and properties have been destroyed by flood in 16 LGAs.\nThe agency\u2019s Director of planning, Research, and Statistics, Adamu Nayola, attributed the flood to two months of heavy downpours in the northern part of the state.\n\u201cThe floods, which affected communities in 16 hard-hit LGAs, destroyed and damaged houses, farmlands, roads, electricity poles, and domestic animals. This resulted in significant economic losses,\u201d he said.\nHe listed affected LGAs as Giade, Shira, Katagum, Gamawa, Zaki, Kirfi, Dambam, Alkaleri, Darazo, Itas Gadau, Toro, Bauchi, Misau, Jama\u2019are, Warji and Ganjuwa.\nPremature harvest\nIn Anambra and Bayelsa states, panicky farmers are prematurely harvesting crops over fear of an impending flood disaster that could destroy them if left unharvested.\nAccording to Paul Odenigbo, the Executive Secretary of Anambra SEMA, many community farmlands had already been submerged due to increased water levels.\nLooming humanitarian crises\nNEMA announced last month that more than 16,000 hectares of farmlands have been destroyed in 27 states. With the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s warning that an estimated 26.5 million people would face food insecurity in Nigeria this year, the situation threatens to become dire.\nNEMA has also warned that the overflowing rivers are reaching other communities. The agency has placed other states, such as Benue, Kogi, Anambra, Delta, Imo, Rivers, and Bayelsa, on alert.\nWith the flood in Maiduguri, Mr Ezekiel said NEMA has deployed some of the facilities used in Jigawa to Maiduguri. He listed them as including life jackets, rescue boats, spreaders and cutters, and a mobile water treatment plant.\n\u201cAs I speak to you now, since Jigawa has stabilised with the situation in Maiduguri, our facilities have been moved to Maiduguri to support the ongoing rescue operations that are ongoing there now,\u201d he added.\nHe, therefore, called for preparedness in the central and southern states, noting that the \u201cwater will naturally flow downward.\u201d\nSupport PREMIUM TIMES' journalism of integrity and credibility\nAt Premium Times, we firmly believe in the importance of high-quality journalism.

        "content": "title: Nigeria: Shettima Visits Victims, Says Tragedy Beyond Borno Govt \n content: Vice President Kashim Shettima has visited the flood victims in Maiduguri metropolis and Jere, and announced that 50 trucks of rice were underway to the state for distribution.\nThe vice president, who stated this at the palace of the Shehu of Borno, said the visit was at the instance of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\"The president has given assurance that the federal government would stand firmly behind Borno State toward ameliorating the pitiable condition of our people.\n\"We are talking to the organised private sector to further reinforce the efforts of Borno State because honestly, Your Eminence, the tragedy that we have seen is way beyond the capacity of Borno State alone to shoulder.\n\"Be rest assured that, Insha Allah, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is determined to support the governor to address the needs of the people\", he said.\nVP Shettima assured Nigerians that the government was working hard to address all challenges confronting the nation.\n\"The problem of flood is not peculiar to one part of the country; we are facing these challenges right from Bayelsa to Sokoto. Be rest assured that the president has the nation at heart and he will do whatever it takes to salvage the state of affairs,\" he said.\nIn his response, the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Umar Garba Al Amin El-Kanemi, said the flood was an act of God, but that the government should invite experts to advise on what to do to avoid a repeat.\n\"It is history repeating itself. Exactly in September 1994, same incident like this happened, and people seriously suffered and now another one after 30 years.\n\"But, this one is worse than the one we witnessed in 1994. Your Excellency, my appeal is that, something has to be done by inviting professionals to advise the government appropriately so that our people would not suffer again.\nHe appreciated the vice president for the visit and described the situation as devastating, especially at a time when people in the city were about to harvest their farmlands and bring home their produce.\n'Why Borno experienced worst flooding in 30yrs'\nThe collapse of Alau Dam, which was said to have been filled to capacity for the past one week, was the cause of yesterday's flood in Borno State.\nA statement in the early hours of Tuesday by Professor Usman Tar, the Commissioner for Information and Internal Security, titled 'Flooding Alert for River Bank Residents', called for immediate evacuation.\nHe said, \"Due to the unusually high volume of water this year, we urge all the residents living along the river bank to take immediate action to protect themselves and their properties.\n\"The Alau Dam water has broken down another channel that is currently destroying farms and the water is heading toward the river bank\", he said. Tar also urged the residents of the affected areas to follow evacuation routes to ensure safe passage.\nIn separate statements, yesterday, some civil society organisations (CSOs) described the situation as \"very pathetic\".\nThe chairman of CSOs, Lake-Chad Basin, Ahmed Shehu, said the fate of the animals that escaped from Shehu Sanda Kyarimi Park, a popular zoo in Maiduguri, was yet to be determined.\n\"The zoo road is flooded with water and it is gushing toward the College of Health Technology, Maiduguri, where students from were already relocated to school of nursing. Also, the water is heading towards the Commissioner of Police junction through Damboa Road.\n\"The situation is so dire. The water flooded the zoo at midnight. Though no one can tell the situation of the animals but definitely they will scamper for safety and in the process cause harm to the community.\n\"It is the same water route that displaced people are taking, that the animals will take too.\n\"Aside from wild animals escaping from the zoo, the Christian cemetery around Amb.

On arrival, Governor Babagana Zulum received him and took him to the palace of the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar El-Kanemi, which was also hit by the flood.\nFrom the palace, the vice president drove to Bakassi camp, where thousands of flood-displaced people were taking refuge.\nMr Shettima told the distraught victims that the government would support them with 50 trucks of rice.\nHe added that the government would also collaborate with the North East Development Commission and other agencies to ensure they did not spend more than two weeks at the camp.\nUnprecedented scale\n\"The flood's unprecedented scale has presented challenges beyond our previous experiences,\" the vice president said.\n\"The disaster serves as a sobering reminder of the increasing threats posed by climate change, not just globally, but particularly to North East regions.\n\"Nigeria's vulnerability to flood disasters has been highlighted time and again, as witnessed during the devastating floods of 2012, 2018, and 2022.\n\"The factors contributing to these recurring disasters are diverse, and for this reason, Tinubu has developed a comprehensive roadmap to address these challenges headlong.\n\"Nonetheless, the federal government remains determined in its commitment,\" he said.\nMr Shettima said that, as with other states facing similar crises, the government will mobilise all necessary resources to support all affected persons.\nHe expressed the sympathies of Mr Tinubu to the victims.\n\"I am deeply devastated by the flood that has engulfed Maiduguri and its environs. My heart goes out to the families who have tragically lost their homes and livelihoods in this calamity.\n\"Our grief is shared, but so is our resolve to offer support and comfort as you begin to recover from this disaster.\n\"Now, more than ever, we are compelled as a nation to come together to overcome the losses suffered, and we are committed to finding lasting solutions to this recurring issue,\" he said.\nThe vice president added: \"The flood, which began over the weekend and worsened in the following days, was the direct result of excess water from the Alau Dam.\n\"The collapse of the spillways unleashed a significant surge of water downstream, causing widespread flooding in the surrounding communities.\n\"As we speak, efforts are ongoing to evacuate and resettle residents in the affected areas while ensuring the provision of food, shelter, and medical assistance until the situation stabilises.\"\n2024 Flood Outlook\nMr Shettima said in response to the 2024 Flood Outlook, the government had implemented comprehensive contingency plans and adopted proactive measures to mitigate potential impacts.\nAccording to him, the government intensified its interventions in flood-prone areas characterised by erratic rainfall patterns and complex river basin dynamics.\nHe said the areas had been prioritised in flood mitigation strategies to safeguard communities, protect agricultural zones, and reinforce critical infrastructure.\nHe commended the government of Borno State for its swift and effective response to this tragic situation.\n\"I also want to acknowledge the remarkable resilience of the good people of Maiduguri and surrounding areas, who have demonstrated extraordinary compassion by being their neighbours' keepers.\n\"I am in Maiduguri to oversee the implementation of comprehensive flood mitigation measures.\n\"We will overcome this tragedy as long as our resolve remains strong, as long as we remain united, as long as we remain compassionate, and as long as we prioritise strategic actions to emerge from this even stronger than ever,\" he assured.\nFloods recede\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that many of the flood victims who slept outside said though the water had subsided, they wanted to assess their losses.\n\"We are just rushing to see what is left of our homes and to salvage any remnants of our property we can still use,\" Ali Bana of Gwange ward said.\nMusa Abdullahi of Gomari ward said he was able to get to his house.\n\"My house is still flooded,\" he said. \"From the looks of things, we have more days to spend outside before we can move back in.\"\n239,000 people affected - UN Office\nMeanwhile, a situation report on the flood by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said more than 239,000 people were affected by the flood.\n\"The floods have forced some of the affected people to move spontaneously to the Muna IDP camp, which was already hosting over 50,000 IDPs.\n\"Government authorities have evacuated residents in high-risk riverine areas to several locations,\" the report noted.\nNAN reports that the flood incident has affected communication, power and water supply in most parts of town.\nNEDC begins assessment\nMeanwhile, the North-East Development Commission (NEDC)has begun an on-the-spot assessment of the flood's level of destruction.\nThe commission's managing director, Mohammed Alkali, made this known on Wednesday in a statement signed by Naomi Abwaku, his media assistant, in Abuja.\nWhile sympathising with the victims, Mr Alkali promised that the agency would provide immediate humanitarian assistance to cushion the effect of the flood disaster.\n\"This is an unfortunate incident, and I will advise those living in the flood-prone areas to exercise extreme caution and avoid those areas for their safety,\" he said.\nHe said that the commission will, in the interim, liaise with the state government and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to support the victims.\nAccording to the NEDC director, the commission will provide relief materials to the victims pending the completion of an investigation into the causes of the flood.\nNCoS facilities affected\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) says it was working to mitigate the flood's impact on its facilities in Maiduguri, particularly the Medium Security Custodial Centre.\nAbubakar Umar, Assistant Controller of Corrections and Service Public Relations Officer, stated this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja.\nMr Umar said the NCoS was taking necessary measures to ensure public safety.\n\"Our officers and men are working around the clock to ensure a smooth and secure transfer process.\n\"As the agency responsible for inmate safekeeping, we are taking all necessary measures to ensure public safety, including evacuating inmates to safer facilities, ensuring smooth operations, and collaborating with sister security agencies to provide support and assistance to those affected.\"\nMr Umar thanked the presidency for its support and guidance and for Vice President Shettima's visit to Maiduguri to assess the situation.\nNAN reports that the last time the Allau Dam experienced a similar issue was in 1994, resulting in unprecedented flooding in Maiduguri, with almost half of the town submerged.\nSEMA relief centres\nAlso, the Borno Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) has opened two relief camps to accommodate the people displaced by the flood.\nThe agency's director-general, Barkindo Mohammed, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Maiduguri on Tuesday.\nHe said the two camps--Bakassi and Dalori--situated along Bama Road had the capacity to accommodate over 10,000 families.\nSimilarly, the State Government Committee on Flood, coordinated by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Bukar Tijjani, has continued to focus on evacuation and the provision of relief materials.\nMeanwhile, the Borno Network of Civil Society Organisations (NECSOB) has appealed for urgent assistance from all across Nigeria for the flood victims.\nThe executive director of the network, Bulama Abiso, said the victims were in dire need of support to cushion the effects of the traumatised situation.\n\"A devastating flood has struck Maiduguri, leaving thousands of people homeless, without food, water, or shelter.\n\"The situation is dire, and we urgently need your assistance to provide relief to the affected communities,\" Mr Abiso pleaded.\nHe said such support could be in the form of food and non-food items, medicines and money.\nACF seeks regional planning laws\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has extended its condolences to communities affected by floods caused by overflowing rivers, streams and dams.\nIn a statement issued in Kaduna by Tanko Muhammad-Baba, the ACF's National Publicity Secretary, the forum expressed concerns over the tragic loss of lives, destruction of property, and disruption of livelihoods across several communities.\n\"These floods have caused catastrophic damage to many areas, coming at a time when Nigerians are already struggling with significant economic challenges, including inflation, insecurity, and food shortages.\n\"The floods have only worsened the situation,\" the ACF said.\nThe forum referenced the severe flooding in Maiduguri, where on Tuesday, video footage showed streets and homes submerged, bringing life to a standstill.\n\"Similar scenes have been reported across other northern states, with homes, farmlands, and infrastructure left in ruins.\n\"The devastating images from Maiduguri are just one example of the widespread flooding across many communities, with no clear end in sight,\" it noted.\n\"The ACF grieves with all those affected and prays for comfort for those who have lost loved ones and property,\" it said.\nThe forum called on government agencies, emergency responders, and humanitarian organisations to urgently and without bureaucratic delays provide relief and assistance to affected areas.\nIt also urged the deployment of military engineers to restore damaged infrastructure and provide temporary shelters with basic amenities.\nFurthermore, the ACF emphasised the need for strict enforcement of regional planning regulations, building codes, and environmental laws to prevent future disasters.\nThe forum condemned the negligence and corruption that often result in preventable tragedies.\n\"We must ensure that no more lives, limbs, or property are lost due to incompetence, dereliction of duty, or corrupt practices.\n\"We call on the public to adhere to environmental regulations, maintain proper hygiene, and avoid actions that block drainage systems or waterways,\" the forum said.\nThe ACF also prayed for God's protection over all communities and called for sustained efforts to prevent future natural and man-made disasters.",

        "content": "title: 157,274 Displaced population \n content: OVERVIEW\n\nThe annual rainy season in Nigeria generally starts in April, with the highest concentration of rainfall between June and September. Between August and September 2024, hefty rains affected many LGAs in Borno State, resulting in significant flooding that has devastated various communities. Furthermore, on 9 September 2024, Maiduguri was affected by a massive flood due to the collapse of Alau dam in the neighbouring Konduga LGA of Borno State. The collapse of the dam, exacerbated the flooding in Maiduguri in addition to the continuous heavy rainfall. This marks the first time the Alau Dam has overflowed since 2012. The floods have caused extensive damage to infrastructure, crops, and shelters, severely affecting livelihoods and displacing many households. Climate variability and human-induced factors have exacerbated the flood recently, leading to increased displacement across Nigeria.\n\nBetween 4 and 12 September 2024, the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), in collaboration with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the Borno State Emergency Management Agency (BOSEMA), and the Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), identified 138 locations in Borno State that were impacted by floods or received internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the flooding. Through a network of key informants and field focal points, and in close coordination with other humanitarian partners and local authorities, DTM conducted assessments in these locations to provide insights to the humanitarian community on the affected population's primary needs, vulnerabilities, and mobility intentions.\n\nIn the 19 local government areas (LGAs) of Borno State that were assessed, DTM identified 320,791 individuals in 65,731 households affected by the floods. These individuals included IDPs displaced by the floods and residents impacted by the floods but remained in their communities. The affected population included 157,274 displaced individuals and 108 returnees.\n\nMETHODOLOGY Crises and emergencies require the humanitarian community to act urgently. As a subcomponent of DTM\u2019s mobility tracking, flash reports utilise direct observation and a broad network of key informants to monitor sudden displacement resulting from natural disasters or attacks and collect information on the number, profile, and immediate needs of affected populations. In the initial 24 - 48 hours after an incident, DTM Nigeria activates a rapid assessment to document the event, urgent needs of affected individuals, demographic information, and impact. DTM Nigeria issues an Early Warning Flash/Incident report within 72 hours if displacement occurs, notifying partners and stakeholders.\n\nIOM Nigeria thanks the following partners for their continued support and collaboration in making this report available.\n---\nLGAs affected by floods\n\nNIGER\n\nBENIN\n\nNIGERIA Yusufari Yusufari !

In total, 65,731 households and 320,791 individuals were affected by the flood across the assessed LGAs in Borno State.\n---\nMOST URGENT NEEDS\n\nFood was reported among the top three most urgent needs in 93 per cent of locations assessed. Food security is a primary concern, likely due to the destruction of crops, disruption of markets, and the displacement of families from their sources of income and sustenance due to the flooding. Food was closely followed by shelter, reported in 91 per cent of the locations. This further highlights the impact of the flood, which caused widespread destruction of homes and the displacement of households. Non-food items (NFIs) were mentioned in 89 per cent of locations assessed: Non-food items, such as blankets, clothing, cooking utensils, and hygiene products, were urgently needed. Many households have lost their possessions or do not have sufficient resources to meet basic daily needs. Providing NFIs wouldl help restore a sense of normalcy and improve living conditions in displacement settings. Although a smaller percentage (9%) of the locations assessed identified health as an immediate need, it remains significant, indicating that access to healthcare services and medical supplies was a concern. This could be due to injuries from the floods, the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, or the disruption of existing healthcare facilities.\n\nWater, sanitation and hygiene services were critical for four per cent of the locations assessed. While this percentage may seem low, it still indicates a need for clean water access and improved sanitation facilities to prevent disease outbreaks, particularly in overcrowded shelters. The need for psychosocial support was identified by three per cent of the locations assessed, which may reflect the emotional and psychological toll of the disaster. The provision of mental health and psychosocial services remains essential to address trauma, stress, and anxiety caused by the loss of homes, livelihoods, and loved ones.\n\nSecurity was noted in one per cent of the locations as an urgent need, suggesting that the immediate physical safety of the affected population was not a primary concern at this stage. However, ongoing monitoring and support for security services may be required to ensure stability, especially in crowded displacement areas.\n\nThe most pressing needs reported were related to basic survival, with food, shelter, and non- food items being the top priorities.

Pregnant women (15,541 individuals), breastfeeding mothers (29,597 individuals), the elderly (14,837 individuals), and persons with chronic illnesses (447 individuals) require immediate and sustained access to healthcare services. These individuals face significant health risks in displacement settings, where access to healthcare services might be limited, and living conditions could exacerbate pre-existing conditions. Unaccompanied children (316 individuals) and orphaned minors (1,512 individuals) need protection services to ensure their safety and well- being.\n\nFig. 4: Vulnerable persons\n\nPersons with serious medical conditions\n\n1,828 Unaccompanied children and orphaned minors\n\n45,138 Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers\n\n14,837 Elderly persons\n---\nIMPACT AND GAPS Livelihood\n\nThe breakdown of the primary sources of livelihood for the affected population highlights dependency on various income-generating activities, such as crop/vegetable farming, which accounts for 41 per cent of locations assessed. Crop and vegetable farming are the dominant livelihood activities for most individuals in the assessed locations in Borno State. Other income sources include petty trade, mentioned in 29 per cent of the assessed locations. Firewood collection is recorded in 12 per cent of the locations, and eight per cent of the locations were dependent on humanitarian assistance.\n\n41%\n\n2% 2% 3% 3%\n\n8%\n\n12%\n\nFishing Livestock Casual labourer Small business activity Humanitarian assistance Collectiing firewood Petty trade Crop/Vegetable farming\n\n29% Fig. 5: Main source of livelihood for majority in the location before the floods\n\n9,768\n\nFarmlands submerged as a result of the floods Fig. 6: Farmlands affected\n\n14454.5 Estimated area of farmland submerged as a result of the floods (in hectares)\n\n14%\n\n36%\n\nFarmlands completely destroyed Farmlands partially destroyed as a result of the flood as a result of the flood Fig. 7: Status of farmlands after the flood\n\n56%\n\n30%\n\nFoodstocks partially Foodstocks not affected affected by the flood by the flood\n\nFig. 8: Status of foodstocks after the flood\n\nMaize\n\nMillet 36% Beans 32% Rice 30% Sorghum 21% Groundnut 18% Watermelon 1% Soya beans 1% Guinea corn 1% Cowpea 1% Tomatoes 1% Yam 1% Fig. 9: Crops planted within the year (multiple response)\n\n50% Farmlands not affected\n\n14% Foodstocks completely affected by the flood 54%\n---\n70% 30% Yes Fig. 10: Access to farmland after the flood\n\n70%\n\n30% No\n\n38% 29% 18% 17% 7%\n\nNo agricultural The difficulty to Fear that my crops Non-availability of No more access to input cope with the will be destroyed irrigation farmland losses of the flood by herds infrastructure Fig. 11: Factors restricting plans to replant in the future (multiple response)\n\n71% 24% Hybrid In cash only (In cash and kind) Fig. 12: Preferred modality of assistance\n\n5% In kind only`\n\n45% 55% Yes No Fig. 13: Access to an operational (accessible and functional) financial institution in the community\n\n86% 14% Yes No Fig. 14: Access to an operational (accessible and functional) market institution in the community Education 84% 2% 14% Yes No Don\u2019t know Fig. 15: Access to education facilities after flood\n\n15% 83% 2% Yes No Don\u2019t know Fig. 16: Availability of education facilities within a 30 minute walking distance\n---\nFLOOD SITUATION REPORT \u2014 BORNO STATE Shelter 18,780 19,717 18,308 10,534\n\nHabitable, do not need Habitable but need repairs repairs Fig. 17: Shelter conditions\n\n7,475 175,888 Emergency shelter Block/brick shelter Fig. 18: Shelter conditions\n\nPartially damaged and need repairs\n\n10,212 Self-made/make-shift shelter\n\nCompletely damaged 6,994 No shelter\n\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)\n\n20% 77% 3% Yes No Don't know Fig. 19: Access to an operational (accessible and functional) financial institution in the community\n\n2,990 Toilets/latrines affected by flood\n\nFig. 20: Status of toilets/latrines after flood\n\nPartially damaged water points\n\nFig. 21: Status of water points after flood\n\n4,393 Toilets/latrines completely damaged by flood\n\nCompletely damaged water points\n\n86%\n\n27% 20% 7% 7% 5% 5% Borehole Hand pump Tapstand Water truck Unprotected Surface water Protected well water well Fig. 22: Water sources available in the community (multiple response) Health\n\n16%\n\n82%\n\nYes No Fig. 23: Barriers accessing healthcare since flood\n\n1% Dam\n\n1% Water satchets\n\n2% Don\u2019t know\n---\n96% 4% Yes No Fig. 24: Cases of acute diarrhea diseases and cholera related illnesses as a result of the flood\n\n21%\n\n76%\n\nYes No Fig. 25: Access to flood warnings or any other information on flood\n\n3% Don\u2019t know\n\nIOM staff conducting data collection in Fulatari Camp of Dikwa LGA in Borno State \u00a9 IOM Nigeria / Isaac Gana MALGWI / IOM 2024\n---\nTable 1: Number of persons affected and displaced by flood LGA Ward Location\n\nAffected households\n\nAffected population\n\nDisplaced households\n\nDisplaced individuals\n---\nLGA\n\nWard\n\nLocation\n\nAffected households\n\nAffected population\n\nDisplaced households\n\nDisplaced individuals\n---\nLGA\n\nWard\n\nLocation\n\nAffected households\n\nAffected population\n\nDisplaced households\n\nDisplaced individuals\n---\nClick here to download table\n---\nDISCLAIMER The opinions expressed in the report are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

        "content": "title: Rapid Needs Assessment Report FLOOD RESPONSE MMC and JERE LGAs Maiduguri September 2024 \n content: ---\nBackground\n\nMore than 239,000 people were affected following severe flash flooding in the MMC and Jere LGAs in Maiduguri after the Alau Dam in neighbouring Konduga LGA breached its banks on the 9th of September 2024, following structural damage and continued heavy rains in Bama, Damboa and Gwoza LGAs. In Maiduguri, the most affected areas include Gwange, Bama Road, Maiduguri Zoo, Post office, State Secretariat, Lagos Street, Shehu\u2019s palace, the Maiduguri Main Market, Customs / Gamboru areas, Budum, Specialist Hospital and Post Office general area. Government authorities evacuated residents in high-risk riverine areas to several locations into 6 camps with most of the IDP households being settled in Ali Sheriff, Bakasi Camp, Yerwa GGSS, Dalori, Teachers Village Flood IDP Camp and Asheik Jarma Primary School.\n\nThe Rapid Response Mechanism, following coordination with OCHA and the AAWG conducted rapid needs assessment to understand the immediate needs of the affected households settled in the camps. The RNA was conducted for between the 11th and 12th of September using a household questionnaire and WASH checklist in the 4 camps of Ali Sheriff, Bakasi Camp, Yerwa GGSS and Asheik Jarma Primary School.\n---\nMethodology\n\nThis assessment was conducted using a systematic approach to evaluate the flood needs of households affected by flooding in 4 camps. The methodology employed various tools and strategies to ensure comprehensive data collection and analysis.\n\nHousehold Data Collection: Household data collection was conducted in Ali Sheriff, Bakasi Camp, Yerwa GGSS and Asheik Jarma Primary School where IDPs affected by floods were settled. A multi-sectoral questionnaire was deployed using KOBO collect. Data collection was carried out by trained enumerators and implementing partners.\n\nSampling Methodology: Quantitative data was collected through a household survey using simple random sampling techniques. Enumerators from the community and staff from implementing partners supported the data collection process. The respondents targeted were household heads. The survey reached a total of 525 households in the 4 camps. While this sample size does not fully meet the initial sampling target, it provides valuable insights into the needs and conditions of the affected population.\n\nEthical Consideration Informed Consent: Participation was entirely voluntary, and participants\u2019 consent was sought before proceeding with any interview. Participants received detailed information about the purpose and approach of the assessments to empower them with knowledge about the process before starting the interview.\n\nAnonymity and Confidentiality: The rights to anonymity and confidentiality of all participants were given utmost importance. Throughout the data collection period, respondents were guaranteed that all data collected would be kept strictly confidential and solely used for the purpose of the needs assessment. Data collectors provided a thorough introduction to all assessment tools before commencing interviews. The names of the respondents were not captured, ensuring responses could not be traced back to individuals.\n\nDemographics 34%\n\n66%\n\n346 were women representing 66% of the sample\n\n179 respondents were man representing 34% of the population.\n\nA total of 525 households were interviewed during the survey, of the interviewed 346 were women representing 66% of the sample. The remaining 179 respondents were man representing 34% of the population.\n---\nHousehold Vulnerabilities\n\nThe survey explored the vulnerabilities of households impacted by the floods in the for assessed camps Ali Sheriff, Bakasi Camp, Yerwa GGSS, and Asheik Jarma Primary School. This would help to ascertain their ability to cope with the impact of the floods on their households as well as their ability to recover.\n\nThe survey results indicate that 95% of the interviewed households had been impacted by the recent floods in Maiduguri. Of those that reported that their households had been impacted by the floods, 94% reported that the impact was \u201csevere\u201d, 5% reported that the impact was \u201cmoderate\u201d, whilst 1% reported that the impact was \u201cminor\u201d. The impact of the floods on the households resulted in most families being internally displaced with 91% of the assessed households being hosted in the 4 assessed camps and the remaining 9% were being hosted by their relatives and friends in less affected areas.\n\nImpact of floods on household 5%\n\n94%\n\nSevere Moderate Minor\n\nImpact of daily activities\n\nSanitation Services impacted People are sick Mobility of adults impacted Electricity services impacted Water services affected Restricted access to health services Affected Livelihoods Restricted access to markets Education affected\n\n40% 60%\n\n58% 51% 62%\n\n59% 80% 71% 76%\n\n06 07 08\n---\nThe assessment explored the impact of the floods on the household daily activities as part of understanding household vulnerability. The results indicate that the floods have impacted on both social wellbeing and economic activities of the households. Results indicate that most of the respondents 80% reported that the floods had impacted on the household\u2019s livelihood activities, this points to the lack of ability of households to meet their basic needs thereby increasing their vulnerability. The second ranked impact was on education as reported by 76% of the respondents, most of the IDPs were currently hosted in schools impacting access to education by children, in addition the closure of schools due to the floods has negative impact on the children who would require education in emergency services. Restricted access to markets was reported by 71% and this mainly impacted on household\u2019s ability to access food and other daily necessities. WASH services were also highlighted (water 62% and sanitation services 40%). Restriction to health services was reported by 59% of the respondents pointing out to the need for mobile health services where possible.\n\nMost vulnerable groups 75% 35% Children Women\n\n5% Men\n\nAs part of understanding the household vulnerability due to the floods, the assessment explored the most vulnerable groups based on the understanding of the respondents. The results of the survey indicate that 75% of the respondents felt that children were the most vulnerable in the face of the current floods. Several unaccompanied children were observed in the camps thereby increasing protection risks for the children. Women were reported as the most vulnerable group by 37% of the respondents, women were reported to be more at risk of increased SGBV, hence the need for urgently setting up protection services to support the identified groups.\n\nImmediate interventions should focus on providing emergency WASH response, shelter, health care, nutrition screening, and economic support, especially for the most vulnerable people. Long-term interventions must aim to enhance the resilience of affected people, providing them with secure and sustainable livelihoods, and improving living conditions to mitigate future risks.\n---\nAssessment Results\n\nPriority Needs\n\nTo understand the needs of the affected population in the camps after the floods, households were asked based on their ranking to list their Top 3 priority needs. This would help in providing key information in the design of the response and to ensure that beneficiaries needs are considered during the response. From the results the top 3 priority needs identified are as follows:\n\nPriority 1: Food Supplies 97% \u2013 The need for food assistance was highlighted as an urgent and priority need by 97% of the assessed households. The floods had impacted the households by damaging their shelters. Hence most of the household had lost their food stocks which had been kept in the house. In addition, due to the impact on their livelihoods, households\u2019 capacity to meet their basic needs has been affected.\n\nPriority 2: Clothing and Blankets 87%- The assessment results indicated that most households had lost their household items, and this impacted on their access to clothing and blankets including other basics NFIs.\n\nOthers Transportation Medical Assistance Temporary Shelters Clean drinking water Sanitation and hygiene Clothing and blanket Food Supplies\n\n4%\n\nPriority needs 30% 04 06\n\n72% 76% 77%\n\n82%\n\n87% 97%\n\nPriority 3: Sanitation and Hygiene services 82%- The need for sanitation and hygiene services was requested by 82% of the assessed households. Direct observation in the assessed camps revealed that there were high cases of open defecation, evidence of fecal contamination could be observed on the roads, shelters and near water sources in Al Sherif camp, Bakasi camp and Yerwa GSSS camp posing risks of diseases. It could also be observed that there was no evidence of handwashing facilities and proper waste disposal exposing households to health risks.\n\nIn addition to the top 3 priority needs, households highlighted the need for clean drinking water 72% of the respondents. Water facilities in the assessed camps were not functional requiring some form of maintenance, in addition the number of people in the camp increased pressure on the available water sources hence impacting on access to water by IDP households. Temporary shelter was prioritized by 76% of the population, whilst 72% requested for medical assistance.\n---\nSectoral Findings\n\nWASH Access to water\n\nThe assessment results indicated that households were struggling to access water in the IDP camps as observed during the assessment. Households reported to be relying on other sources of water 59% of the respondents, which mainly included water trucking by humanitarian partners and those who had access were buying water sachets. About 23% reported to have access of borehole water whilst 18% were accessing piped water. The average distance to the water source based on minutes as was about 9 minutes with the highest amount of time being reported being 60 minutes.\n\nCurrent source of water 23% 59% 18% Other Borehole Piped\n\n50% Safe\n\nObserved quality of water\n\n34%\n\nDont Know\n\n3% 13% Contaminated Other\n\nHouseholds were interviewed on the quality of the water that they were accessing whilst in the IDP camps. About 50% of the respondents indicated that the water they were accessing was safe, 34% were however not sure about the safety of the water that they were consuming. Additionally, 13% of the interviewed households felt that the water they were consuming was contaminated. In addition, household were interviewed on the quantity of water that individuals per in their household was accessing per day, this was to understand if households were accessing adequate water according to the Sphere standards (15 liters per day). Results of the assessment indicate that per average each individual in the assessed households was accessing about 11 liters of water per day which is below the required standard therefore indicating the urgent need for provision of emergency water trucking.\n\nFurthermore, the assessment investigated on access to water purification by affected households. This was particularly important since most water sources had been affected by the floods and the need to reduce the possibility of water related diarrheal diseases. The assessment result indicates that 93% of the affected households did not have access to water purification tablets. With the possible risks of water related diseases there is a need to ensure households are supported with water treatment or water chlorination at water point to avoid such risks.\n\nThe assessment also investigated challenges that were being faced by households in terms of accessing water. Results indicate that about 81% of the respondents reported that they had to queue for long periods to access water in the IDP camps.\n---\nHouseholds reported that they had to wait between 2 to 4 hours to fetch water and by the time the assessment was done some households reported that they had not yet been able to access water since they arrived in the camp. In addition, about 43% of the respondents reported on restrictions in terms of accessing water, this was in the form of how much each person would collect since the water was limited.\n\nAccess to Sanitation Facilities\n\nAccess to sanitation facility 57%\n\n24%\n\n11%\n\n6%\n\n1%\n\nThe assessment result revealed that 57% of the IDP households did not have access to sanitation facilities resulting in high incidences of open defecation in the camps. Direct observation in the camps revealed evidence of fecal contamination even in critical location such as roads, near shelters and water points. In Yerwa GSSS camp for example, it was observed that there are 10 latrine units of water cistern (WC) located on site, however these were not clean due to unavailability of water and cleaning materials in addition the population in the camp was high compared to the standard proportion to be used per latrine according to humanitarian standards. Hence there is urgent need for construction of emergency latrines to address this need. In addition, the assessment explored the distance to the latrines, results indicated that the average distance to the latrines was 13 meters with the highest distance reported being 200 meters from the shelters.\n\nWith regards to gender and disability considerations, 95% of the respondents reported on the absence of sanitation facilities that accommodated people living with disabilities. Additionally, 85% of the respondents reported that they do not feel safe when accessing the latrines during the night. This was because of absence of gender specific latrines which posed risks especially for women and girls during the night. Consideration should be made during the response to address the needs of these specific groups in the provision of emergency sanitation facilities.\n\n28% 33% Never\n\nFrequency of handwashing\n\n24%\n\nRarely\n\nSometimes\n\n10% 5% Often Always\n---\nAssessment results indicate that the hygiene practices after using the latrines were poor, about 98% of the respondents reported that there were no handwashing facilities near latrines hence this situation did not encourage the habit. In addition, the assessment investigated whether households practiced handwashing during critical moments using soap and ash. About 69% of the assessed households reported that they did not wash their hand with either soap of ash, 14% reported that they washed their hands with soap, 8% reported that they used ash whilst about 10% reported that they used both soap and ash. The frequency of handwashing was explored, and results indicate 33% of the respondents never washed their hands, 28% rarely washed their hands and 24% sometimes washed their hands. The lack of access to handwashing facilities, water and soap were cited as the main barriers.\n\nAccess to hygiene kits 8%\n\n92%\n\nAccess to MHM kits 3%\n\n97%\n\nNo\n\nYes No\n\nYes\n\nLack of access to hygiene messaging since the floods occurred was reported 94% of the respondents, this also increase the lack of knowledge on good hygiene practices by the households. The need for awareness and hygiene education as part of the emergency response cannot be overemphasized. Additionally, assessed households reported that they did not have access to hygiene kits 92% and Menstrual management kits 97%.\n\nShelter\n\nLoss and damages due to flood\n\n3% Others 1% No effect Water leaking into shelter Damage to shelter items Complete destruction of shelter Damage to shelter surroundings Damage to shelter\n\n02 03 04\n\n52%\n\n65% 63% 68% 70%\n\n07 08\n\nThe household vulnerability was assessed by investigating the loss and damage of properties and belongings because of the recent floods. Results of the survey indicate that 96% of the respondents suffered losses due to the floods, whilst 4% reported that they did not experience loss and damage of their belongings. With regards to the losses experienced, 70% of the assessed households reported that the floods had resulted in some form of damage to their shelter damage whilst 68% reported damage to their shelter surroundings.\n---\nIn terms of the extent of the damage, 63% of the assessed households reported that their shelter was completely destroyed, this indicates the urgent need to support households with emergency shelter as an immediate action and shelter reconstruction as part of the recovery phase. In addition, 65% of the assessed households reported on the damage to shelter items, as the water entered in their houses, this also speaks to the level of vulnerability of the households due to the impact of the floods. About 52% of the respondents reported that the floods had resulted in the leaking of water into their shelters thereby rendering them uninhabitable. About 3% of the respondents reported on various losses because of the floods such as loss of food items and stocks which they had stored in their household, loss of financial savings, loss of livelihoods or businesses, loss of livestock, loss of sanitation facilities, whilst some reported they had lost everything they owned.\n\nHealth\n\nThe survey explored the health situation at household level looking at the health concerns that have emerged at household level because of the recent floods. Survey results indicate that 38% of the households assessed had experienced some health issues because of the floods whilst 62% had not experienced any health challenges.\n\n69%\n\nSanitation related health issue No Yes\n\n31%\n\n74%\n\nWaterborne health related issue 26% No Yes\n\nA further look at the aftermath of the floods indicates that about 31% of the households reported that they had experienced sanitation related health issues, whilst about 26% of the households reported that they had experienced waterborne related health issues such as diarrheal. This clearly indicates the urgent need to conduct health promotion activities and to address the WASH situation in the camp to reduce the occurrences of these cases.\n\nWith regards to seeking medical attention, households were interviewed on whether they knew where to access medical assistance if they required it. Results indicate that 62% of the respondents were not aware of where to seek assistance after the floods, this was because there were no facilities in the camps. In addition,97% of the population reported that their children had not received vaccination services since the floods occurred. There is an urgent need for mobile health units to be dispatched to address health concerns in the camps.\n---\nMain Recommendations\n\nBased on the prioritized needs, it is recommended that partners consider the following immediate actions to address the needs of the affected population. Partners are encouraged to consider vulnerable groups such as women, children and people living with disabilities. Conflict sensitivity should be central at the provision of aid by covering all IDP households in the camps. It must be noted that these are recommendation for immediate assistance whilst long term solutions for recovery would need to be informed by another MSNA.\n\nFood Security and Livelihoods\n\nProvision of immediate food assistance through wet feeding covering all IDP households in the camps Provision of cash assistance must consider market functionality, safe access to markets and availability of food on the market. This should be guided by the CWG.\n\nWASH\n\nImmediate support with chlorination at household level (bucket chlorination or distribution of aqua tabs.) Water trucking to ensure access to adequate water. Immediate distribution of WASH NFIs is highly recommended. Identify damaged water points that can be rehabilitated to increase access to water. Construction of emergency latrines where possible and rehabilitation of the damaged latrines Hygiene promotion and education especially focusing on how to reduce the impact of water related diseases.\n\nCCCM &Shelter/NFIs\n\nImmediate distribution of NFI kits to affected households in the camps.\n\nCCCM &Shelter/NFIs\n\nIncreasing surveillance and monitoring of the reported cases of Diarrhea in the camps Provision of health education in coordination with the WASH sector to encourage health seeking behaviors. Deployment of mobile health units in the camps for service provision.\n\nProtection\n\n\u2022 Provision of protection services though setting up protection posts in the camps is highly recommended. \u2022 Protection monitoring and awareness raising is required. \u2022 Strengthening of child protection services especially to address the needs of unaccompanied children.\n---\nAnnexes\n---\n\n---\nPartners\n\nGLOBAL VILLAGE HEALTHCARE INITIATIVE FOR AFRICA",

Schools are closed with some serving as temporary relocation sites. Two major bridges in Maiduguri (Lagos Street Bridge and Gwange Bridge) have partially collapsed. Over 300,000 people have been registered in at least 26 relocation sites, as of 14 September, according to the Borno State Government\u2019s Emergency Operations Centre. Up to 30 sites have been set up and registration is ongoing. In support of Government efforts, the UN and partners are responding to immediate food (wet feeding), water, health and shelter and sanitation needs.\n\nYerwa Camp (Photo Credit: Audu Ali Marte)\n\nInterventions to prevent outbreaks of acute watery diarrhea and cholera are ongoing. The flooding is happening at the height of a food and nutrition crisis \u2013 the lean season. On 14 September a high-level delegation led by the Humanitarian Coordinator and comprising representatives of humanitarian agencies visited Maiduguri to express continued support for the operation and solidarity with the people of Maiduguri. Link to Rapid Needs Assessment Report Link to OCHA\u2019s interactive floods dashboard\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nMore than 300,000 temporarily displaced people have been registered in 30 relocation sites following relocations from flood affected areas in the Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC), Jere and Konduga local government areas (LGAs). As of 15 September, according to the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) of the Borno State Government (BSG). This follows the flash flooding that occurred on the night of 9 September, when the Alau Dam collapsed wreaking havoc across MMC and Jere.\n\nAccess remains restricted with key infrastructure such as the Gwange and Lagos Street bridges in Maiduguri collapsing or partially collapsing. The Muna camp, which is housing approximately 57,000 people, of whom 6,000 are new arrivals, remains cut off from the main city, markets and other services by flood waters. Other communities also remain isolated. The local telecommunications and electricity networks continue to be disconnected in some areas. The main market (Monday Market) in Maiduguri is still flooded, affecting access to food with markets moving to other parts of Maiduguri often disrupting road traffic and potentially causing security issues.\n\nThe numbers of people registered in relocation sites and the number of sites keep increasing. Many sites are crowded with open defecation taking place. Priority needs among affected people are food assistance, wet feeding (most people affected have lost stoves and cooking utensils), potable water, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and safe shelters within the camps. There is also urgent need for protection activities to\n---\nFlash Update 2: Floods in Maiduguri (MMC) and Jere | 2\n\nreduce the risk of gender-based violence, as well as protection of unaccompanied children, including tracing their families. A key priority is to prevent outbreaks of communicable disease, including cholera, ramping up WASH activities to ensure adequate coverage of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. This will also require surveillance for disease and preparedness for outbreaks. It is also expected that cases of malaria and other vector borne disease will increase.\n\nGovernment authorities have relocated residents in high-risk areas to multiple relocation sites. The State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) is helping set up and manage temporary camps in Maiduguri and conducting search and rescue operations, while the Nigerian military has activated 22 disaster response units in Borno and across north-east Nigeria to help reach inaccessible areas and undertake search and rescue for people trapped by the flooding.\n\nIn support of Government efforts, the UN and partners are providing hot meals, water purification tablets, hygiene/dignity kits and cholera kits, as well as emergency health services, among other lifesaving interventions. The UN is also conducting joint rapid needs assessments with authorities to inform the emergency response.\n\nPeople registered at 26 sites by the Borno State Government Emergency Operations Centre as of 14 September\n\n|    | 0   | 1         | 2          | 3                                    | 4          | 5           |\n|----|-----|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------|------------|-------------|\n|  0 | SN  | LGA       | Ward       | Camp Name                            | Households | Individuals |\n|  1 | 1   | Maiduguri | Bolori I   | ALI SHERIFF                          | 1,356      | 8,758       |\n|  2 | 2   | Maiduguri | Maisandari | ASHEIK JARMA                         | 6,052      | 40,854      |\n|  3 | 3   | Maiduguri | Maisandari | BAKKASI CAMP                         | 1,608      | 59,022      |\n|  4 | 4   | Konduga   | Dalori     | DALORI                               | -          | -           |\n|  5 | 5   | Jere      | Mashamari  | DIKWA LOWCOST (AL HABIB)             | -          | -           |\n|  6 | 6   | Maiduguri | Galtimari  | FORI PRIMARY SCHOOL                  | 1,400      | -           |\n|  7 | 7   | Maiduguri | Galtimari  | GALTIMARI PRIMARY SCHOOL             | -          | 12,000      |\n|  8 | 8   | Jere      | Ngomari    | GCC GIRL ACEDAMY                     | -          | 1,600       |\n|  9 | 9   | Maiduguri | Maisandari | GOVERNMENT COLLEGE MAIDUGURI         | -          | -           |\n| 10 | 10  | Maiduguri | Bolori II  | GOVT DAY SEC BULABULIN               | -          | -           |\n| 11 | 11  | Jere      | Limanti    | GREMAMI MOSQUE                       | -          | 12,000      |\n| 12 | 12  | Konduga   | Chabbal    | GUBIO CAMP                           | -          | 8,000       |\n| 13 | 13  | Maiduguri | Gwange     | GWANGE I PRIMARY SCHOOL              | -          | -           |\n| 14 | 14  | Maiduguri | Gwange     | GWANGE II PRIMARY SCHOOL             | -          | -           |\n| 15 | 15  | Maiduguri | Bolori I   | KAMSELEM PRIMARY SCHOOL              | -          | -           |\n| 16 | 16  | Jere      | Mairi      | MAIRI PRIMARY SCHOOL TASHEN BAMA     | -          | 60,000      |\n| 17 | 17  | Maiduguri | Bolori I   | MEGA SCHOOL OPP MAIMALARI            | -          | 12,000      |\n| 18 | 18  | Maiduguri | Bolori II  | NAGARAM PRIMAR SCL                   | -          | -           |\n| 19 | 19  | Jere      | Ngomari    | NGOMARI SCHOOL                       | 4,308      | 31,200      |\n| 20 | 20  | Maiduguri | Gwange     | SHEIKH SHERIFF IBRAHIM SALEH         | -          | -           |\n| 21 | 21  | Maiduguri | Maisandari | TEACHERS VILLAGE                     | -          | 12,000      |\n| 22 | 22  | Jere      | Dusuman    | VOCATIONAL ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE MUNA | -          | -           |\n| 23 | 23  | Maiduguri | Maisandari | WTC                                  | -          | -           |\n| 24 | 24  | Maiduguri | Maisandari | YERWA SCHOOL                         | 7,000      | 43,000      |\n| 25 | 25  | Maiduguri | Bolori II  | ZAJIRI PRIMARY SCHOOL                | -          | -           |\n| 26 | 26  | Maiduguri | Bolori II  | ZAJIRI SECONDARY SCHOOL              | -          | -           |\n| 27 |     | Totals    | 21,724     | 300,434                              |            |             |\n\n(Figures may fluctuate with the triangulation of data and the continued registration of new arrivals daily)\n\nMore than one million people are affected by floods across 29 states in Nigeria as of 12 September, according to the National Emergency Management Authority (NEMA).\n---\nFlash Update 2: Floods in Maiduguri (MMC) and Jere | 3\n---\nFlash Update 2: Floods in Maiduguri (MMC) and Jere | 4\n\nBorno State is the hardest hit in terms of the number of people affected by floods, with more than 414,000 people impacted. In Borno, other affected local government areas include Bama, Damboa, Damasak, Gwoza, Kala Balge, Konduga and Mafa LGAs. While there has been no confirmed case of cholera this year in Borno, there are significant concerns about an outbreak given the deteriorating sanitary conditions and floodwaters. Cholera is endemic in many LGAs in Borno State. Cholera preparedness efforts are ongoing with health teams in place or preparing in key locations. There is also the risk of the spread of other infectious diseases such as measles due to overcrowding. Borno is experiencing a measles outbreak, with 25 of its 27 LGAs reporting cases since the beginning of the year. More than 5,000 suspected cases have been reported.\n\nOther concerns include psychological trauma, insecurity and the protection of unaccompanied and separated children and other vulnerable groups.\n\nOn 14 September, a high-level interagency delegation led by the Humanitarian and Resident Coordinator visited Maiduguri. It comprised UN heads of agencies, country directors of international and local NGOs, as well as donors. In addition to visiting displacement sites and meeting with partners, the mission also met with the Governor of Borno and his cabinet, as well as federal ministers and representatives. The mission also met with local humanitarian staff, many who had fallen victims to the flooding. The mission expressed its support and solidarity those affected by flooding, humanitarian staff, and local authorities. The Governor of Borno, his Excellency Babagana Zullum, expressed thanks to the humanitarian community for its support and also echoed the words of the Humanitarian Coordinator of the need to come together as one in the response to address the plight of people affected.\n\nIn Adamawa, close to 50,000 people are affected by floods, with approximately 20,000 receiving relief assistance from the state government, UN agencies and partners. Despite these efforts, significant gaps remain in WASH, shelter materials, food and medicines. Adamawa is also on high alert following warnings of more flooding from 16 to 30 September in the affected LGAs (Mubi, Madagali, Michika, Demsa, Numan, and Shelleng). People have been encouraged to move to higher ground to avert the potential loss of life.\n\nAcross the country, floods have so far claimed more than 250 lives, according to NEMA, with the highest death tolls recorded in Borno, Kano, Jigawa, Bauchi and Bayelsa states. Besides Borno, other states most affected by floods include Bauchi, Bayelsa, Enugu, Jigawa, Kano, Niger, Sokoto, and Zamfara.\n\nThe floods have damaged tens of thousands of hectares of farmland across the country ahead of the harvest season amid record spikes in food and fuel inflation, following the devaluation of the naira and the removal of the fuel subsidy. States that have recorded widespread damage to farmland include Bauchi, Taraba, Niger, Jigawa and Sokoto. The damage to crops risks elevating food insecurity in the ongoing lean season, and in the coming months. This may lead to a further deterioration in the already alarming food insecurity across the country. More than 32 million people in Nigeria are facing severe food insecurity, according to the March 2024 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 food security and nutrition assessment.\n\nAt the national level, NEMA has activated an Emergency Operation Center (EOC) in Abuja and is holding regular coordination meetings with stakeholders to respond to the floods.\n---\nFlash Update 2: Floods in Maiduguri (MMC) and Jere | 5\n\nGOVERNMENT, UN AND NGO RESPONSE SEMA (State Emergency Management Agency)\n\nAs of 14 September, the Borno State Government (BSG) has set up to 30 camps in MMC and Jere for affected people, with more than 300,000 people registered in 26 of the camps, with registration ongoing at the newly set up camps. More camps are expected to be set up as the situation develops.\n\nFollowing the flash floods, the BSG launched search and rescue especially in areas where people were cut off. The military and some private individuals provided boats and canoes used in these operations.\n\nThe BSG provided wet feeding in the 10 initial camps, with partners\u2019 support enabling the provision of food to people cut off using helicopters. The BSG has provided wet feeding for over 100,000 people so far.\n\nThe BSG together with health partners set up clinics in all the initial camps and is working to ensure that all other camps have a running clinic.\n\nThe BSG stationed water trucks at all initial camps and is striving to keep pace with the growing number of camps. These trucks deliver water daily, and efforts are underway to establish additional water collection points. Additionally, latrines have been constructed, and waste evacuation services organized to maintain sanitary conditions. In several camps, extensive bush clearing, and fumigation have been carried out by the state environmental protection agency. The state government has supplied water treatment materials and chemicals, with support from UNICEF.\n\nNEMA (National Emergency Management Agency)\n\nThe ongoing response by NEMA includes:\n\n\u2022 Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) meeting with stakeholders. \u2022 Activation of the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC). \u2022 Sector meetings to respond to the flood situation. \u2022 Activation of IDP camps in some states. \u2022 Search and rescue operations. \u2022 Staff deployment for assessments and evacuations in the affected states. \u2022 Deployment of water purification equipment to the affected states. \u2022 Provision of life jackets to the affected states.\n\nThe planned response includes: \u2022 Provision of additional relief interventions. \u2022 Provision of medical consumables and medicaments to the affected people. \u2022 Additional support to sectoral responses. \u2022 Additional support to Naval DRUs within the riverine communities (such as boats and life jackets) for marine rescue. \u2022 Supporting the states to evacuate people at risk. \u2022 Deployment of additional water purifiers to the states. \u2022 Relocation and rehabilitation of the displaced people. \u2022 Damage and loss assessments.\n\nFederal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA)\n\n\u2022 FMHAPA is working with state governments and SEMAs in 15 states to conduct needs assessments. These states are Adamawa, Akwa-Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross River, Delta, Jigawa, Kebbi, Kogi, Lagos, Niger, Rivers, Sokoto and Zamfara.\n---\nFlash Update 2: Floods in Maiduguri (MMC) and Jere | 6\n\nUN /NGO\n\nWorld Food Programme (WFP) \u2022 Through UNHAS support, conducted two helicopter flights near Muna IDP camp. The first flight transported an assessment team comprising representatives from WFP, OCHA, INTERSOS, and the State Government. During the second flight, on 12 September, WFP airlifted 700 kilogrammes of ready-to-eat food items, including sardines, bread, and water, provided by the Government. This assistance, while critical, is but a drop in the ocean given the level of urgent needs since the onset of flooding. \u2022 WFP in partnership with INTERSOS and the Borno SEMA has continued to scale up its hot meals programme in the Teachers\u2019 Village and Yerwa camps, providing two hot meals daily to 16,200 people, which accounts for 32 per cent of the target of 50,000 people per day. \u2022 WFP\u2019s hot meals programme started on 11 September and is expected to last for 15 days, when the situation will be reassessed. Households receive meals of rice (provided by USAID) and beans. The ration per person per day is 250g of fortified rice, 100g of beans, 25g of vegetable oil and 5g of iodised salt. In addition, children under two years receive 50g of PlumpyDoz (a lipid based nutrient supplements) and pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls receive 200g of CSB++ (fortified blended food). The ration covers 100 per cent of the 2,100 Kcal required for adults. With the ration provide by WFP, beneficiaries eat three meals a day. \u2022 When affected people are able to prepare their own meals, WFP will start distributing dry food rations to cover approximately 115,000 people. \u2022 Food supplies have also been delivered to the Women Teachers College IDP camp, with further scaling up planned for 14 September.\n\nUN Population Fund (UNFPA) \u2022 Assessment with UN Women and the Gender Technical Group (GTG) to address the critical sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and Gender-based violence (GBV) needs of displaced people in all formal camps and host communities. \u2022 Distributed 200 dignity kits targeting adolescent girls and women of reproductive age in Bakassi Camp, Maiduguri on 13 September. \u2022 Identified, trained, and mobilized 60 community volunteers from the affected communities to conduct community awareness on GBV prevention, PSEAH, GBV/SRH referral pathways. \u2022 Mobilized 30 nurses, midwives GBV case workers trained on integrated on SRH and GBV services to support GBV and SRH service provision in established clinics and safe spaces. \u2022 Procured and distributed additional dignity kits including culturally appropriate dresses/clothes to the most vulnerable displaced women and girls.\n\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) \u2022 MSF-France initiated medical interventions in Teachers Village Camp, where 16,000 displaced people are living, with the number expected to rise to 30,000. \u2022 Conducted 106 outpatient consultations and is working to repair at least one borehole to restore access to drinking water at Teachers Village Camp, and to rehabilitate at least 10 latrines to improve sanitation. \u2022 MSF Emergency Cell will assess further needs and coordinate cholera response preparedness, as cholera remains a significant concern. \u2022 MSF-Belgium is active in several camps, focusing on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions alongside mobile medical clinics.

Credit @ NCDC\n\nDate when the trigger was met 03-01-2024\n\nWhat happened, where and when?\n\nIn 2024, the Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria escalated significantly, with the number of suspected cases rising to 7,407, compared to 6,597 reported during the same period in 2023. By week 29, the number of new confirmed cases increased from 7 in epidemiological week 28 to 11. From week 1 to week 29 in 2024, there have been 163 reported deaths, resulting in a case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.1%, slightly higher than the 16.9% CFR for the same period in 2023. Lassa fever has now spread to 28 states, with at least one confirmed case in 125 Local Government Areas (LGAs), and 32 healthcare workers have been infected across 27 states, including the FCT.\n\nThe worst-affected states are Bauchi, Taraba, Edo, Ondo, Plateau, Benue, Cross River, Rivers, Anambra, and Ebonyi, with a total of 125 LGAs impacted. The predominant age group affected is 31-40 years (Range: 1 to 98 years, Median Age: 32 years), with an equal male-to- female ratio among confirmed cases.\n\nSince February, when the cases began to peak, the Nigeria Red Cross Society (NRCS) was called upon for support by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and various response platforms. Despite Lassa fever being endemic in Nigeria, the case fatality rate (CFR) of 18.8% reported in week 12 was alarming, revealing significant gaps in coordination with health partners, which raised considerable concerns. The number of suspected cases also surged dramatically to 5,029 from January to week 12 in 2024, compared to 3,361 during the same period in 2023.\n\nAmong the worst-affected states, Bauchi, Taraba, Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Benue, and Cross River are endemic to Lassa fever. In contrast, Plateau, Rivers, and Anambra are newly affected states, where awareness of the symptoms, prevention, and treatment of the disease is minimal or non-existent. In Ebonyi and Benue, new LGAs that were not previously affected by Lassa fever began reporting cases, including within IDP camps in Benue State. This situation underscored the urgent need to engage communities in these areas to raise awareness about the signs and symptoms of Lassa fever and improve early detection and timely presentation of cases through active case searches and referrals.\n\nPage 2 / 18\n---\nNRCS Volunteers supporting Community Sanitation in Plateau State\n\nScope and Scale\n\nThe Lassa Fever outbreak in Nigeria has taken an alarming turn, spreading to areas that had never previously reported cases. This expansion posed significant challenges, as the newly affected states had limited experience in managing the disease and lacked the necessary resources and infrastructure for timely detection and response. In response to this evolving situation, the Red Cross scaled up its intervention efforts, targeting newly affected LGAs in the endemic states and the newly impacted states with high case fatalities.\n\nThe Red Cross\u2019 intervention efforts have shown promising results, as reflected in the recent decline in the Lassa Fever epicurve over the past few weeks. The NCDC has acknowledged the Red Cross' contributions, with the latest epidemiological data indicating a reduction in the number of new Lassa Fever cases compared to the earlier stages of the outbreak.\n\nThrough this DREF Operation, the NRCS has significantly contributed to several key areas:\n\nStrengthened Surveillance and Early Detection: Red Cross volunteers are collaborating closely with state and local authorities to enhance disease surveillance systems, enabling the rapid identification and reporting of suspected Lassa Fever cases in all targeted areas. Community members and informants were trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of Lassa Fever, facilitating prompt case detection and reporting.\n\nImproved Case Management and Infection Prevention: NRCS is supporting healthcare facilities in both endemic and non-endemic states by providing personal protective equipment and conducting hygiene promotion sessions to ensure the safe and effective management of Lassa Fever patients.\n\nEnhanced Community Engagement and Awareness: Widespread public awareness campaigns, including roadshows and market rallies, are conducted to educate communities about the mode of transmission, prevention measures, and the importance of early reporting and care-seeking behaviors. IEC materials were produced and distributed across the communities. NRCS teams also engaged traditional and religious leaders to address cultural barriers and promote health-seeking behavior among community members.\n\nPsychosocial Support: The NRCS provides psychosocial support to healthcare workers, affected persons, families, survivors, and volunteers. This support helped address stigma and discrimination, and fear and anxiety among frontline responders. Lassa Fever remains endemic in several states in Nigeria, including Bauchi, Taraba, Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Benue, and Cross River. However,\n\nPage 3 / 18\n---\nthe disease has also spread to newly impacted states such as Plateau, Rivers, and Anambra, where awareness of the symptoms, prevention, and treatment of Lassa Fever is low. During the planning of this operation, a strategic decision was made to replace Cross River, an endemic state, with Rivers State as a target area. This shift was based on the observation that, while Cross River is indeed affected by Lassa Fever, Rivers State had a higher case fatality rate and lower awareness about the disease among the local population. By focusing on Rivers State, the operation was able to direct resources and interventions towards a non-endemic area experiencing a rise in reported cases, where community knowledge about the disease was limited. This strategic shift aimed to have a greater impact on saving lives through improved early detection and timely presentation of cases.\n\nWhile recent trends are encouraging, the battle against Lassa Fever is far from over, especially with the next outbreak season fast approaching. The NRCS has therefore begun engaging with the government, communities, and other partners to sustain community actions and develop long-term strategies that will reduce the impact of Lassa Fever in the affected communities.\n\nSource Information\n\nSource Name 1.

This extension also involves replacing Cross River State with Rivers State, following a recommendation from the NCDC. The additional time will allow the National Society to complete following critical activities: - Finalize the KAP survey, analyze the data, and use the results to organize round-table discussions with government stakeholders and TWG members on Lassa Fever. - Conduct post-distribution monitoring. - Continue roadshows and live call-in radio shows to enhance outreach. - Hold a lesson-learned workshop to document insights, inform the SEAP, and guide future response actions. - Support vendor payments and finalize reporting.\n\nThe extension is necessary due to the following delays: - Procurement Issues: The acquisition of WASH materials was delayed by central procurement guidelines and the public tender bidding process. - Late Deliveries: Vendors delayed the delivery of procured items. - Extended Data Collection: The KAP Survey\u2019s data collection phase was prolonged due to difficulties in accessing remote areas and ensuring data accuracy. - Contractual Delays: Bureaucratic hurdles delayed the finalization of contracts with local radio stations. - The National Society has addressed these challenges: procured items have been delivered, a contract with the radio station has been finalized, radio talk shows are ongoing, and a financial report has been shared with the IFRC, pending review.\n\nTo date, the activities conducted include:\n\nPage 4 / 18\n---\n- Identified and referred 5,239 suspected Lassa fever cases to health facilities and Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers for investigation by Red Cross volunteers. - Conducted hygiene promotion sessions, including vector control and sanitation programmes in 103 communities. - Reached 1,189,099 people (227,468 households) with health and hygiene promotion and education activities through community meetings, group discussions, FGDs, school sensitizations, house-to-house outreach, roadshows, and live call-in radio shows. - Provided psychosocial support services to 13,272 people, including those with symptoms, survivors, families, and healthcare workers. - Conducted Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Surveys to understand beliefs and misconceptions in endemic communities. - Collected and documented 1,003 pieces of community feedback to build trust, promote participation, and encourage ownership. - Conducted 10 roadshows across six states. - Held 7 live call-in radio shows. - Distributed 6,000 rat traps and 18,000 pieces of soap to affected households in the six states.\n\nThe current expenditure rate is 36%, but this is expected to increase significantly due to pending vendor payments and volunteer incentives.\n\nThe revision of the target location from Cross River to Rivers State occurred during a joint planning meeting between the NRCS and the NCDC on 18 April 2024. Epidemiological data at the time indicated that Rivers State, previously non-endemic, was now reporting Lassa fever cases, while Cross River State, though affected, remains an endemic state with recurring outbreaks.\n\nThis decision underscores the commitment of the NRCS and NCDC to evidence-based planning and the adjustment of operational plans to ensure resources are directed where they are most needed. As a result, the DREF operation now targets the following six states: Benue, Delta, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, and Rivers.\n\nCurrent National Society Actions\n\nStart date of National Society actions 10-03-2024\n\nCommunity meeting with Women group in Rivers State Page 5 / 18\n---\nCoordination\n\nThe NRCS actively participates in the weekly Lassa fever technical working group (TWG) meetings led by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control where updates were provided on Lassa fever reporting and trends across the country. At the State level, branch teams also participate in sub-national EOC meetings with the Ministry of Health and other state actors.\n\nNational Society Readiness\n\nThe Nigerian Red Cross Society has been supporting the government in tackling and responding to epidemic diseases, working collaboratively with the Government of Nigeria through, the Ministry of Health, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA). With viable branches in the 37 states and the FCT, the NS has approximately 800,000 volunteers across the country. To ensure a prompt response to emergency health issues, the NRCS has a team of Health Action Team (HAT) members, Mothers' Club volunteers, and National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) members who are trained in Epidemic Control, WASH, Infection Prevention and Control, and community-based surveillance. These teams were deployed within the first weeks of the outbreak to enhance epidemic readiness by engaging in the following activities: - Following the declaration of the Lassa Fever Outbreak, the NRCS activated her Health Action Team members across the states to initiate the following readiness activities: - Community Engagement and Education: Raise awareness about Lassa Fever prevention, symptoms, and treatment through campaigns and media. - Surveillance: Active case search and referral. - Health Promotion: Encouraging hygiene practices and demonstrating the use of protective equipment. - Psychosocial Support: Offering emotional support to affected individuals and communities. - Coordination: Working with local authorities and health agencies for a unified response.\n\nIFRC Network Actions Related To The Current Event\n\nSecretariat Page 6 / 18\n\nThe IFRC Cluster Delegation in Nigeria plays a vital role in supporting the NRCS in both emergency preparedness and response, and in the implementation of longer-term programmes. Based in Abuja, the IFRC Secretariat provides overall oversight and guidance for the ongoing DREF operation, with dedicated operations and health teams offering technical support to the NRCS.\n\nThe IFRC Abuja Cluster Delegation works closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Partner National Societies (PNSs) present in Nigeria. This collaboration ensures that all activities align with the broader strategic goals of the IFRC, avoiding duplication of efforts, and maximizing the effective use of resources. The IFRC facilitates regular information exchange among Movement partners through various platforms, including Movement Technical Working Group meetings, coordination meetings, workshops, and joint planning sessions. These efforts ensure that all stakeholders are well-informed about ongoing operations, challenges, and opportunities.\n\nBeyond supporting the DREF operation, the IFRC is leading the development of the NRCS 2025 Unified Plan. This includes providing technical support to the NRCS and coordinating with PNSs to pool funds, human resources, and materials, thereby enhancing the impact of their interventions.\n\nThe IFRC Cluster Delegation also represents the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement in engagements with government bodies, international organizations, and other key stakeholders in Nigeria. In these forums, the IFRC ensures that the perspectives of the Movement are included in discussions and decisions that influence humanitarian action. The delegation works to ensure that Red Cross interventions complement government efforts, aligning with national disaster response plans, public health initiatives, and other governmental priorities.\n---\nIn addition to providing technical guidance, coordinating with Movement partners, and participating in national coordination platforms for the Lassa fever response, the IFRC team is assisting the NRCS in developing a Simplified Early Action Protocol for endemic diseases in Nigeria. This initiative aims to enhance the National Society's capacity to respond effectively to health emergencies.\n\nParticipating National Societies\n\nThe British Red Cross (BRC) is in the country and integrated into the IFRC secretariat. It is engaged in bilateral initiatives alongside the NRCS, focusing on disaster risk reduction (DRR) and disaster management (DM) capacity building. The BRC is providing technical assistance in cash and voucher assistance (CVA) and integrating community engagement and accountability (CEA) into its programs. While not directly contributing to the current operation, the BRC has significantly enhanced the national society's DRR and response capabilities through various training and mentoring sessions for NS staff , volunteers, and NDRTs, some of whom are actively supporting on-going operations. The Norwegian Red Cross is also present in the country and operates within the IFRC secretariat, providing support to NRCS headquarters in areas such as REACH, community-based health programs, and financial system enhancement. With presence at the NRCS National Headquarters and in Benue state, the Norwegian Red Cross is deeply involved in strengthening local capacities. - Additionally, the Italian Red Cross is actively involved in supporting population movement programs at the NRCS headquarters, while the Swedish Red Cross has played a pivotal role in delivering Infection Prevention Control (IPC) training to NS staff, volunteers, and NDRTs, further enhancing their outbreak response capabilities.\n\nICRC Actions Related To The Current Event\n\nThe ICRC's operations in Nigeria are primarily concentrated on the conflict-affected North-East region, utilizing its Sub-delegations and Offices spread across the states of Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe in the North-East. The ICRC Delegation in Abuja supports regular coordination meetings among Movement members, in line with the existing Movement Cooperation Agreement, to ensure a unified approach in supporting NRCS efforts in preparedness, readiness, and response. The ICRC is aiding the NRCS in bolstering its emergency response capacity through emergency first aid teams (EFAT) through capacity building and donation of emergency kits, and personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nTogether with the IFRC, ICRC, and BRC, the NRCS has established a management committee to streamline the coordination of Movement partners' efforts for an efficient response to emergencies nationwide.\n\nOther Actors Actions Related To The Current Event\n\nGovernment has requested international Yes assistance\n\nNational authorities UN or other actors Page 7 / 18\n\nIn response to the increasing number of Lassa fever cases across multiple states, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), as the lead coordinating body, has activated the National Lassa Fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to enhance and centralize response efforts. State-level EOCs have also been activated in the affected states following a notification sent to all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe NCDC is working closely with key partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Irua Specialist Teaching Hospital, the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Red Cross, and other relevant agencies. These collaborations are essential in providing comprehensive support for the ongoing response efforts in the affected states.\n\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) assisted with fumigation and decontamination efforts in households with confirmed cases and played a key role in developing a comprehensive\n---\nplan to assess the implementation of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) in the 14 General Hospitals of Ebonyi State. The World Bank, in partnership with CoPREP, funded the IPC Guideline Development Workshop held in Bauchi State. The World Health Organization (WHO) is actively supporting response efforts in the affected states, while the Africa CDC continues to aid the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) through the national Lassa Fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to coordinate response activities at the national level.\n\nAre there major coordination mechanism in place?\n\nThe multi-sectoral incident management system for addressing Lassa fever is managed by the Public Health Emergency Operation Centers (PHEOC) at both national and state levels. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention leads at the national level, while health authorities in affected states coordinate efforts locally. The Nigerian Red Cross Society is a key member of the National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). Recognizing the Red Cross\u2019s strong grassroots presence and its capacity for community engagement, active case search, and health promotion, the Government initially requested its support to address response gaps, enhance community awareness, and promote early detection and treatment to reduce mortality rates and improve overall health. To support the Nigerian Government\u2019s intensified response, the Nigerian Red Cross Society activated interventions across all its branches, working in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health, the Nigeria CDC, and WHO. Currently, volunteers are engaged in awareness and community sensitization activities. Support will continue through the non-cost extension of the DREF to assist the government and relevant stakeholders in containing the outbreak.\n\nNeeds (Gaps) Identified Health\n\nEvolution of the Outbreak: As at 27 February week 8, 3,213 cumulative suspected cases were reported in 32 states with 573 confirmed and 108 deaths in 18 States. 18th March, epi statement shows a total of 4,726 suspected cases have been reported from 35 on 37 States including FCT, of which 766 (CFR-16.2%) have been confirmed from 27 States (and 123 LGAs) with 31 health workers infected. Latest Situation Report reveals that, for epidemiological week 27, 5 new cases were recorded in 3 States including Ebonyi. Cumulatively from week 1 to 27, 163 deaths have been recorded with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.5%. Twenty eight (28) of the 37 States have recorded at least 1 confirmed case of Lassa fever from 125 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and 32 healthcare workers infected in 27 States including the FCT. The worst affected states are; Bauchi, Taraba, Edo, Ondo, Plateau, Benue, Cross River, Rivers, Anambra, and Ebonyi States with 125 local government areas. Main hotspots remained Ondo, Edo, Bauchi, Ebonyi and recently Plateau.\n\nFactors and vulnerabilities underling to the Outbreak: One significant gap in the outbreak response is early detection, inadequate case finding due to limited surveillance structures and, late presentation of cases which led to the increase case fatality rates recorded from the reporting states. While efforts have been made to enhance the surveillance system Lassa fever, gaps still exist such as limited access to diagnostic testing, challenges in data collection, reporting, and underreporting of cases from the states. The NCDC has also pointed out that this was the peak season for Lassa fever outbreak, but due to the tension and fear of transmission and consequential deaths of healthcare workers, the community health workers are rejecting to investigate, assess, and report cases of Lassa fever. Furthermore, there is also a historical delay between the data collected at the community level and the available published reports which could hide a bigger situation.\n\nAlso, in some of the endemic states, cases of Lassa fever were recorded in LGAs that have never reported cases in the past years, with increased fatality being that they were novices to the diseases. Following the general gaps in RCCE and case finding, the NCDC requested the NS to fill the gaps in those areas. Healthcare infrastructures in Nigeria, particularly in the rural areas, lack the requisite resources and capacity to effectively manage Lassa fever cases. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), inadequate training on infection prevention and control practices has compromised the safety of healthcare workers and contributed to nosocomial transmission.\n\nAdditionally, coordination among various stakeholders involved in the outbreak response is quite suboptimal. This is due to the concurrent outbreaks of Diphtheria, Cerebrospinal Meningitis (CSM), and Lassa fever, with more attention given to diphtheria and CSM, thereby hindering the implementation of a cohesive and effective response strategy to combat the outbreak.\n\nIn many affected areas, there is lack of specialized psychosocial support services, including counselling, therapy, and support groups, leaving individuals and communities without access to needed mental health care. Most healthcare workers and responders also lack training in providing psychosocial support, including skills in active listening, empathy, and trauma-informed care.\n\nA need was identified for enhanced community engagement and active case search in response to the Lassa fever outbreak. To address\n\nPage 8 / 18\n---\nthis, Red Cross volunteers are now conducting door-to-door sensitization and active case search, referring individuals who meet the community case definition of Lassa fever to designated treatment centers. They are working with community leaders and gatekeepers to track and support sick individuals and those who may have had contact with infected persons, ensuring they are linked to appropriate care. This process is ongoing and involves close collaboration with the Disease Surveillance Notification Officer and the Ministry of Health to effectively manage and contain the outbreak.\n\nWater, Sanitation And Hygiene\n\nWater, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) play a crucial role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases like Lassa fever. Many communities in Nigeria lack access to safe and clean drinking water which impedes efforts to maintain proper hygiene practices, such as hand washing, which are essential for preventing the transmission of Lassa fever and other infectious diseases. Promoting good hygiene practices, such as regular hand washing with soap and water, is essential for preventing the spread of Lassa fever. However, gaps in hygiene promotion efforts, including limited awareness and education about proper hygiene practices, has weakened the effectiveness of preventive measures. Poor food hygiene practices, such as improper storage, handling, and preparation of food, can also contribute to the transmission of Lassa fever and other foodborne illnesses. Multimammate rats are the primary reservoir of the Lassa virus therefore, dislodging them is crucial for preventing Lassa fever outbreak. Improving food hygiene practices can help reduce the risk of Lassa infection. Implementing vector control measures, such as using traps, and maintaining proper sanitation, will also help reduce the risk of rodent infestation and transmission of the virus. Improving environmental hygiene, such as waste collection and disposal in affected communities will contribute to reducing the risk of disease transmission from poor waste management practices and overcrowded living conditions, which has created conducive breeding spaces for vectors and leading to the spread of infectious disease.\n\nCommunity Engagement And Accountability\n\nDespite efforts to raise awareness, reaching all segments of the population with accurate information about Lassa fever is still a major challenge. Limited access to educational materials, language barriers, and cultural beliefs has hindered effective communication and awareness-raising efforts. Many communities, particularly in rural areas, lack awareness of the disease, leading to delays in seeking medical care and contributing to the spread of the virus. Engaging communities in decision-making processes and empowering them to take ownership of prevention and control efforts is crucial for sustainability and effectiveness. The Red Cross will intensify efforts to ensure community involvement in identifying local priorities, designing interventions, and promoting behavioral change. RCCE strategies essential for promoting behavior change at the community level, including adopting preventive measures such as hand washing, proper food hygiene, and safe burial practices were tailored to local contexts to encourage community\u2019s adaptation and build trust. Activities aimed at building trust between communities and healthcare providers for effective communication, collaboration, and response will be integrated. Feedback from participating stakeholders will address historical or systemic issues, including perceived mistreatment or neglect by healthcare providers, cultural or religious beliefs, rumors and misinformation. This will ensure transparent communication, cultural sensitivity, participation, and an effective feedback mechanism.\n\nAny identified gaps/limitations in the assessment\n\nAlthough persons of all ages and gender are at risk of the Lassa fever infection, certain groups, such as women, children, elderly individuals, persons with disabilities, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), may face increased risks during outbreaks due to factors such as limited access to healthcare, heightened caregiving responsibilities, and barriers to information and resources. Failure to prioritize the protection and needs of these vulnerable populations can result in disparities in health outcomes and exacerbate existing inequalities. Gender disparities in access to healthcare, decision-making power, and socio-economic opportunities can impact vulnerability to infectious diseases like Lassa fever. Marginalized groups, including ethnic minorities and indigenous communities may face discrimination, stigma, and social exclusion. This operation will take into consideration the specific needs and vulnerabilities of these groups, mainstreaming inclusive approaches that prioritize the participation and empowerment of marginalized communities to ensure that response efforts are equitable and effective. Meaningful engagement with affected communities, including marginalized groups, will be implored to understand the needs, building trust, and co-designing response strategies that are responsive to the diverse needs and priorities of all community members.\n\nPage 9 / 18\n---\nOperational Strategy\n\nOverall objective of the operation\n\nThis DREF allocation aims to reduce vulnerability and Lassa fever-related deaths by supporting 1,393,856 persons affected by Lassa fever through Risk Communication and Community Engagement activities, active case finding, household-level hygiene promotion, and vector control, environmental sanitation, psychosocial support, referral and feedback mechanisms in 6 states of Ebonyi, Benue, Delta, Kaduna, Rivers, and Plateau States for 6 months.\n\nOperation strategy rationale\n\nAlthough the epidemic curve for Lassa Fever is showing a decline, the ongoing protests, violence, and curfews across several states have created new challenges that could hinder the continued success of this response. This DREF extension is therefore critical to sustaining the downward trend of the outbreak while adapting to the current socio-political realities. The unrest has added complexity to the public health efforts, requiring a more flexible and responsive approach. The NCDC still identifies challenges around the late presentation of cases, poor health-seeking behaviour due to the high cost of treatment and clinical management of Lassa fever, poor environmental sanitation conditions observed in high-burden communities, and Poor awareness observed in high-burden communities.\n\nThis extension will continue to support the Ministry of Health\u2019s (MoH) efforts in health, WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), and risk communication through the following pending activities: - Finalize the KAP survey, analyze the data, and use the results to organize round-table discussions with government stakeholders and TWG members on Lassa Fever. - Conduct post-distribution monitoring. - Continue roadshows and live call-in radio shows to enhance outreach. - Hold a lesson-learned workshop to document insights, inform the SEAP, and guide future response actions. This operation will conclude with a comprehensive lesson-learned workshop, which will not only review the Lassa Fever interventions in recent years but also focus on the specific challenges encountered and recommendations for long-term outcomes. This workshop will contribute to the development of an anticipatory action plan, emphasizing the need for a robust Early Action Protocol that is resilient to Lassa Fever emergencies in the country.\n\nNRCS volunteers will continue to monitor the security situation in their locality and adapt strategies that ensure the safety of volunteers and staff in the field. Special emphasis will be placed on engaging communities through locally trusted channels.\n\nDuring the two month no-cost extension, the National Society will continue to actively engage in the established coordination and monitoring systems with key stakeholders. Ongoing collaboration with the Ministry of Health",
