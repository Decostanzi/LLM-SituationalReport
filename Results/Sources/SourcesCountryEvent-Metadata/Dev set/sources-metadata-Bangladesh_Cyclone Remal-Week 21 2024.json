Numerical simulations, performed for two economies modeled after Madagascar and Fiji, imply that different effects dominate in each of the two economies, resulting in qualitatively different configurations of the dynamic processes of growth and distribution.",

This is because winds in the upper troposphere are stronger and exert control over the cyclone\u2019s structure, making it stable, according to Koll.\nWhen the cyclone forms from the lower to middle troposphere, it is not well organised and therefore quite difficult to predict. This is because winds in the middle troposphere are not as strong.\nTo make accurate forecasts of cyclones and generate useful early warnings in a particular region, data from all the countries in that region need to be brought together and fed into the weather models. Additionally, weather data from exclusive economic zones is currently unavailable, creating another data gap.\n[...]",

Through Complaints and Feedback Mechanisms (CFMs), affected communities share challenges regarding programs, services, and the associated humanitarian response. The anonymized data from different organizations are then combined and consolidated on a monthly basis to produce these outputs. The CFP aims to contribute towards Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and inform programming. It was developed to improve complaint management and reporting through harmonized referral standards developed directly with the Sectors and main actors responsible for responding to complaints. They are updated regularly to maintain relevancy to the current context of assistance. As per the Accountability Manifesto and CFP Referral Guidance, Site Management (SM) agencies and their partners collect and refer data to sectors and service providers at both the camp and Cox\u2019s Bazar coordination levels. The CFP reports reflect data collected through certain CFMs and the usage of these CFMs; they are not necessarily a reflection of the overall needs or satisfaction of the Rohingya living in camps. Therefore, receiving more tickets in a site or for a sector does not consequently mean that there are more needs there; rather, it might imply that there is more CFM coverage, trust in the system, or a larger population in the location where tickets are received.\nThis report is produced by Needs and Population Monitoring (NPM).

She has described the following points to interpret the forecastbased Maps:\nRainfall: According to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), climate model outputs indicate that nearnormal rainfall (light grey shaded area) is expected over Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Sylhet, Dhaka, and Rangpur divisions, as well as a few districts in the Khulna division. Conversely, belownormal rainfall (yellow shaded area) is anticipated in the remaining parts of Khulna, Barisal, and Chattogram divisions. Overall, the entire country is projected to receive near-normal to below-normal rainfall during May and June 2024. Looking ahead to July and August, the rainfall maps indicate a probability of above-normal rainfall in the northern part and upstream areas of the country. This could lead to a sudden rise in water levels in the Brahmaputra and Ganges basins.\nHeatwave: There is also a likelihood of above-normal temperatures for May and June, suggesting the potential development of a depression in May due to higher sea surface temperatures and elevated temperatures in the southern regions of the country. With the forecast of above-normal temperatures and normal to below-normal rainfall in the pre-monsoon period and the first two months (June and July) of the monsoon season for the Barind Tract, there is a risk of reduced soil moisture and potential water stress.",

        "content": "title: Research Report: Impact of Climate Change on the Migration and Displacement Dynamics of Rohingya Refugees (May 2024) \n content: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIn the disaster-prone Asia-Pacific region, particularly in South Asia, the frequency and intensity of environmental hazards, exacerbated by climate change, pose significant risks. Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, with floods being the primary driver, recorded the highest number of disaster displacements in 2022. Cox\u2019s Bazar in Bangladesh, hosting about a million Rohingya refugees, faces escalating climate-related threats, impacting camp life, safety during irregular movement, and prospects for return to Myanmar. While initial displacement from Myanmar was driven by persecution and conflicts, the dire conditions in refugee camps are increasingly influenced by climate factors, potentially contributing to onward movements to neighbouring countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.\nThe emerging impact of climate change on the displacement and migration dynamics of Rohingya is increasingly relevant. Climate change introduces additional layers of challenges to the already dire situation of the Rohingya, particularly in Bangladesh and neighbouring countries, where they seek refuge. Rohingya camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar are vulnerable to extreme weather events, with urgent climate mitigation and disaster preparedness measures needed to mitigate risks such as cyclones and landslides. Displaced populations like the Rohingya are particularly susceptible to secondary displacement due to settling in hazard-prone areas, exacerbating the risk of climate-related movement on a larger scale. The combination of food insecurity, violence, lack of livelihoods, and dwindling hope for durable solutions has led to a surge in irregular maritime movement of Rohingya across the region in recent months.\nThough conflict remains the primary driver of Rohingya displacement, climate and environmental factors along with the deteriorating conditions in the camps significantly exacerbates migration risks, particularly during perilous sea journeys. In 2023, a staggering 13% of Rohingya perished or went missing during such journeys.1 Within refugee camps, climate-induced hazards such as floods and cyclones pose additional threats, leading to internal displacement and necessitating proactive evacuation strategies. Moreover, involuntary immobility stemming from restricted mobility rights and lack of livelihood opportunities in Bangladesh compounds vulnerabilities, especially during climate-related disasters. The controversial relocation of Rohingya to Bhasan Char, touted as a safer alternative, faces scepticism due to inadequate infrastructure and emergency preparedness, raising concerns about their safety during disasters. Suspected coerced relocations and the possibility of climate-induced forced return further highlight the complexities of mobility decisions amid environmental risks. The secondary impact of environmental factors on migration decisions is evident in their function as a \"threat multiplier,\" exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities concerning livelihoods and living conditions within the camps, thereby influencing migration decision.\nDrawing from extensive data, including 4Mi survey data among 4,064 Rohingya in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand; household surveys with 200 individuals in Cox\u2019s Bazar; and interviews with 36 key stakeholders ranging from governments and international organisations to grassroots initiatives and research entities, this report sheds light on the intersection between climate change and (im)mobility for the Rohingya, aiming to provide evidence for better protection of Rohingya refugees in the context of climate change and conflict.\nSection 1 of the report presents an overview of the research methodology and contextual background. Next, Section 2 examines the impacts of climate and environmental factors on the displacement and migration of Rohingya refugees, as well as the role they play in exacerbating the existing vulnerabilities. Section 3 and Section 4 focus on the global and regional mechanisms concerning climate change and refugee protection. The report concludes with approaches towards building climate-resilient and sustainable responses for refugee protection. The summary table below encapsulates key recommendations tailored for different stakeholders",

Based in Karachi, she can be reached at murklarik@gmail.com\nTyphoid fever is one of the global life-threatening infections caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. According to the WHO, an estimated 9 million people get sick from typhoid and 110,000 people die from it every year. Typhoid continues to be a public health problem in many developing areas of Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions.\nThe disease also remains a significant public health issue in our country, particularly due to the rise of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Salmonella Typhi. According to the WHO, Pakistan has one of the highest burdens of typhoid fever globally. It has been estimated to have the highest rate of typhoid among the South Asian countries with 493.5 per 100,000 cases in 2018. Since 2016, Sindh has been dented with severe typhoid outbreaks, with Karachi and Hyderabad being the most affected areas. From November 2016 to June 2021, there were over 15,000 cases of XDR typhoid reported in Karachi alone, and 5,741 cases in other districts of Sindh province. Reports from 2017 show that 63% of typhoid cases and 70% of typhoid deaths in Pakistan were among children younger than 15 years of age. This highly prevalent disease has been burdening our healthcare system.\nA landmark development in the fight against typhoid in Pakistan is the introduction of the typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) into the routine immunisation programme. Pakistan became the first country to do so in 2019, with the goal of providing longer-term protection to children as young as six months old. The data from Pakistan shows that TCV has an efficacy of 95% against culture-confirmed Salmonella Typhi and 97% against XDR Salmonella Typhi strains. These high efficacy rates further highlight the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness and could help reduce the over-reliance on antibiotics which led to the emergence of different strains of typhoid. Dr Farah Qamar, representing Agha Khan University, played an integral role in this, resulting in her being honoured with the esteemed Tamgah-e-Imtiaz.\nNumerous socio-economic factors ranging from lack of hygiene and sanitation, poor access to safe drinking water, illiteracy, self-medication habits, vaccine hesitancy, poor living standards and inflation largely, directly or indirectly, also contribute to its spread and exacerbation.\nThe interplay of climate change, unchecked population growth, and ensuing urbanisation significantly increases the likelihood of typhoid fever. As, climate change alters temperature and precipitation patterns creating conditions favourable for the survival and proliferation of the bacteria. Uncontrolled population growth and the subsequent urbanisation strain existing water resources and sanitation infrastructure leading to inadequate waste management and sewage disposal systems. Extreme weather events such as floods and heavy rainfall further contaminates water supplies. The vaccine hesitancy majorly due to illiteracy, cultural and religious stigmas surrounding vaccination is also one of the facilitators in the spread and exacerbation of the disease. A significant portion of the population resorts to self-medication, leading to an excessive use of antibiotics. This practice greatly elevates the risk of antibiotic resistance and the emergence of new, multidrug-resistant strains of typhoid.\nThe Pakistani government, along with international partners, has implemented various measures to combat typhoid crisis. On May 13th, the Sindh government kicked off a comprehensive 13-day Typhoid Conjugate Vaccination (TCV) campaign to curb the alarming rise of typhoid cases in Karachi and Hyderabad. It aims to administer the vaccine to 8.94 million children aged nine months to 15 years in 8 districts.\nBut such campaigns can only fetch greater fruits if vaccination coverage be increased, and vaccine hesitancy be addressed. Firm steps must be taken to curb the rampant overuse of antibiotics in the country. Translational and comprehensive interventions focused on improving sanitation and hygiene, access to clean water and food safety, population control and public health education should be made. All the relevant stakeholders must be taken onboard for typhoid management.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, May 22nd, 2024.",

        "content": "title: UN peacekeepers: DW docu raises questions about vetting process \n content: A Deutsche Welle documentary has alleged that some members of the Rapid Action Battalion's intelligence wing -- which, according to the German broadcaster, has records of human rights abuses -- were deployed at UN peacekeeping missions.\nThe 20-minute-long documentary, headlined \"Torturers deployed as UN peacekeepers,\" also showed how Sri Lanka sent officers accused of war crimes during the country's civil war to peacekeeping missions.\nIt points to vetting procedures for peacekeepers, stressing that such deployments may undermine the very purpose of peacekeeping missions.\nAs of March this year, about 6,000 Bangladeshi peacekeepers were actively deployed worldwide, said the documentary.\nDW found that more than 100 Rab officers went on peacekeeping missions, 40 of them deployed after the Committee against Torture, a UN body, published a report in 2019 on alleged abuses by the security forces in Bangladesh.\nIt mentioned the names of three Rab personnel who were on peacekeeping missions. The three worked for Rab's intelligence wing with two serving as its deputy directors.\nThe documentary brought allegations against the intelligence wing saying that the unit \"runs a secret network of torture cells across Bangladesh, some of them located in safe houses, others hidden deep inside Rab's compounds\".\nIt raised questions as to how the officers could be sent to the peacekeeping missions despite being the part of the intelligence wing.\nContacted about the DW documentary, Commander Arafat Islam, director of legal and media wing of the Rab Headquarters, said the UN mission is not an issue of Rab.\n\"So, we have no observations to make,\" he told The Daily Star.\nIn the documentary, Andrew Gilmour, a former UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, said the UN's hands are seemingly tied.\nHe explained there was a time in the past when the majority of UN peacekeepers came from places like Sweden and Ireland.\nBut over the years, as the Cold War drew to a close in the early 1990s, faced with deadlier missions, Western governments increasingly started to pull their troops out of peacekeeping operations, preferring to pay for them instead.\nThe DW interviewed a political source from a western European country with inside knowledge of the workings of the UN who said democratic governments had to weigh whether they could pay a certain blood toll.\nIf soldiers deployed to UN missions returned in body bags, he explained, their governments could soon have a parliamentary inquiry on their hands. That, however, was not a problem countries like Bangladesh had to deal with, the source told DW.\nAnd the result: \"Very, very few highly trained, Westernized troops for the United Nations,\" said Gilmour.\nHe further said, \"There are almost never enough\" troops. \"So that means it's not as if the UN then can say, OK, we'll take this group because we think this country respects human rights.

Recommendations were put forth to the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs.\n\u2022 WFP assisted the Department of Women and Children Affairs in organizing the performance management committee meeting for the vulnerable women benefit (VWB) programme. Discussions were held on adopting the model of the Investment Component for Vulnerable Group Development project to align with the National Social Security Strategy. This initiative focuses on building the capacity and providing business support to vulnerable women, aiming to enhance their entrepreneurial skills and enable them to engage in economic activities.\n\u2022 In collaboration with IFPRI, WFP provided food baskets to 1,095 and cash support to 1,056 beneficiaries of the mother and child benefit programme.\nRice fortification\n\u2022 With WFP's assistance, the government distributed fortified rice to 1.7 million beneficiaries of the vulnerable women benefit programme across 165 sub-districts. Additionally, WFP facilitated direct distribution to 227,000 beneficiaries.\n\u2022 WFP and Nutrition International conducted three divisional-level quality and monitoring training sessions on rice fortification for district-level government officials. School feeding\n\u2022 The country faced its most prolonged heatwave in 75 years, leading to a nationwide closure of educational institutions for two weeks, including primary schools directly assisted by WFP\u2019s school feeding programme.\n\u2022 WFP supported the Directorate of Primary Education in compiling qualitative and quantitative data on the previous national school feeding project for submission to the government\u2019s Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED). IMED's evaluation report informed the development of the project proposal for the upcoming national school feeding project. One key finding was that schools supported by feeding programme showed higher educational outcomes, such as improved literacy and attendance rates, compared to those that were not.\nAnticipatory action\n\u2022 Before the monsoon season, WFP finalized beneficiary databases for flood-prone areas in the northeast and cyclone-prone areas in the southwestern regions as part of anticipatory action initiatives. Resilience building initiatives\n\u2022 WFP published a review of the enhancing food security and nutrition (EFSN) - livelihoods programme in Cox's Bazar, highlighting its success in enhancing food security, nutrition, and economic and social empowerment for vulnerable women. The review recommended increased government ownership, improved data management, and extended programme duration for sustainable impacts.\nRohingya refugee response\n\u2022 For the Rohingya refugees, WFP continues to try and restore the full ration. The ration size currently stands at US$10 per person per month. With a more positive funding outlook, WFP plans to increase the food ration to US$11 from June, whereas the full ration stands at US$12.5, with fortified rice added.\n\u2022 Since the beginning of 2024, WFP has begun using fortified rice in its assistance package. This initiative aims to effectively tackle malnutrition among children and boost the population's nutrient intake. Coverage is expected to reach 100 percent by June.\n\u2022 A total of 918,200 Rohingya refugees were reached through general food assistance and 235,000 most vulnerable refugees also received an additional US$3 for fresh food.\n\u2022 Malnutrition prevention and treatment services were provided at 179 sites in Cox\u2019s Bazar camps and Bangladeshi communities, as well as on Bhasan Char island, reaching 208,600 pregnant and breastfeeding women, girls and children aged 6-59 months.\n\u2022 On Bhasan Char, all Rohingya now receive their food assistance through e-vouchers as commodity vouchers have been phased out. Preparation for distribution of fortified rice distribution is underway.\n\u2022 The Republic of Korea has provided WFP its largest contribution of the year through a multi-year in-kind (rice) contribution, valued at US$13.9 million for the first year for the Rohingya refugee operation.\n\u2022 Through the resilience programme for refugees, WFP engaged 31,235 Rohingyas in skills development activities including homestead vegetable gardening, aquaculture, and upcycling. Another 16,100 refugees including 505 persons with disabilities were engaged in disaster risk reduction activities in Cox\u2019s Bazar Rohingya camps.",

        "content": "title: End-line evaluation Report: Integrated Flood Resilience Programme Phase 2 \n content: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIntroduction: The Integrated Flood Resilience Programme Phase 2 represents an intensive effort to strengthen community resilience against the devastating impacts of flooding. This initiative, undertaken in a collaborative framework involving multiple stakeholders, sought to address the multifaceted challenges posed by flood disasters through comprehensive risk management strategies, community engagement, livelihood supports, and capacity building. The programme aimed to build on the foundational efforts of its predecessor, increasing its reach and enhancing the strength of its interventions.\nPurpose & Scope: The primary objective of this evaluation is to precisely assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of the Integrated Flood Resilience Programme phase 2. This study aimed to measure the programme's success in mitigating flood risks, improving community preparedness and response, and strengthening sustainable practices that enhance resilience. The scope included a detailed examination of the programme's interventions across various domains, including risk assessment, emergency preparedness, community response mechanisms, livelihood improvement and recovery processes, with a particular focus on their long-term sustainability and impact on the target communities.\nMethodology: The evaluation adopted a mixed-methods approach, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative method to ensure a holistic inside and analysis. These included surveys administered to a wide range of stakeholders, household survey using semistructured questionnaire, Key Informant Interview (KII), Focus Group Discussions (FGD), Onside Visual Inspections (OVI), and field observations. The methodology was designed to capture a comprehensive picture of the programme impacts, outcomes, and outputs facilitating a robust evaluation. Data triangulation was employed to validate findings and enhance the credibility of the evaluation outcomes.\nRelevancy: The Integrated Flood Resilience Programme (IFRP) in Katuli and Kakua, at Tangail Sadar, Tangail addresses critical needs by focusing on agriculture, livelihood diversification, and WASH practices. With 41.3% of households engaged in agriculture and a significant (92.8%) avail sanitation and 87.8% well functioned tubewell water access during flood, the program targets the community's core vulnerabilities to floods. The emphasis on climate resilience training, where 62.0% received training, underscores the program's alignment with local environmental challenges.\nEfficiency: The program's approach to resource utilization is evidenced by the diverse income sources within communities and the strategic focus on scalable interventions like the PASSA-model homes than has proven as innovative. The engagement in raising latrines (23.0%) and improving tube-wells (17.5%) with a notable percentage of community participation in climate message dissemination (15.4%) reflects an efficient use of resources for maximum community impact.\nEffectiveness: The project demonstrated to increase in land ownership from 42.0% to 48.0% and significant income rises (38.8% HH income 50001-1000 BDT) across regions, indicating enhanced economic stability. The growth in early warning system awareness to 69.8% and actions taken by 59.0% of households before floods showcase the program's success in enhancing preparedness. The reduction in the perceived impact of river erosion from 89.0% to 47.8% and the decline in COVID-19's perceived impact from 69.0% to 12.3% further attest to its effectiveness.\nImpact: The program has made a tangible difference in the communities' economic conditions, WASH behaviors, and overall resilience. The average monthly income increased across the surveyed areas. The average monthly income in Katuli Union increased from 5445 BDT at baseline to 7753 BDT at endline. In Andhar Manik, income rose from 6538 BDT to 9520 BDT. Kauka Union, South Char Pouli experienced a modest increase from 7600 BDT to 8000 BDT, while in Goyla Hossain, income increased from 7723 BDT to 8813 BDT over the study period. Similarly, the sanitation infrastructure improved evidenced by the decrease in kaccha latrines from 61.0% to 47.2% and the increase in improved latrine types\u2014 highlights the program's positive impact. Furthermore, the active contribution of 67.8% of households in disaster emergency response indicates a substantial community empowerment and resilience enhancement.\nSustainability: The sustainability of the IFRP's is suggested by the community's belief (77.5%) in the continued benefits of disaster preparedness and resilience activities. The increase in preventive measures taken before flood (baseline 49% to endline 59%) by households and the improvement in latrine conditions from baseline 22% to endline 48.8% demonstrate a lasting change in community practices and infrastructure. However, ensuring long-term sustainability will require ongoing engagement, resource mobilization, and the integration of feedback mechanisms to adapt and respond to emerging needs and challenges.",

        "content": "title: Soaring temperatures in South Asia can put children\u2019s health in danger, UNICEF warns \n content: Statement by Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia, urging parents, caregivers and health workers to protect children from heat strokes and dehydration\nNEW DELHI/KATHMANDU, 23 May 2024 \u2013\u201cUNICEF is deeply concerned about the health and safety of babies and young children as debilitating heatwave conditions take hold in several countries.\n\u201cAcross many northern states in India, including Delhi, temperatures spiked to 43- 47 C on Sunday, according to a 5-day heatwave warning issued by the Indian Meteorological Department on 20 May. A severe heatwave is expected in Pakistan from May 23 to 27, according to an advisory from Pakistan\u2019s Meteorological Department. The Government of Punjab has closed schools from 25 - 31 May.\n\u201cThe soaring temperatures across South Asia can put millions of children\u2019s health at risk if they are not protected or hydrated. Unlike adults, children cannot adapt as quickly to temperature changes. They cannot remove excess heat from their bodies, which can lead to dehydration, higher body temperature, rapid heartbeat, cramps, severe headache, confusion, fainting and coma in young children.\n\u201cDehydration can cause heat strokes and diarrhoea. It can also result in an increased risk of chronic respiratory conditions, organ dysfunction like kidney failure, and chronic issues due to congenital defects.\n\u201cProlonged exposure to extreme temperatures can disrupt children's brain development. This can lead to difficulties with learning, memory, and concentration, potentially impacting their future opportunities. For pregnant women, who are particularly susceptible to heat, early contractions, preterm birth, delivering premature babies and stillbirths are the major risks. Babies can also die when born premature.\n\u201cChildren rely on adults to protect them from heat. UNICEF is therefore advising parents and caregivers to be extra vigilant in keeping their children hydrated through the day. To protect children from heat related illnesses, they should check regularly if the child is thirsty, sweating, feeling hot, vomiting, has a dry and sticky mouth, or headaches. Making sure that the child is clothed loosely is important.\n\u201cFor young children, ice packs, fans or misting with water can help lower their body temperature, while cold water immersion can help older children. Parents should take their child to the nearest health facility if he or she is not responding properly, has a high fever, is dizzy or breathing fast.\n\u201cThese steps are necessary given that South Asia had the highest percentage of children exposed to extreme high temperatures, compared to all other regions. According to a UNICEF analysis based on 2020 data, 76 per cent of children under 18 in South Asia \u2013 460 million \u2013 were exposed to extreme high temperatures where 83 or more days in a year exceed 35\u00b0C. In addition, UNICEF also estimated that 28 per cent of children across South Asia were exposed to 4.5 or more heatwaves per year, compared to 24 per cent globally.\n\u201cUNICEF also urges health workers to recognize symptoms of heat stress in pregnant women and children and treat them quickly. Frontline workers, parents, families, caregiversand local authorities can protect pregnant women, newborns and children and B.E.A.T. the heat by taking the following steps:\nBE AWARE of heat stress and protect yourself and your children. Take preventive measures and recognize heat stress and know what actions to take;\nof heat stress and protect yourself and your children. Take preventive measures and recognize heat stress and know what actions to take; EASILY IDENTIFY the symptoms. Recognize the symptoms of various heat-related illnesses that caregivers, communities and front-line workers need to know;\nthe symptoms. Recognize the symptoms of various heat-related illnesses that caregivers, communities and front-line workers need to know; ACT IMMEDIATELY to protect. Learn the first-aid actions that caregivers and front-line workers need to take to rebalance body heat in the short term; and\nto protect. Learn the first-aid actions that caregivers and front-line workers need to take to rebalance body heat in the short term; and TAKE to a health facility. Front-line workers, families and caregivers should recognize the symptoms of heat stress immediately, especially signs of heat stroke, and help take affected people to a health facility.\n\u201cAlready, UNICEF had raised concerns about the impact of rising temperatures on children during an oppressive heatwave in Bangladesh in April. The Government was forced to close government primary schools for several weeks impacting 30 million children. The Directorate General of Health Services, with UNICEF support, launched guidelines to respond to heat-related risks such as severe heat stress in young children.\n\u201cAccording to UNICEF\u2019s 2021 Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), children in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are at 'extremely high risk' of the impacts of climate change.

        "content": "title: Weakening insurgency, strengthening reconciliation \n content: The windswept plains and rugged mountains of Balochistan hold within them a story of resilience, a yearning for progress, and a future waiting to be written. Yet, the narrative surrounding this land has often been hijacked by small but disruptive Baloch separatist movements. A significant figure within these movements was Gulzar Imam Shambay whose capture in April 2023 marked a turning point. These groups have cast a shadow on the genuine aspirations of the Baloch people.\nShambay\u2019s capture has created a significant leadership vacuum within the Baloch Nationalist Army (BNA) that was formed out of the merger of the Baloch Republican Army (BRA) and the United Baloch Army (UBA). This absence has unleashed internal conflicts over resources and finances, severely hindering the insurgency\u2019s ability to function as a cohesive unit. BNA now appears on the verge of collapse.\nFurther fracturing the insurgency is Pakistan\u2019s offer of amnesty. The humane treatment extended to surrendered members, like Sarfaraz Bangulzai and his men, presents a tempting proposition for others. Bangulzai\u2019s defection, along with his fighters, has created a domino effect, potentially leading to a mass exodus from the BNA.\nThis critical situation presents a unique opportunity to explore possibilities of peace talks. The key question is: can a path towards a peaceful resolution be forged, or are there insurmountable obstacles?\nThe Pakistani state emphasises reconciliation and inclusivity. The aim appears to be fostering a sense of shared identity and belonging among the diverse groups within Balochistan. The Baloch are an inclusive nation striving for a peaceful and prosperous future for all its citizens. Any attempt to create division among them in the name of greater Balochistan is nothing but a designed plan to break Pakistan. India has for long been targeting Balochistan to divert the world\u2019s attention from the Indian Occupied Kashmir miseries, orchestrated by the state.\nThis narrative emphasises that Balochistan belongs to its people and that the state will not allow \u201canarchists working at the behest of foreign agencies\u201d to hijack Baloch nationalism.\nThose at the helm are completely aware of and acknowledges the grievances of the Baloch people, particularly the harm inflicted by \u201cmisguided dissidents\u201d in remote areas. To address these concerns, the government offers Baloch youth opportunities for success through improved access to quality education and employment opportunities. They also promise a share in the prosperity promised by the exploration of mineral resources in the province.\nFurthermore, the law enforcement actions and the fencing of the international border have demonstrably improved security in Balochistan. This enhanced security, coupled with the offer of reconciliation, presents a compelling reason for dissidents to lay down arms and rejoin society.\nThe onus now falls on the patriotic Baloch to deny space to these anarchists through collective action and cooperation with security forces.\nThese anarchists in the garb of the anti-state elements (ASAs) employ a multifaceted approach to exploit various issues in Balochistan \u2014 physical attacks, political manoeuvring and manipulation of humanitarian concerns \u2014 to cultivate a hostile perception of Pakistan both domestically and internationally.\nPakistan\u2019s efforts to develop Balochistan are highlighted, particularly through China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects and the development of Gwadar Port. These initiatives aim to generate revenue for the province and create jobs. However, the latest episodes of terrorist attack on these projects demonstrate the insurgents\u2019 intention to undermine the development in Balochistan. Why would projects upon which depends the progress of the province targeted if the insurgents were really fighting for the rights of the Baloch?\nThe ASAs are hindering Balochistan\u2019s progress by attacking vital infrastructure projects like dams, communication facilities and transportation networks. These actions are portrayed as inflicting real damage on the Baloch people themselves, hindering economic development and essential services.\nMoreover, the human rights activists \u2014 vociferous in their call against the illegal abduction, rightfully so \u2014 are accused of turning a blind eye to the ASAs recruitment of students into militant groups. This recruitment is a clear violation of the right to education and a tactic to exploit young people.\nThe issue of missing persons is a contentious one. The state contends that exaggerated figures are being quoted, and that many missing persons are actually hiding in militant camps. Some activists are said to have manipulated the issue for propaganda purposes.\nRecent events like the involvement of Abdul Wadood Satakzai and Karim Jan Baloch in terrorist attacks are used as examples of Baloch youth being manipulated. The families of these men were reportedly engaged by a human rights activist in a \u2018long march\u2019 seen as a propaganda campaign against Pakistan. Such actions hinder genuine efforts towards peace.\nShambay\u2019s capture, meanwhile, marks a significant juncture in the Balochistan conflict, underscoring the significance of reconciliation, improved security, infrastructural development and opportunities for the Baloch people. However, it also paints a picture of external manipulation and domestic actors hindering progress. Whether this translates into lasting peace or a temporary lull in the conflict remains to be seen.\nThis critical situation necessitates continuation of genuine efforts to address the root causes of the insurgency, ensure fair treatment of all citizens and foster a sense of justice.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, May 23rd, 2024.",

        "content": "title: Is Indian democracy a hoax? \n content: More than 80 countries, representing half of the world\u2019s population, will have elections this year. India is currently continuing its democratic experiment. India\u2019s elections for its parliament began on April 19. With over a billion eligible voters, India\u2019s elections are widely regarded as the world\u2019s largest democratic exercise\u2013 yet they are seriously unsettling. The results, which are expected to confirm Modi\u2019s reign, will be announced on June 4. Narendra Modi, the current prime minister, is running for a third term, making the fabric of the world\u2019s greatest democracy appear in contradiction. Regionalism and identity politics continue to affect electoral outcomes, while coalition politics shape governance dynamics. The election process is longer than ever, spanning six weeks, which substantially advantages Modi\u2019s party, which has extraordinarily well-stocked campaign coffers filled with oligarchs and accused of abuses of tax and investigative authorities.\nIndia navigates a difficult political environment, as this is a country that has lived through the long-term effects and vestiges of colonialism. Under the facade of development and economic growth, there are deeply entrenched inequities, religious persecution, and astonishingly persistent and pervasive poverty. It is also plagued by an outmoded caste system, gender inequality, and violence against women. Corruption has always been a major hindrance to India\u2019s economic, political, and social development.\nHow should a country\u2019s overall progress be measured? Should it be based solely on nuclear power, space exploration achievements, or the number of new billionaires produced?\nMillions of Indians remain locked in a cycle of poverty, with inadequate access to education, healthcare, or employment possibilities. Furthermore, the prevalence of corruption has a significant impact on India\u2019s economic development, with studies suggesting that it costs the nation billions of dollars each year. According to last year\u2019s World Economic Forum global competitiveness report, corruption is one of the most difficult aspects of conducting business in India, impeding investment, limiting innovation, and distorting market dynamics.\nThe BJP regime, which has been in power since 2014, has exploited these fault lines in Indian society to stir hate but gather popular nationalist and religious extremist votes. The BJP is a political offshoot of the RSS, a right-wing Hindu fundamentalist group which not only advocates racial superiority but regards Nazi Germany as an ideal. The BJP after coming to power, has started working on RSS\u2019 decades-old agenda; religiously cleansing India only for Hindus, rewriting Indian history through textbooks, even changing centuries-old names of Indian cities only because of Muslim affiliation and ultimately establishing a greater Hindu rashtra.\nThere has been a time-tested phenomenon that regimes and groups living upon hatred, violence and dividing people are like the proverbial Frankenstein monster; they invariably outgrow their creators and sympathizers, often turning on them. Indian extraterritorial assassinations in Canada and the USA are a few such incidents and a possible glimpse of the future to come.\nThere has been a great surge in hate crimes against Muslims, other minorities and even lower-caste Hindus with entrenching BJP rule over the last decade. According to Hindutva Watch, a USA-based research organization, 255 incidents of advocacy of hatred and violence targeting Muslims were recorded in the first six months of 2023.\nThe US State Department in its annual report on religious freedom expressed concerns over \u201copen calls for genocide against Muslims, lynching and other hate-fuelled violence, attacks on places of worship and home demolitions, and in some cases impunity and even clemency for those who have engaged in attacks on religious minorities\u201d in India.\nThe fascist and authoritarian measures have not been limited to religious minorities. After dismantling and crushing India\u2019s secular face through actions like revoking article 370 and 35-A in the disputed Kashmir region, now the BJP regime prior to election 2024, has been on a sprint to neutralize any political threat through coercive government force. CM Dehli Arvind Kejriwal was arrested just days before elections without any conviction or money trail, while the media was forced to stop covering the news of the biggest electoral bond scam which was linked to the ruling party.\nMoreover, top opposition party Congress complained that its bank accounts were frozen to sabotage its election campaign and the income tax department issued Congress a fine of Rs 17 billion in a case several years old. On the other hand, newspapers have refused to publish paid advertisements of opposition parties.\nAccording to the news agency Mint, opposition candidates are threatened through ED and IT to withdraw their nominations. In one such incident The Guardian wrote \u201cMukesh Dalal, from the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), won the Gujrat seat by default after every other candidate was either disqualified or dropped out of the race. It was the first time in 73 years that Surat\u2019s candidate was appointed, not elected.\u201d\nModi\u2019s victory in these elections might mean the end of a pluralistic India, which the West has hailed as an ally against China. The question arises whether the West and the whole world can afford to have a nation of a billion people and nuclear weapons led by a supremacist, hyper-nationalist and fascist right-wing regime in a volatile region like South Asia?\nThere has been a time-tested phenomenon that regimes and groups living upon hatred, violence and dividing people are like the proverbial Frankenstein monster; they invariably outgrow their creators and sympathizers, often turning on them. Indian extraterritorial assassinations in Canada and the USA are a few such incidents and a possible glimpse of the future to come.",

        "content": "title: India\u2019s Membership of the CMF: Mapping the Future of India-US Maritime Ties \n content: The Indian Navy Ship INS Talwar, operating in support of the Canadian-led Combined Task Force 150, conducted its first interdiction of illicit narcotics as a member of Combined Maritime Forces, seizing 940 kg of drugs in the Arabian Sea, April 13, 2024.\nIndia\u2019s full membership of the multinational U.S.-led Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), announced in November 2023, represents a step change in India-U.S. ties. India\u2019s membership in the force \u2014 commanded by a U.S. Navy vice admiral \u2014 actualizes a scenario where a senior Indian naval officer potentially co-leads one of the CMF\u2019s five combined task forces (CTF) with an American counterpart. India\u2019s CMF membership allows it to build the sinews required for enhanced interoperability with other members and especially the United States.\nIndia and the United States can build on this development in two ways: map avenues for enhanced interoperability, and prioritize areas where India, the United States, and other like-minded countries can deconflict.\nThe Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean\nIn the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) \u2014 a priority area for the Indian Navy (IN) \u2014 maritime partnerships are crucial to advancing India\u2019s security objectives. The IN has a history of independently undertaking missions. However, the IN\u2019s recent deployment in the Gulf of Aden to deter non-state actors underlines increased realization of the importance of the IN to work closely with other maritime powers. To this end, in mid-April, the IN conducted its first-ever mission operating under a foreign flag. In its first CMF mission, the IN interdicted the narcotics trade under the CTF-150, which is led by the Canadian Navy.\nRoadmap\nIndia\u2019s CMF membership allows it to further collaborate with other maritime powers beyond exercises. India and the United States can collaborate on two things specifically:\nMapping Avenues for India-U.S. Interoperability\nIndia-U.S. ties have transformed over the last two decades. Defense trade has \u201cemerged as a central facet\u201d and bilateral military exercises are regularly held. This progression in ties is limited by the lack of greater interoperability. Defined as the ability to \u201croutinely act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve tactical, operational and strategic objectives,\u201d interoperability was primarily restricted to exercises, with the two states conducting joint patrols with other partners in recent years.\nIndia\u2019s CMF membership enables it to strengthen interoperability in ways that would be difficult to undertake even a decade ago. Both states have espoused a commitment to \u201cenhance interoperability,\u201d and as a member of the CMF, India has a say in the force\u2019s operational affairs.\nPer the U.S. Army, the levels of interoperability progress from deconfliction to compatible to integrated. For India and the United States to move from a deconflicted state to a more compatible one, the two states should consider mapping avenues where interoperability can be enhanced.\nGiven Indian sensitivities, it would be politically most feasible for both partners to focus on operations against non-state actors. The mission interdicting narcotics that the IN conducted in mid-April is a good example. This can be expanded upon by focusing on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR), Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, and counter-piracy operations \u2014 all activities that fall, or can be placed, within the ambits of the five CTFs. With a say in the CMF\u2019s operational affairs, the IN can push the conversation on CTFs\u2019 mandates, aligning them with the aims identified in the IN\u2019s 2015 Maritime Security Strategy, including an expanded area of the maritime domain, an emphasis on key maritime chokepoints, and by focusing on non-traditional threats like climate change and natural disasters.\nPrioritizing Areas for Deconflicting\nDeconflicting is a first, albeit crucial step, in building interoperability. By identifying areas where the IN can lead, India and maritime partners can judiciously redirect resources in the IOR. When the IN and other navies, including the U.S. Navy, responded to the 2004 tsunami with HADR missions, deconflicting improved coordination between different navies, leading to trust-building. While that response was reactive, as a member of the CMF, India and other partners can think proactively about areas where they can deconflict.\nOne tangible avenue is through capacity building. India, the United States, and other countries regularly help littoral states with capacity building, and CT-151 and \u2013153 within the CMF are mandated for the same. Given India\u2019s experience with capacity building, it can look to expand the number of states where it helps with capacity building, by focusing on African maritime nations, and deconflict with other CMF partners that currently undertake such exercises. Developing capacity is instrumental in building regional leadership, trust-building, and crucially, is aligned with India\u2019s stated goal of being a \u201cnet security provider.\u201d\nAshley Tellis notes that for the United States., defense cooperation is fundamentally about \u201cmilitary interoperability.\u201d Given that just a decade ago, the term \u201cinteroperability\u201d was \u201canathema to Indian officials,\u201d India\u2019s CMF membership ought to be seen against the backdrop of evolving India-U.S. ties and the IN\u2019s increased presence and leadership in the IOR. With India\u2019s increasing ambitions in the maritime domain, strengthening interoperability with the United States and like-minded maritime powers, and deconflicting where possible as outlined above, is crucial. No nation can go it alone in providing regional maritime security, and while one ought to recognize and laud India\u2019s CMF membership, the IN should further chalk out avenues for enhancing interoperability.\nThis article was originally published on New Perspectives on Asia from the Center for Strategic and International Studies and is reprinted with permission.",

It is very likely to cross Bangladesh close to southwest of Mongla by 10 pm of 26 May as a Severe Cyclonic Storm with wind speed of 110-120 gusting to 135 km/h and up to 400-450 mm of rain in 24 hours, particularly affecting Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali and Bhola with varying rainfall across the country.\n\nThe approaching severe cyclonic storm poses a significant threat to districts of Khulna and Barishal division, with the potential for high tidal waves and heavy rainfall.\n\nA special alert has been issued for the Cox's Bazar Rohingya camp due to the forecasted heavy rainfall and gusty winds accompanying the impending storm, heightening the risk of landslides. This poses a significant threat to the nearly 1 million Rohingya people residing in the world's largest refugee camp, exacerbating existing challenges from a recent fire incident1 and last year's ration cuts.2\n\nOngoing needs assessments will update and determine the extent of potential damage by the cyclone. Latest estimates placed 8.4 million people within the cyclone\u2019s direct path at wind speeds of 92- 117 km/h.3\n\n1 On 24 May, a fire broke out in Cox's Bazar Rohingya camps, resulting in over 200 shelters being affected and impacting approximately 4,000 people.\n\nRation cuts refer to the transfer value for general food assistance programme.\n\n\u2022 The cyclone is the latest crisis, exacerbating existing hardships faced by vulnerable Bangladeshis residing in coastal regions. According to the latest April 2024\u202fIntegrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report 14.6 million individuals in Bangladesh are WFP is stepping up to respond in Bangladesh and Myanmar; WFP experiencing acute food insecurity, with over 300,000 provided 28,000 Bangladeshis in Teknaf cash before the cyclone classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).

It is suggest that an additional 2 million individuals may resuming enter regular phases assistance 3 and 4 to of Bangladesh. food insecurity by October, with the heightened risk of cyclones in 2024 attributed to the El Ni\u00f1o effect. \u2022 The government is leading the preparedness and response activities, including organizing coordination meetings, formulating early warning messages through Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP), deploying volunteers, prepositioning relief items at the local level using the government\u2019s disaster management fund, managing cyclone shelters, and evacuating at-risk communities. In support of these efforts, WFP will continue to work closely with the government, especially if they request or welcome assistance from the UN.\n\nWFP Preparedness and Response\n\nIn anticipation of the cyclone, WFP, UN and NGO partners have already begun meeting with local authorities in potentially affected areas and requested all WFP standby partners to be at-the- ready for emergency response.\n\nWith generous support from Germany, through WFP\u2019s Anticipatory Action Trust Fund, WFP activated\n\nNAWG_Cyclone Remal_Situation Overview and Anticipatory Impact Analysis Cyclone Remal: Version 02 (Issued at 17:00 BST, 26 May 2024)\n---\nanticipatory action and provided forecast-based cash assistance of BDT 5,000 (US$43) per household to 30,000 families (about 150,000 people) across 11 upazilas of five districts: Patuakhali, Satkhira, Barguna, Khulna and Bhola. Cash assistance was distributed through digital transfers to vulnerable households before the cyclone hits. This enables them to prepare by purchasing essential supplies such as dry food, medicines, food for infants, and cattle feed. Additionally, they can secure their homes by purchasing ropes and other necessary items and arrange for boats or alternative transportation for evacuation, ensuring their safety and resilience in preparation for the impending cyclone. Actions also involve disseminating early warning messages and coordinating with the CPP and local government to evacuate at-risk communities. WFP has coordinated closely with the START Network to check beneficiary database and prevent any duplication of AA beneficiaries in intervention areas.\n\nAs part of its preparedness activities, WFP has participated in Disaster Management Committee (DMC) meetings at various administrative levels to ensure a more coordinated approach to preparedness and response. WFP's cooperating partners are also assisting Cyclone Shelter Management Committees (SMCs) to ensure that shelters are well-managed and properly arranged. Additionally, WFP is supporting volunteers from the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) in disseminating early warning messages through community engagement and miking as well as managing cyclone shelters, with a particular focus on involving women volunteers.\n\nWFP trained CPP volunteers to conduct household- level orientations and educate families on cyclone preparedness using a checklist of 14 specific activities assigned to family members to ensure comprehensive preparedness actions.\n\nIn Cox\u2019s Bazar, thanks to Norway\u2019s contribution, nearly 200 mt of fortified biscuits are prepositioned in Madhuchara hub, ready to be deployed in case rapid response is required. WFP camp retailer partners have emergency stocks of rice, oil and lentils for at\n\nPhotos: Preparations in South-western region for Cyclone Remal \u00a9 WFP / Cooperating partners\n\nleast a week available in their warehouses for rapid response.\n\nWFP is working to mitigate transport and telecommunications disruptions. On Bhasan Char island, which is located along the cyclone\u2019s path and home to some 35,000 Rohingya refugees, a stock of 220 mt of assorted food is stored in the Government warehouse, ready for immediate deployment. All three WFP retailers will maintain a minimum two- week food stock to ensure monthly entitlements are met despite supply disruptions. Additionally, 20 mt of fortified biscuits are stored in the Government warehouse for emergency use, with another 22 mt available in WFP-supported learning centers for distribution. With private donation raised through WFP\u2019s ShareTheMeal app, WFP and its partners are on standby, equipped to provide 6,000 hot meals daily.\n\nPrior to the cyclone making landfall, WFP put systems in place to serve the broader humanitarian community to store and transport humanitarian aid, and to facilitate connectivity.\n\nWFP is on the ground and will be conducting rapid needs assessments, in coordination with OCHA and other humanitarian actors, to quantify the damage and determine the necessary support immediately after the cyclone's landfall.",

        "content": "title: Mr. President, Members of the Security Council, \n content: As delivered\n\nTOR WENNESLAND UN SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS SECURITY COUNCIL BRIEFING ON THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nMr. President, Members of the Security Council,\n\n20 May 2024\n\nThank you for inviting me to address the Council on recent developments in Rafah, where the situation is becoming increasingly desperate and dangerous for the already besieged population.\n\nRegrettably we face yet another precipice of further catastrophe in Gaza amid stalled talks between the parties to secure the release of all hostages held in Gaza and a ceasefire to provide much needed relief to the civilian population. Just two weeks ago negotiations were ongoing in Cairo with the support of Egypt, Qatar and the United States, however, these talks ended on 9 May without agreement.\n\nI urge the parties to redouble all efforts and return to the negotiating table immediately and in good faith. I reiterate the United Nations\u2019 full support to the tireless efforts by the mediators to achieve this goal and we stand ready to support implementation of such a deal. If talks do not resume, I fear for the worst for the beleaguered and terrified civilians in Rafah, for the hostages held in unimaginable conditions for more than 225 days, and for an overstretched humanitarian operation that remains on the brink inside the Strip.\n\nMr. President,\n\nMy colleague from OCHA will brief in greater details on the dire humanitarian situation in and around Rafah momentarily but allow me to highlight some critical observations from the ground.\n\nSince the first week of May, the security situation in Rafah has rapidly worsened as the IDF operations and military maneuvers in and around the city have intensified.\n\nOn 5 May, Hamas launched mortars and rockets at IDF soldiers massed on the Israeli side of Karem Abu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing, killing four IDF soldiers and wounding ten. IDF tank shelling and a series of airstrikes in Rafah killed at least 19 Palestinians on the same day, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The following day, the IDF said that it would operate with \u201cextreme force\u201d against Hamas in eastern Rafah and ordered approximately 100,000 Palestinians to immediately evacuate to what it described as an \u201cexpanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi.\u201d Since operations began, more than 800,000 people have been displaced from Rafah to Mawasi, Khan Younis and Deir al Balah amid daily IDF airstrikes in Rafah, killing dozens of Palestinians. Hamas has continued to fire rockets indiscriminately from Gaza towards Israel.\n\nThese events have had a significant impact on humanitarian operations and access.\n\nThe so-called expanded humanitarian area in al-Mawasi lacks adequate shelter, food, water and sewage infrastructure and crossings for the entry of humanitarian goods have already been directly affected.\n---\nAs delivered\n\nIn the wake of the Hamas strike on 6 May, Israeli authorities closed Karem Abu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing for three days. The following day, the IDF said it had established \u201coperational control of the Gazan side of the [Rafah] crossing,\u201d and closed the crossing for the movement of goods and people. The Rafah crossing with Egypt remains closed.\n\nIn addition, active hostilities and IDF operations continue to render nowhere safe in Gaza, including for humanitarian workers. Just last week a staff member of the UN Department of Safety and Security from India died and another staff member was seriously injured when their UN vehicle was struck as they travelled to the European Hospital in Rafah Governorate. This brings to a total 193 UN staff who have been killed in Gaza since the start of hostilities. Humanitarian movements must be made safer.\n\nMr. President,\n\nI am deeply concerned that the current trajectory \u2013 including the possibility of a larger-scale operation \u2013 will further undermine efforts to scale-up the entry of humanitarian goods and their safe distribution to desperate civilians.\n\nThe opening of the Zikim or Erez West crossing in Gaza\u2019s north, including for the entry of humanitarian relief items arriving via Ashdod and from Jordan, is a welcome development, as is the entry for the first time of humanitarian supplies through Cyprus via the US-built floating pier on 18 May.\n\nHowever, I reiterate, that more aid is needed to meet the enormous scale of the needs in Gaza and there is no substitute for the full and increased operation of existing land crossings.\n\nThe UN continue to engage with all concerned parties, including the Israeli authorities, to address these and other safety concerns, including an improved humanitarian notification system. Mr. President,\n\nThe Secretary-General, alongside numerous international partners and concerned neighbors, including Egypt, have voiced serious objection to a military operation in the city of Rafah amid clear indications of its devastating consequences for the civilian population.\n\nSaving lives and addressing the critical needs in Rafah and Gaza more broadly must remain our immediate priority and I reiterate the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a humanitarian ceasefire.\n\nAt the same time, we must not lose sight of the risks that these immediate threats pose to prospects for a resolution of this conflict and for longer term peace and stability in the region.\n\nI am very concerned that the failure to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and a large-scale military operation in Rafah exacerbates the risk of escalating regional tensions. Since the start of hostilities on 7 October, I have engaged continuously in the region, including in Lebanon, to avert a wider spillover and I \u2013 in support of the Secretary-General \u2013 will continue these efforts.\n\nI also reiterate that there can be no long-term solution in Gaza that is not fundamentally political.\n\nThe new Palestinian Government, with eight ministers from Gaza, represents an important opportunity to support tangible steps towards unifying Gaza and the occupied West Bank politically, economically, administratively.\n---\nAs delivered\n\nThe international community should provide support to the new Government to address its fiscal challenges, strengthen its governance capacity and prepare it to reassume its responsibilities in Gaza and, ultimately, govern the whole of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Palestinian Authority must also be an integral part of planning for Gaza\u2019s recovery and reconstruction.\n\nThe devastation and misery of the past seven months have reinforced a simple truth. Palestinians and Israelis can no longer wait to establish a viable political horizon to end the conflict and establish a two-State solution. Day after day we are witnessing the deadly consequences of inaction. Now is the time to lay the foundations for a better future for Palestinians, Israelis and the broader region. The UN will continue to support all such efforts.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "title: Implications of President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s death \n content: EBRAHIM Raisi was an Iranian politician who served as the eighth president of Iran from 2021 until his death in a helicopter crash on 19 May 2024. He held several significant positions during his career, including being the Chief Justice of Iran and a member of the Assembly of Experts. Raisi was a hardline cleric and close to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His presidency was marked by domestic turmoil and mounting tensions with the West. The death of Ebrahim Raisi has significant implications both within Iran and globally. Raisi was highly respected and popular in Iran. His death leaves a void in the country\u2019s political landscape. He was often cited as the favourite to succeed Ali Khamenei as Iran\u2019s supreme leader.\nThe next President will play a crucial role in shaping Iran\u2019s domestic and foreign policies. Raisi\u2019s death comes at a testing time for the region. Israel\u2019s war against Hamas (allegedly backed by Iran) adds complexity to the situation. It is unlikely to significantly alter how Iran deals with Gaza or the West, but the aftermath will be closely watched. World leaders expressed condolences. China called it a \u201cgreat loss,\u201d and Egypt expressed solidarity with Iran. The European Union offered sincere condolences; Pakistan declared a day of mourning while India also mourned Raisi\u2019s contribution to bilateral relations. The demise of the Iranian President could have economic implications too. Iran is a major crude oil producer. Raisi\u2019s death may affect oil prices and market volatility until his successor takes office. Iran\u2019s next President will face several significant challenges. There could be an economic crisis since Iran\u2019s economy is currently grappling with inflation, unemployment and currency devaluation. The next president must address these pressing economic issues to stabilize the country\u2019s financial situation. Additionally, Iran faces international sanctions that impact trade, investment and access to global markets.\nRaisi\u2019s successor will have to deal with domestic dissent and unrest because widespread protests have increased in recent years. The new President will need to find effective ways to address citizens\u2019 grievances and promote social stability. Striking a balance between security measures and civil liberties will be crucial for maintaining order. The Foreign Minister of Iran died along with his President; both have left behind challenges for their successors. Iran\u2019s relations with the West, particularly the United States, remain strained. The President must skilfully navigate nuclear negotiations, regional conflicts and international alliances. Given the tension in the Middle East, Iran\u2019s role in the region requires careful diplomacy. Last month, an Israeli airstrike targeted the Iranian Consulate in Damascus, killing Major General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior Quds Force commander and seven other Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers. Iran retaliated with missile and drone strikes against Israel, while Israel responded with a series of missile strikes on Iranian military sites. Thus, improving relations with other countries is a complex endeavour, but some steps that can improve better relations with others include engaging in open communication and dialogue with other nations. Diplomatic efforts can lead to understanding, cooperation and conflict resolution. Fostering relationships through diplomatic channels, embassies and international organizations. Identifying shared interests and areas of cooperation. Collaborating on issues such as climate change, trade, security and public health. Joint projects and initiatives can build trust and strengthen ties. Cultural exchanges, educational programmes and tourism promote understanding and bridge cultural gaps. Encouraging interactions between citizens of different countries to create goodwill. International organizations like the United Nations play a crucial role in mediation. Economic ties often lead to improved relations. Trade agreements and investment can benefit both parties. Economic interdependence reduces the likelihood of conflict. Consistent actions and adherence to agreements build trust over time. Demonstrating reliability and commitment strengthens bilateral relations. Improving international relations requires patience, persistence and a willingness to find common ground. There is another major challenge that Iranian leadership faces\u2014the ongoing pandemic continues to impact Iran\u2014the next president must prioritize effective vaccination campaigns, strengthen healthcare infrastructure and implement robust public health measures. The question that is arising is \u201cWho will be President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s successor? When a president dies in office in Iran, the constitution stipulates that the First Vice President assumes power for a 50-day interim period, subject to approval by the supreme leader. Following this period, a new presidential election is held. Mohammad Mokhber, the First Vice President, will serve as the Acting President until elections take place. The election process will be expedited, with Guardian Council vetting all candidates. They will disqualify those deemed unacceptable, ensuring a contest between a hardliner and a conservative. Different government factions will vie for the supreme leader\u2019s favour. The Guardian Council plays a crucial role in Iran\u2019s elections, reviewing and approving or disqualifying candidates running for various offices, including the presidency. They assess candidates\u2019 qualifications, loyalty to Islamic principles and adherence to the Constitution. The council consists of 12 members, six of whom are appointed by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei and six by Parliament (Majlis). The head of the judiciary is also a member. The council evaluates candidates based on their religious piety, commitment to the Islamic Republic and alignment with the principles of the 1979 Revolution. If a candidate is deemed unfit, they are disqualified from running. The Guardian Council aims to maintain the Islamic character of the government. By vetting candidates, it ensures that only those who align with its vision participate in elections. Raisi\u2019s presidency signalled the rise of hardliners, sidelining conservatives. However, there isn\u2019t a clear hardline favourite yet.\nMohammad Qalibaf, Parliament Speaker and former presidential candidate, is a likely conservative contender. He has been a prominent figure in Iranian politics for 25 years, despite failing in two previous presidential campaigns. Raisi\u2019s passing creates uncertainty in Iran\u2019s leadership and has broader geopolitical implications, but the full impact remains to be seen. The next Iranian President faces a complex web of economic, social and geopolitical challenges. The ability to address these issues will significantly shape Iran\u2019s future.\n\u2014The writer, Retired Group Captain of PAF, is author of several books on China.\nEmail: [email protected]",

Ali said politicians in the region have made promises to provide relief for them, including during the current election, but little has changed for his family. For now, they contend with being displaced for large parts of the year.\n\u201cWe need some sort of a permanent solution,\u201d Ali said. \u201cIn the last few years, it\u2019s only a short time after we recover from flood damages that we have to be ready to face another flood.\u201d\nMonuwara Begum cleans utensils before leaving her family's house that is submerged with floodwaters in Sandahkhaiti, a floating island village in the Brahmaputra River in Morigaon district, Assam, India, Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023.

And while local governments have talked about it, only a few river islanders have been offered land rights in the state.\nWhen The Associated Press met Ali and his family last year, they were relocating because of incessant rain that had flooded their island home. Now, during the dry season, Ali and his family cultivate red chile peppers, corn and a few other vegetables in their small farm on the island.\nLike most other islanders, farming is their livelihood: An estimated 240,000 people in the Morigaon district of the state \u2014 where some of the river islands, known as Chars, are located \u2014 are dependent on fishing and selling produce like rice, jute and vegetables from their small farms.\nYaad Ali smokes in his house in Sandahkhaiti, a floating island village in the Brahmaputra River in Morigaon district, Assam, India, Thursday, April 25, 2024.

Cooking, eating and sleeping, even as the river water rises. But sometimes the water engulfs their home, forcing them to flee with their belongings.\n\u201cWe leave everything and try to find some higher ground or shift to the nearest relief camp,\u201d Monuwara Begum, Ali\u2019s wife, said last year. The relief camps are unhygienic and there\u2019s never enough space or food, Ali said, and \u201csometimes we get only rice and salt for days.\u201d\nYaad Ali, left, and his wife Monuwara Begum, center, and their son Musikur Alam leave their submerged house in Sandahkhaiti, a floating island village in the Brahmaputra River in Morigaon district, Assam, India, Tuesday, Aug. 29, 2023.

They move back to their homes, tend to their farms, and are able to make a living selling the produce they harvest.\nIndia, and Assam state in particular, is seen as one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable regions to climate change because of more intense rain and floods, according to a 2021 report by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi-based climate think tank.\nChildren play inside a makeshift temporary shade where farmers take rest in Sandahkhaiti, a floating island village in the Brahmaputra River in Morigaon district, Assam, India, Thursday, April 25, 2024.

        "content": "title: Humanitarian funding: A crisis within a crisis \n content: Every morning, I wake up with a sense of dread as my email is already flooded with requests from different stakeholders\u2014government authorities and humanitarian aid partners \u2014 seeking assistance for displaced populations. The stark reality of dwindling global humanitarian funds breeds this dread. If you ask humanitarians how things are going these days, they, too, will tell you they are facing a serious problem: a funding shortfall. There are too many ongoing crises around the world with insufficient funds to help those in need. Regrettably, a quick resolution to this funding crisis remains elusive.\nEach year, the United Nations appeals to its member states for funds to respond to global crises and provide lifesaving assistance, including food, sanitation, healthcare, and shelter. In 2023, approximately 128 million people received lifesaving assistance. However, due to funding shortages, humanitarian organisations fell short of reaching their target, assisting less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support. Response plans for 2024 are ultra-prioritised, with extremely tightened budgets to address the most urgent needs. UN agencies have already been forced to reduce food assistance in Bangladesh, Syria, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Afghanistan, and Yemen. This year, humanitarian efforts aim to reach nearly 184.1 million out of the 302.2 million people who are in need of assistance and protection in 73 countries.\nThe consequences of these funding shortages are deeply troubling. In Afghanistan, 10 million people lost access to food assistance between May and November last year. This loss worsens food insecurity, raising the risk of malnutrition and hunger-induced issues. In Myanmar, over half a million people endure inadequate living conditions, lacking essentials like shelter, water, and sanitation. Yemen faces a dire situation, with over 80 percent of the targeted people having no access to proper water and sanitation facilities. In Nigeria, only 2 percent of the women in need of essential sexual and reproductive health services and gender-based violence prevention received it in 2023, leaving them vulnerable to severe health risks and increased violence. These examples underscore the urgent need for consistent and sufficient funding to support global humanitarian efforts. Without adequate resources, the ability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services to those in crisis is severely challenged, perpetuating cycles of suffering and worsening existing emergencies. This funding shortfall is causing a crisis within a crisis.\nConflicts, climate emergencies and collapsing economies are wreaking havoc in communities around the world, resulting in catastrophic hunger, massive displacement and disease outbreaks. If the current trends in displacement due to protracted complex conflicts with a high risk of relapse, urbanised conflict, and growing inequality continue, the gap between needs and response will continue to widen.\nThis underlines the urgent need for more proactive and innovative responses. Business as usual is not a solution now, as relying solely on humanitarian efforts to respond to emergencies falls short in the long term. Therefore, it is crucial that we harness and redesign the way we do business. To initiate this transformation, we must set forth an ambitious agenda and timeline for a total change. The starting point is a fundamental shift away from crisis response towards crisis prevention, focusing on reducing vulnerabilities and addressing the root causes of displacement.\nWe need to move beyond institutional silos to materialise the ambition. Humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding actors should work towards collective outcomes based on comparative advantages. As we work to ensure that humanitarian needs are met in a principled manner, investing in development and peacebuilding initiatives that target these root causes and prevent crisis from escalating is paramount. Development actors should play a pivotal role in this transformation, concentrating on initiatives like improving infrastructure, education, healthcare, and economic recovery in vulnerable regions. By addressing underlying issues such as poverty, inequality, and resource scarcity, the factors that often lead to humanitarian crises can be mitigated. This approach requires strategic planning, coordination, and steadfast commitment from governments, international organisations, and stakeholders.\nFurthermore, prioritising conflict resolution is essential. The international community must pledge to intensify efforts to pursue political solutions to conflicts. Countries must work with greater determination to prevent conflicts and reduce vulnerability. The 302.2 million people affected by crises and destitution must be at the centre of our collective decision-making on humanitarian actions, development, peace and security.\nTo effectively reduce vulnerability at its core, donors should shift away from funding isolated short-term projects aimed at quick fixes like a band-aid, and instead prioritise funding initiatives that deliver collective, long-term outcomes. Localisation is key in this approach, as emphasised in the Grand Bargain, an agreement on humanitarian reformed that was agreed on in the World Humanitarian Summit 2016, that 48 countries and aid agencies are party to. It is essential that we collaborate closely with local actors, ensuring that our efforts empower them rather than replace them. This collaborative effort is vital to get ahead of the curve if we measure success in terms of reducing vulnerability and enhancing local capacity.\nMoving towards these changes may indeed require stepping out of comfort zones and embracing new approaches. As the funding gap widens, the focus should be on ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches those in need efficiently. This approach maximises the impact of assistance while maintaining accountability to affected populations. Donors should enhance the effectiveness of their support by offering more flexible funding mechanisms that allow implementing partners to respond rapidly to evolving needs on the ground. This may involve committing to multi-year funding and reducing restrictions on fund allocation. Implementing partners should prioritise maximising direct impact on affected populations by minimising financial intermediaries, overhead costs and administrative expenses, optimising resource allocation towards frontline services and assistance.\nTanbir Uddin Arman has been extensively involved in the management and coordination of humanitarian assistance to conflict-affected populations in South Asia, and Central and East Africa.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\nAlmost 970 million Indians are voting in general elections amid sweltering heat and unpredictable weather extremes exacerbated by human-caused climate change, leading to loss of livelihood, forced migration and increasingly difficult living conditions for millions across the country.\nVoters are looking for politicians who promise relief, stability and resilience to the wide-ranging and damaging effects of a warming climate. In their election manifestos, India\u2019s top political parties, including the governing Bharatiya Janata Party and the main opposition, the Congress party, have made multiple promises to act on climate damage and reduce emissions of planet-heating gases.\nBut there has been little talk about climate change on the campaign trail.\n\u201cClimate change is still not among the headlines during these elections despite its obvious impact on millions of Indian lives,\u201d said Anjal Prakash, author of multiple United Nations climate reports.\nThe Indian subcontinent \u2014 surrounded by ocean on three sides and the Himalayan ranges to its north \u2014 is vulnerable to sea level rise, severe storms, heavy floods and melting glaciers. It's also experienced extreme heat spells and severe drought as global average temperatures climb. A report by the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment said India experienced extreme weather on nearly 90% of the days last year.\nHere's a look at how the effects of climate change are influencing voters.\nEXTREME HEAT AND LONGER DROUGHTS IN WESTERN AND CENTRAL INDIA\nVaibhav Maske's millet farm was dry to the bone in early May, even though he dug three borewells 600 feet deep looking for water.\nThe 25-year-old lives in Marathwada, one of the most acutely affected heat and drought-prone regions in western Maharashtra state, and farmers there say the current summer is the worst major drought in almost a decade. But politicians haven\u2019t been paying attention.\n\u201cPoliticians are only talking about religion and caste. No one is talking about the environment or farmers issues,\" said Maske. \"They are saying Prime Minister Modi is giving money to farmers, that\u2019s good. But at the same time, the taxes are so high on everything including our farm equipment, so how can we make ends meet this way?\u201d\nSince February 2019, a federal government scheme transfers $70 to around 100 million farmers a year to supplement their income. But Maske said it's of little use as farm expenses like water, fertilizers and farm gear now cost him up to $180 a month.\nInstead, Maske said local and federal governments need to prioritize providing a water source for farming. \u201cThey need to dig canals or divert some water from rivers in nearby areas, so we have some steady supply of water. No one has done anything about this,\" he said.\nSTRONGER AND MORE FREQUENT CYCLONES FOR COASTAL REGIONS\nIndia\u2019s eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the country's coast. Last year was India's deadliest cyclone season in recent times, killing 523 people and costing an estimated $2.5 billion in damage.\nRoxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said their studies found that \u201cfloods have increased threefold since the 1950s and cyclones have increased by 50% since the 1980s.\u201d\nIt's making disasters a political focal point for the regions worst affected by them.\nAround 25,000 people in the Ennore neighborhood in Chennai planned to boycott the Indian general elections in part due to lack of government support post Cyclone Michaung, which devastated the eastern coasts of southern India in December 2023.\n\u201cPoliticians just come asking for votes making promises,\" said Subhashini Ravi, a 37-year-old resident of Ennore. \u201cOnce elections are over, they just disappear.\u201d\nStill, the boycott was called off at the last minute after the regional government said it would address the issues post-election.\nIssues related to religion, caste and employment still determine most Indians' political preferences, but Koll said that at local levels, climate is playing a role when \u201cthe entire community is affected.\u201d\nLocal and federal authorities have managed to adapt partially to increasingly frequent cyclones by evacuating coastal residents in time and drastically reducing loss of life. But as cyclones get more intense, many residents like Ravi are still worried for the future.\nUNPREDICTABLE AND INCREASED FLOODING IN ASSAM\nThousands in Assam state are dependent on fishing and selling produce like rice, jute and vegetables from their small farms on floating river islands in the Brahmaputra River, known locally as Chars.\nWhen it floods, residents of Char islands often row in makeshift rafts to dry land, and return once it subsides. But floods are now more devastating and unpredictable because of climate change, locals say, making it harder to stay on the islands.\nResidents are wary nothing will change no matter who they vote for.\n\u201cAll the politicians promise to solve problems related to flooding but after elections are over, no one cares about it,\u201d said Yaad Ali, a 55-year-old farmer in Sandahkhaiti, a village located on a small river island in north eastern India\u2019s Assam state.\nBadruddin Ajmal, the leader of the All India United Democratic Front, a regional party in Assam and the main opposition in the state, has repeatedly talked about providing for long term relief from flooding during his campaigns this election.\nLeaders of national parties such as the BJP \u2014 also in power in Assam state \u2014 and the Congress Party have largely ignored the issue during their election campaigning in Assam this year.\nConsidered one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable regions to climate change according to a 2021 report, Ali said the lack of political will is only making life harder.\nMELTING GLACIERS AND INTENSE RAIN IN THE HIMALAYAS\nIn Shimla city in India\u2019s mountainous Himachal Pradesh state, apple farmer Sanjay Chauhan recalls the deadly rainfall in the region last year that killed 428 people and broke local rainfall records.\n\u201cI had not seen anything like this,\u201d Chauhan said. He incurred $5,000 worth of damage to his orchards in the heavy rain, and property damage across the state was estimated at $1.42 billion. \u201cMany issues were raised after the devastation last year but the government and political leaders are only providing temporary relief,\u201d he said.\nRising global temperatures means more water evaporates in the heat which is then dumped as heavy rain. Fast melting glaciers in the region that scientists say could lose 80% of their volume by the end of the century means the Himalayan region and its people are at further risk.\nBut climate-related concerns like heavy flooding and melting glaciers have not featured in the election campaigns in the state. Most political speeches in Himachal Pradesh have focused on issues related to corruption, price rise and unemployment, regardless of party allegiance.\nMeanwhile, Chauhan said, locals are \u201cworried about what the monsoons will bring this year.\"\nOther regions also suffered heavy losses in terms of lives, property and farmland due to heavy rain \u2014 including the neighboring state of Uttarakhand, Delhi and most northern and western Indian states.\n\u201cWhat we need are long term strategies\" to combat extreme weather events, Chauhan said.\n___\nAssociated Press journalist Anupam Nath in Gauhati, India, contributed to this report.\n___\nSibi Arasu on X at @sibi123 ___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "content": "title: \u2018It\u2019s in our rivers and in our cups. There\u2019s no escape\u2019: the deadly spread of salt water in Bangladesh \n content: Shadows dance across large, concrete chambers while the sound of dripping water echoes in the distance. A rusty metal staircase leads up to an empty water tower overlooking Bangladesh\u2019s mighty Rupsha River. This water treatment plant was once a beacon of hope for the community; today the site lies abandoned, the only sign of life the daily activity of its resident caretaker, Sayed Ahmed.\nCommissioned by the local government division for rural development to recycle contaminated water, the plant on the outskirts of the city of Khulna was designed to supply fresh water to 5,000 people. When construction began in 2005, Ahmed was offered employment as a security guard.\nView image in fullscreen Ahmed works as a security guard at the local wastewater treatment plant\n\u201cI was excited when I first got the job,\u201d he says. \u201cThe new water plant was the talk of the town and everyone was hopeful about the benefits it would bring.\u201d But the project stalled in 2010 \u2013 due to high costs and internal politics, according to an engineer involved who did not want to be named \u2013 and shortly afterwards, everybody left. Only Ahmed remained; he has been guarding the derelict site for nearly two decades.\nThe site has since been handed over to Khulna City Corporation which did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs their children grew up and moved out, Ahmed and his wife, Amena Khatun, enjoyed spending their afternoons down by the river, watching the world go by. But six months ago, their quiet life was turned upside down.\nAfter her hands and feet became swollen, Khatun was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) \u2013 a serious, progressive disease that involves a gradual loss of kidney function. The couple were shocked to learn that Khatun\u2019s kidneys hadn\u2019t been working properly for nearly seven years and that her heart, lungs and central nervous system were already severely affected.\nAlthough the 65-year-old already had high blood pressure and showed symptoms of fatigue, achy muscles and shortness of breath, neither she nor her doctor had been concerned about her kidney health. But further tests revealed high levels of protein in Khatun\u2019s urine.\nThe consumption of saline water in coastal Bangladesh has long been associated with various health risks, including hypertension, respiratory problems and pre-eclampsia, but its effect on kidney health remains relatively unknown.\nChronic kidney disease is a major public health issue worldwide but studies suggest a higher prevalence (22%) among Bangladeshis than the global average (10%). \u201cMost people with CKD don\u2019t even know they have it,\u201d says Dr Abu Mohammed Naser, an environmental health professor at the University of Memphis. \u201cMany miss early diagnosis, as often they don\u2019t experience symptoms until the disease has already advanced considerably.\u201d\nAs Bangladesh\u2019s third-largest city, Khulna, on the banks of the Rupsha and Bhairab rivers, was once the economic heartland of the south-western region, known for its jute mills, shipyards and thriving fishing industry. But frequent floods, cyclones and tidal surges are having an adverse effect on the city\u2019s freshwater resources, with saline intrusion resulting in a shortage of clean and safe water. Meanwhile on land, a booming shrimp-cultivation industry \u2013 which has earned Khulna its reputation as Shrimp City \u2013 is contaminating remaining freshwater repositories.\nView image in fullscreen The Rupsha River. Frequent floods, cyclones and tidal surges are having an adverse effect on Khulna\u2019s freshwater resources\nFor people like Ahmed and Khatun, there is no choice but to continue using contaminated water. Around Khulna\u2019s Notun Bazar area, residents regularly use saline water for cooking, drinking and bathing. \u201cSalt water surrounds us,\u201d says Ahmed. \u201cIt\u2019s in our rivers, in our tubewells and in our drinking cups \u2013 there\u2019s no escaping it.\u201d\nIn 2017, Naser investigated the effects of water salinity on kidney health in coastal areas of south-western Bangladesh, including Khulna. Measuring urinary sodium and total protein in the urine samples of 1,185 trial participants from 532 households, as well as their salt intake from drinking water sources, Naser found that 37% had mild proteinuria (elevated levels of protein in their urine) while 20% had moderate or substantial proteinuria.\n\u201cThis shows that drinking-water sodium and urinary sodium are associated with increased protein excretion, which is a powerful marker for kidney disease,\u201d he says. More recently, Naser conducted a further study comparing the effects of extreme heat on kidney health between men and women in Bangladesh.

Khulna was particularly affected, with extreme heat resulting in a rise in hospital admissions, forcing patients to occupy corridors and stairways as wards ran out of beds.\n\u201cThese coastal communities are suffering the double burden of climate change,\u201d says Naser. \u201cOn one hand, high temperatures cause profound sweating, loss of body fluid, and dehydration \u2013 and on the other, there\u2019s no suitable water for them to drink and rehydrate. This water crisis has become a major health hazard with deadly consequences.\u201d\nSitting up in her bed, wrapped in a red shawl, Khatun flicks through her medical notes, trying to make sense of her situation. \u201cThe pain is so intolerable, I\u2019m not able to sleep or eat,\u201d she says. The food her daughter brought remains untouched on the bedside table among scattered papers and pills.\nView image in fullscreen The medication Khatun has to take for her CKD. She also has to go for dialysis up to three times a week\nSince her diagnosis, her health has deteriorated. She was told she needed to start dialysis immediately, and continue up to three times a week. To avoid the long waiting list at the local government hospital she went to a private clinic where each dialysis session costs 5,000 taka (\u00a334). The family have now used up all their savings and have had to take out a loan. To cover the additional costs of medication, Khatun has been skipping dialysis sessions.\nDialysis capacity across health facilities in Bangladesh remains inadequate to meet the current and projected needs of CKD patients, according to research.\nAs the evening draws to a close, Ahmed walks Khatun to the riverbank, where they watch the sun set over the river. Behind them looms the forlorn structure of an abandoned water plant that once showed promise but now tells a story of neglect.\nAlthough the Bangladesh government and local partners have introduced initiatives to improve access to safe drinking water in south-western Bangladesh, the situation in Khulna is expected to worsen.\n\u201cThere is seriously not enough vigorous research being done in this area. A deeper understanding of the links between heat, water salinity and kidney health can enable timely interventions and better health outcomes,\u201d says Naser. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see an improvement in water quality, we can expect an increase in kidney-related diseases in the future.\u201d",

        "content": "title: \u2018Nowhere to go\u2019: Rohingya face arson attacks in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State \n content: Rohingya, targeted by the Myanmar military in 2017, are caught in the middle as the Arakan Army and military battle in the western state.\nFighting between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army (AA) has escalated in the western state of Rakhine in recent days, putting thousands of mostly Muslim Rohingya who live in the area at increased risk.\nBased on interviews with Rohingya activists who have spoken to witnesses in Buthidaung, there have been huge fires across the town in the last few days. They accuse the Arakan Army of being behind the arson campaign, but the AA has rejected the allegations saying the fires were started by the Myanmar military in air attacks.\nWhat is clear is that thousands of Rohingya are fleeing for their lives and are increasingly unsafe, caught between the military, which seized power in a coup more than three years ago and in 2017 launched a brutal crackdown on the Rohingya that is now the subject of a genocide investigation, and the AA.\n\u201cAs of now, people are still on the road looking for a safe place,\u201d Nay San Lwin, the co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition advocacy group, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThere is no food or medicine at all. Most of them couldn\u2019t carry their personal belongings.\u201d\nThe Arakan Army is an ethnic armed group based in Rakhine state and is believed to have about 30,000 troops. The armed wing of the United League of Arakan, it represents the state\u2019s majority Buddhist Rakhine and wants autonomy for the people of Arakan, the old name for the state. It was in an increasingly tentative ceasefire with the military until November last year.\nNay San Lwin claims the AA issued an ultimatum late last week, demanding that the Rohingya vacate Buthiduang by 10am on May 18, 2024. The AA had already attacked key locations where the Rohingya had sought shelter, including a school and a hospital, resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities, he said. The entire town reportedly \u201cwitnessed AA troops set fire to their houses\u201d.\nRohingya sources report that since May 17, thousands of Rohingya refugees have sought safety in central Buthidaung, occupying any available space, including houses, government buildings, a hospital and schools. At least four different sources told Al Jazeera that fleeing Rohingya had been forced from their homes.\nAl Jazeera was unable to independently verify the competing claims because the state\u2019s internet and mobile phone networks have been largely shut off.\nThe Arakan Army denies being involved in the alleged arson campaign, but announced at the weekend that it had taken control of Buthidaung. On May 19, the AA\u2019s Commander-In-Chief Twan Mrat Naing posted what appeared to be a warning on his X account.\n\u201cAttention R-Bengali diaspora activists and coterie,\u201d he wrote, using the term \u201cBengali\u201d that the Rohingya consider a slur. \u201cThe ppl of MM are fighting against a brutal military regime with great tribulations and sacrifices. Please stop selfish grumpiness and sabotaging, dragging the struggle into the wrong direction. It is time to abandon your misbegotten scheme of creating a separate islamic safe zone through foreign interventions, it is very unpatriotic.\u201d\nOn Monday, the United League of Arakan blamed the Myanmar military for the fires. In a statement, it condemned the military for \u201cprolonged aerial attacks on Buthidaung\u201d, saying that \u201cin reality, the SAC and its allies have destructed the town\u201d, using the acronym for the State Administration Council as the military calls itself.\nTrapped in rice fields\nRegardless of who is responsible for the attacks, human rights groups are sounding the alarm: warning of the danger of another serious wave of ethnic and communal violence that could be even worse than in 2017.\nThat year, more than 750,000 Rohingya fled into neighbouring Bangladesh after the military launched a series of attacks on their villages after the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), an armed group, attacked several police posts.\nThe United Nations has found that the military committed crimes against humanity and genocide in the crackdown, which is now the subject of an International Court of Justice genocide case.\nWhile those who fled continue to live in sprawling refugee camps in Bangladesh, about 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, mostly in Rakhine state, and live under severe restrictions.\nAccording to Fortify Rights, a human rights organisation working closely with Rohingya in both Bangladesh and Rakhine, the situation is extremely tense in a state that has a long history of communal violence.\nFortify Rights says while it is extremely difficult to verify who is responsible for the attacks, the reports from the past two nights have been harrowing.\n\u201cThe AA and junta must refrain from causing harm or targeting civilian infrastructure including homes,\u201d Sai Arkar, a human rights associate at Fortify Rights told Al Jazeera. \u201cThe area that has been burned does not seem to be a military target. [There are] reports of thousands of Rohingya being trapped in rice fields in the middle of the night, including children.\u201d\nThe Special Advisory Council to Myanmar, known as the SAC-M, a group of former UN special rapporteurs monitoring the situation in Myanmar since the 2021 coup, also stressed the urgency of the situation.\n\u201cThere are credible reports that Rohingya in Buthidaung have been targeted in attacks by the AA. There is a very real risk that these attacks could escalate further,\u201d Yanghee Lee, the former UN special rapporteur on Myanmar and founder of SAC-M, told Al Jazeera.\nHer concerns are supported by a Crisis Group report on May 10 that warned of the resurgence of inter-communal tensions in Rakhine. The think tank warned the military regime, which recently activated a long-dormant conscription law, would seek to foment inter-communal strife by forcing Rohingya to fight alongside them. Thousands had probably been conscripted, mostly forcibly, with the military playing on fears of the AA\u2019s intentions but also dangling the promise of regular wages.\n\u201cThe military has no qualms about using them as cannon fodder against the Arakan Army,\u201d the report said.\nWhile Lee stressed the military was the \u201cmain perpetrator of violence against civilians in Rakhine state\u201d, she added that it was \u201cextremely alarming that the AA now seems to be turning their guns on the Rohingya to complete the genocide undertaken by the same military it has long-opposed\u201d. She urged the UN Human Rights Council to take immediate action to address the situation in Rakhine.\nSatellite evidence\nGiven the complexity of the conflict in Rakhine, it is difficult to prove who is responsible for the arson attacks, but satellite evidence appears to corroborate the testimony of local witnesses.\nNathan Russer, a geospatial analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), told Al Jazeera that based on satellite and other available evidence, the arson attacks were most likely to have been carried out by the AA.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a widespread scale of arson attacks focused on [the] Buthidaung township in northern Rakhine State,\u201d Russer said. \u201cIt appears that most of the villages and areas targeted in recent days are Rohingya settlements.\u201d\nRusser noted that an earlier wave of arson attacks in Buthidaung targeted largely ethnic Rakhine communities from April 11 to April 17.\nMuch of the arson in the last few days has targeted villages on the outskirts of Buthidaung, primarily to the south and southeast. He said that at least 35 villages in the area appear to have suffered significant fire damage.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing basically villages being burned down, an entire urban area being burned down, and surrounding fields and forests being largely untouched. This is quite diagnostic of an on-the-ground arson campaign, rather than a remote arson campaign.\n\u201cPutting those two facts together suggests very strongly that it\u2019s the Arakan Army which has been responsible, corroborated by pretty unanimous eye-witness accounts from Buthidaung town itself, and seemingly from the surrounding areas.\u201d\n\u2018Burned to the ground\u2019\nLocal Rohingya say the military\u2019s air attacks took place in the afternoon on May 19, while the arson attacks reportedly began later that evening. Nay San Lwin stressed that the military\u2019s troops had left the town at least three days before, on May 14, adding more credence to the allegations against the AA.\nWai Wai Nu, the director of the Women\u2019s Peace Support Network who has close connections in Rakhine, also told Al Jazeera that she suspected the AA was behind the attacks.\n\u201cMy community on the ground is telling me they feel like it is \u2018the end of the world\u2019 and that it is worse than in 2017,\u201d Wai Wai Nu said. \u201cI was also informed about cases of mass killings in different villages. They can be killed by the Arakan Army or the Myanmar junta any time.\u201d\nShe said the Rohingya have long been living under an \u201capartheid regime\u201d enforced by the Myanmar military, which has implemented discriminatory laws and policies, such as travel restrictions and other abuses. Now more than ever, she said, ethnic armed groups, and the broader pro-democracy movement, must work harder to protect vulnerable communities \u2013 especially the Rohingya.\nThey have \u201cnowhere to go,\u201d Wai Wai Nu said.\nOver the last 24 hours, Nay San Lwin has spent his time fielding phone calls from family and others he knows in Buthidaung, trying to gather more details on the attacks. But it is a struggle given the network blackout.\n\u201cI spoke to six people yesterday\u2026 But the mobile network is extremely poor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere were no [Myanmar] military personnel nor ARSA present in the town. The Arakan Army troops suddenly came into the town and forced the people to leave their homes before setting the fire. Almost the entire town has been burned to the ground. Only a few houses remain intact.\u201d",

Warrants are also being sought for three top Hamas officials: Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, political chief Ismail Haniyah, and Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, the leader of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, who is better known as Mohammed Deif.\nHere\u2019s what we know about the ICC cases and what they mean for Israel and Hamas.\nHow would an arrest warrant affect Netanyahu or Hamas leaders?\nThe decision to seek arrest warrants doesn\u2019t immediately mean the individual is guilty, but is the first stage in a process that could lead to a lengthy trial.\nIf the court finds sufficient evidence of crimes, it can summon the suspect to appear voluntarily. The court can also issue an arrest warrant, relying on member countries to make the arrest and transfer the suspect to the ICC.\nIf the suspect appears before the court, a pre-trial takes place in which the court decides if there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. Then there is a trial before three ICC judges, in which the prosecution must prove \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d that the individual is guilty of the crimes.\nOnce a verdict passes, the charged individual may be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison. Under exceptional circumstances, a life sentence can also be given, the court says.\nThe ICC has so far issued arrest warrants against 42 people, 21 of whom have been detained with the help of member states.\n\u201cThe immediate problem for Israeli officials under any ICC arrest warrant would be that the court\u2019s 124 member states would be under a legal obligation to arrest such officials if they traveled to any of those 124 countries,\u201d Chile Eboe-Osuji, a former ICC president, wrote this month in Foreign Policy magazine.\n\u201cThat obligation should not be underestimated,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cjust last year, Putin canceled his plans to attend the BRICS summit in South Africa, in the apparent light of Pretoria\u2019s obligation to arrest him.\u201d\nOf Hamas leaders for whom arrest warrants are sought, two \u2013 Sinwar and Deif \u2013 are believed to be in Gaza, while Haniyah resides in Qatar, which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute.\nWhat is the ICC and who can it indict?\nHeadquartered at The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC was established in 2002 and is tasked with prosecuting individuals for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\nUnlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the ICC is not an organ of the United Nations and does not prosecute states.\nWhile the ICC is independent of the UN, it is endorsed by the UN\u2019s General Assembly and maintains a cooperation agreement with the UN. When a case is not within the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction, the UN Security Council can refer that case to the ICC, granting it jurisdiction.\nThe court can investigate alleged crimes committed on the territory, or by a national, of any state that has accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction by signing the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC. Any member state can ask the ICC\u2019s prosecutor to launch an investigation.\nThe court has previously issued arrest warrants against high-ranking individuals, including former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, Saif Gadhafi, the son of the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and most recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nSignatory states are obliged to apprehend those facing arrest warrants, but leaders have often sought to evade those warrants, restricting their freedom of movement.\nThe ICC does not have its own enforcement mechanism and has relied on countries\u2019 support for arrests.\nVideo Ad Feedback ICC chief details charges he is seeking against Hamas and Israeli leaders 02:04 - Source: CNN\nDoes the ICC have jurisdiction over Israeli nationals?\nIsrael\u2019s actions in Gaza were referred to the ICC by five countries \u2013 South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti \u2013 in November, calling on the court to investigate the possible crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, among others, in the Palestinian territories, and asked it to determine whether \u201cone or more specific persons should be charged.\u201d\nIsrael does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC as it hasn\u2019t signed the Rome Statute. But that doesn\u2019t mean its citizens cannot be prosecuted by the court.\nThe court had already been investigating possible crimes committed by Israel since 2014 in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. The investigation began in March 2021, and was referred to the court by the Palestinian Authority, which adopted the ICC\u2019s mandate in 2015 as the State of Palestine. The ICC concluded then that it has jurisdiction on the conflict and, \u201cby majority, that the territorial scope of this jurisdiction extends to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\u201d\nThat investigation, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said, \u201cis ongoing and extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence since the attacks that took place on 7 October 2023.\u201d\nRemarks by Netanyahu this month pointed to anxiety about the ICC probe. Issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials would leave an \u201cindelible stain\u201d on the edifice of international law and justice, Netanyahu said, adding that the ICC was \u201cfounded as a consequence of the Holocaust\u201d and should not attempt to \u201cundermine\u201d Israel\u2019s fundamental right to self-defense.\nThe ICC action comes as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a different court in The Hague, considers a case brought by South Africa in which Israel is accused of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel recognizes the ICJ.\nIsrael\u2019s war in Gaza, prompted by the October 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 others hostage, has dragged on for nearly eight months.\nMore than 35,000 people have been killed during Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities. Swathes of the territory have been reduced to rubble and more than half of its population of 2.3 million has been internally displaced. Famine has set in in parts of the strip.\nDoes the ICC have jurisdiction over Hamas?\nPalestinian leaders signed up to the Rome Statute in 2015. As such, the ICC has jurisdiction over actors in Gaza and other Palestinian territories and by extension, over actors in those territories, including Hamas.\nICC prosecutor Khan confirmed this in October, saying alleged crimes committed by Israel in Gaza, or by Hamas in Israel, fall under the court\u2019s jurisdiction, Reuters reported.\nThis means the court can indict Hamas leaders over possible crimes committed against both Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\nShelly Aviv Yeini, head of the international law department at the Israeli Hostage and Missing Families Forum, said the ICC could make Hamas accountable for crimes even if the state of Israel does not recognize the authority of the court.\n\u201cWe are an NGO, a private entity,\u201d Yeini told CNN earlier, as the families of hostages held by Gaza gathered to submit a complaint against Hamas to the ICC. \u201cWe can bring about a claim in the name of the hostages even if the state (Israel) doesn\u2019t recognize its (the ICC\u2019s) jurisdiction.\u201d\nICC prosecutor Khan said Monday he is seeking the warrants \u201con the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office,\u201d and thanked families of the hostages \u201cfor their courage in coming forward to provide their accounts.\u201d\nAccording to Article 15 of the ICC Rome Statue, any individual, group, or organization can file complaints of potential crimes to the court.\nA member of the Hamas political bureau, Muhammad Nazzal, told CNN in February that going to the ICC was \u201ca mistake\u201d that would stall negotiations to return the hostages.\n\u201cThe shortest way to return their prisoners is to complete the ongoing negotiating process,\u201d the Hamas member told CNN at the time.\nHow have Hamas, Israel and others reacted to the ICC\u2019s action?\nBoth Hamas and Israeli politicians denounced the ICC\u2019s move.\nHamas said it was an attempt to \u201cequate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis.\u201d The militant group said warrant requests for Netanyahu and Gallant had come \u201cseven months late,\u201d referring to the duration of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\nIsraeli politicians across the political spectrum condemned the decision. Foreign Minister Israel Katz called it a \u201cscandalous decision\u201d and an \u201cunrestrained frontal attack on the victims of October 7 and our 128 hostages in Gaza.\u201d\nThe leader of the opposition, Yair Lapid, called it \u201ca complete moral failure\u201d and said Israel \u201ccannot accept the outrageous comparison between Netanyahu and Sinwar.\u201d\nThe right-wing minister for National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, accused the ICC of antisemitism and called for an escalation of attacks against Hamas, while Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said: \u201cWe have not seen such a show of hypocrisy and hatred of Jews as that of the Hague Tribunal since Nazi propaganda.\u201d\nCNN has reached out to the Prime Minister\u2019s office and Defense Ministry.\nIn the US, meanwhile, President Joe Biden has denounced the ICC prosecutor\u2019s move, calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\u201cLet me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2014 none \u2014 between Israel and Hamas,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWe will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.\u201d\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said the US \u201cfundamentally rejects\u201d the ICC prosecutor\u2019s announcement and warned it could \u201cjeopardize\u201d efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release agreement.\n\u201cWe reject the prosecutor\u2019s equivalence of Israel with Hamas. It is shameful. Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization that carried out the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and is still holding dozens of innocent people hostage, including Americans,\u201d Blinken said in a statement.\nHe questioned \u201cthe legitimacy and credibility of this investigation,\u201d and said the US believed the ICC to have \u201cno jurisdiction over this matter.\u201d\nThe US is not a signatory to the Rome Statute.\nCNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond, Benjamin Brown, Melanie Zanona, Aber Salman and Michael Schwartz contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Beyond renewables: A coordinated and just transition for Bangladesh",
        "content": "title: Beyond renewables: A coordinated and just transition for Bangladesh \n content: Bangladesh is lagging behind its renewable energy targets, with the current capacity standing at just four percent relative to the target of 10 percent by 2020, making it unlikely to reach the target of 100 percent by 2050. Yet, the success of the latest Conference of the Parties (COP28) agreement to substantially increase renewables in the next decade relies heavily on Asia, where many countries like Bangladesh are struggling to keep up.\nConversations and debates are plentiful around energy sources: renewables versus fossil fuel, and the challenges with renewables like high land requirements for solar expansion. However, what it takes for developing countries like Bangladesh to achieve a green transition gets limited attention.\nSo what are the crucial aspects of successful renewable energy transition that must be considered for a country like Bangladesh?\nTransmission and distribution\nThe Bangladesh government has built many power plants in recent years, but without corresponding investments to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the transmission and distribution systems. Without simultaneous, stepwise improvements in transmission, we risk a capacity logjam by only increasing production capacity, be it in renewables or fossil fuel. Regular planned power outages (load-shedding) while the existing power plants operate below capacity indicate an inadequate transmission system. However, another important cause of below-capacity production is the rising costs of importing coal, gas, and oil amid the growing foreign exchange reserve crisis. This further emphasises the need for diversifying domestic energy sources into renewables, especially because the country's existing gas reserve is dwindling and new exploration is not yet on the horizon.\nHowever, to accommodate the intermittency of renewables\u2014such as the seasonality of hydropower and surge during noon for solar power\u2014the transmission and distribution system must be updated. Moreover, our ambitious 2050 goal is only possible with trade within the region, which also requires expanding the transmission system. Nepal and Bhutan have surplus energy from hydropower during the monsoon season, and India has swathes of arid land with low cloud cover, raising the potential of renewable energy trade with Bangladesh, where the topology, population, and agricultural density limit the renewable production possibility. Indeed, the recent tripartite power-sharing agreement between Bangladesh, Nepal, and India is a step in that direction. But ramping up regional trade may require dedicated transmission lines and grid integration. These technical challenges can be answered with tried and tested solutions elsewhere. However, these require investment and coordinated development across the board, in line with capacity increases and demand mapping for the medium and long run as our industrial energy requirements are expected to continue changing.\nSuch investments in the transmission and distribution system have the added benefit of increasing efficiency and thereby minimising system loss and the associated carbon emissions from power use. The upgrading of grid systems needs to support rooftop solar and net metering options for both households and industrial rooftops, including in economic zones. Lowering high duties on inverters and greater availability of bi-directional metres could incentivise the adoption of rooftop solar by allowing sell-back to the grid. But most importantly, the grid needs to be upgraded to support such an initiative.\nSources and costs of financing\nInfrastructure projects in developing and emerging economies often cannot attract sufficient financing. Challenges of scaling up investments include the high cost of funds in developing countries like Bangladesh, partly due to the lack of a deep domestic financing market. The constraint may be partially addressed by using a combination of sources at different stages of the project\u2014public financing from governments and banks acting as debt investors in the early stage, and bond financing at a later stage.\nAs we become a developing country, it would be beneficial to continue to have concessional rates for sectors like renewables and transmission. Multilateral development institutions are well-placed to provide long-term financing for projects that have public benefits. With the proliferation of Southern-led development banks like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), New Development Bank (NDB), and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), in addition to the traditional Bretton Woods Institutions (BWIs) like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB), different types of support for large infrastructure projects at different stages are possible.\nOlder multilaterals and the newer Southern-led multilateral development banks are increasingly financing different kinds of projects. BWIs are financing preparatory work, feasibility studies, and capacity-building compared to earlier greenfield power projects. Instead, large-scale power projects are now funded through bilateral financing and the newer Southern-led policy banks. This difference between older and newer multilaterals in their respective specialisations could help address challenges around inadequate preparation and due diligence of projects that countries like Bangladesh face when seeking financing, which contributes to the higher cost of financing. The prioritisation of older BWIs on capacity-building could help Bangladesh do the necessary leg work required to seek financing for bankable projects from Southern development banks and other bilateral sources.\nSolar expansion through agrivoltaics will involve more jobs for women and low-skill workers in Bangladesh than any other power source, fossil fuel or renewable. PHOTO: BSS\nIn addition to sources of financing, the costs of financing must be made more salient and central to our policy conversations. The financing terms, including interest rates and repayment timelines, are often not made obvious to the taxpayers. Increasing production capacity without simultaneously improving transmission and distribution systems will mean unused power plants that are not operating, while loan repayments for their construction keep racking up. Finally, infrastructure financing in Bangladesh relies on policy support such as subsidies or feed-in tariffs for economic viability. This becomes unmanageable in the presence of fossil fuel subsidies. A gradual phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies is necessary to free up resources for investments in renewables and grid modernisation.\nJob impacts\nHistorically low-emitting and developing countries like Bangladesh need to consider not only emissions, but also the jobs impact of green transition. Furthermore, we need to consider not only the total number of jobs produced by renewable expansion, but also who gets the jobs. An ongoing study by BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD) estimates the direct and upstream impact of renewable transition in Bangladesh.\nSolar energy is the most feasible option for Bangladesh, but it is land-intensive and requires importing almost all the necessary inputs. In the medium run, this means solar expansion in the country will not see gains from upstream employment as solar panel-producing countries do.\nGas and coal plants require more construction and land preparation compared to solar, providing jobs for low and middle-skill workers. Our research shows solar expansion just on its own leads to a loss of jobs for low and middle-skill workers in Bangladesh. However, if solar energy is combined with agriculture\u2014called agrivoltaics or agrisolar energy\u2014the land intensity will be reduced. Moreover, solar expansion through agrivoltaics will involve more jobs for women and low-skill workers in Bangladesh than any other power source, fossil fuel or renewable.\nBangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with immense pressure on agricultural land. Agriculture remains the largest employment sector in the country, employing over 40 percent of the country's workforce. Although the agricultural share in the economy has been declining over the years, over 46 percent of all households in Bangladesh have derived some income from agriculture. Gains in agriculture accounted for 90 percent of the reduction in poverty between 2005 and 2010. A land policy draft by the government in 2016 discourages using agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes like industrial or infrastructural development. Hence, land shortages in the nation continue to hold back renewable energy development.\nHarvesting crops and solar energy using agrivoltaics on one-crop land could be a promising solution for Bangladesh's land scarcity and agriculture production in the short and medium terms. In the longer term, Bangladesh could benefit by developing its abilities to first assemble and then produce solar panels and their components.\nAgrivoltaics can increase the economic value of the land by more than 30 percent and increase the overall land productivity by 60-70 percent. Crops that grow under partial shade, like tomato, cotton, potato, tea, coffee, garlic, onion and turmeric, are best suited for agrivoltaic systems. For instance, with only four hours of gentle sunlight each day and minimal irrigation, garlic and onions can be grown. The added shade can further reduce irrigation requirements by minimising evapotranspiration rates. Moreover, the production of vegetable crops under the panel can reduce soil erosion and the amount of dust on the solar panel.\nAllocating agricultural lands to produce energy only could have an immense impact on the livelihood of agriculture-based households. Hence, simultaneous use of land for farming the right type of crops and generating solar energy can be a win-win solution, keeping in mind the marketability of the crop. The next steps involve a proof-of-concept pilot where variations in crop types and solar panel angles are considered. Eventually, changes to the 2016 land policy draft discouraging agricultural land use would be required in addition to coordination between the power and agriculture ministries. Incorporating agrivoltaic systems into broader national energy strategies and land-use planning efforts is vital to maximise its potential benefits and minimise potential conflicts with agricultural practices.\nDr Rohini Kamal is assistant professor and research fellow at BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), BRAC University.\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "content": "title: The inhumane conditions in Cox\u2019s Bazar and what must be done to support refugees looking for a dignified, hopeful future \n content: 24 May 2024\nThe Rohingya people have been persecuted for decades by the Myanmar military as an ethnic minority, with a renewed wave of violence in 2017 causing nearly one million people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. The United States in 2022 declared the Myanmar military had perpetrated a genocide against the Rohingya during the 2017 atrocities. They aren\u2019t recognised by their own government and are stuck in limbo.\nThe homes they left behind have been destroyed, and the Bangladesh government is signalling that they want them to return to Myanmar. The vast majority of Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya have no legal status, having been effectively deprived of a nationality as a result of discriminatory laws, policies and practices.\nThe vast majority of Rohingya refugees have fled across the border into Bangladesh, settling into the Cox\u2019s Bazar district. Cox\u2019s Bazar shares a border with Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State where the Rohingya primarily reside. Refugees are settled across multiple refugee camps within Cox\u2019s Bazar, with no investment in their living conditions or education.\nThe conditions in the camp\nIn October 2023, Amnesty staff travelled to Bangladesh alongside M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and UNHCR to the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar. The Rohingya shared with them accounts of Myanmar security forces carrying out mass killings, torture, rape and burning of entire villages. The conditions in the camp are inhumane. With refugees not allowed to leave the fences that surround them, they\u2019re trapped inside with limited food, water and electricity.\nThere are close to one million people living in Cox\u2019s Bazar, with around 800,000 of those having been there for at least 6 years. With over 200,000 families spread across 34 camps in just 24km2, it\u2019s one of the most densely populated parts of the world. There are an average of 4-5 people per household, with families living in makeshift bamboo and tarp shelters that were designed to be a temporary housing solution.\nThe huts have become semi-permanent homes, providing little protection against heat, cold and frequent extreme weather events. Without plumbing, families are forced to collect water by hand, often travelling long distances to reach a water pump. Toilets are communal and provide no privacy, putting women and children at risk, particularly at night as there\u2019s almost no lighting and a constant danger of being attacked.\nDisplays showing what rations can be purchased monthly, however receiving only US$8 per month, many can only afford the bare minimum. \u00a9 Pablo Barnes\nAs they\u2019re not allowed to work, refugees are wholly dependent on foreign aid for food supplies. They\u2019re provided with a ration of just US$8 a month per person, which allows them to purchase only oil, rice, salt and chillies. These meagre rations have also been decreasing due to a lack of funding, forcing refugees to live off 27 cents per day. Not only does this severely impact their mental health, but also physical health, as the food they purchase isn\u2019t up to the minimum standard of nutrition for a person.\nA lot of the inhabitants are born in the camps, having lived their entire lives inside the confines of the fences that surround them. With no opportunity for secondary education or work, refugees feel like they\u2019ve been discarded by the international community and are simply wasting away.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t allow it for yourself\u2026 and yet these people are supposed to accept it.\u201d Craig Foster\nAs a result, the community, particularly young people, are turning to crime, in part due to being unable to afford necessities, but also due to not having any playgrounds or sporting fields to spend time in. The camp system has led to a dramatic increase in domestic violence and conflict more generally in society. People have to stay awake at night and act as security guards to protect the little possessions they have.\nThere\u2019s an active incentive for people to have children, as it increases the allowance they receive per month, but that in turn has increased pressure in the camps. With already limited supplies, there\u2019s no guarantee of prosperity for these children.\nAn immense strain on the already short-staffed medical system is causing a plethora of health issues in the population. Underlying malnutrition is a major cause of a lot of the health problems in the camp, especially for pregnant women who are coming in with nutritional deficiencies which leads to the birth of children with a plethora of deficiencies. To compound this problem there are a multitude of outbreaks in the camp, including diphtheria, cholera, measles, COVID-19, scabies and dengue.\nChildren will only \u201cattain a fifth of their potential: cognitively, behaviourally, emotionally, developmentally and physically. It\u2019s so urgent, but you\u2019re not going to see the effects for a generation.\u201d Jenifer Leaf Jaeger \u2013 MSF\nLived experience: Life for the Rohingya in Cox\u2019s Bazar\nThe Rohingya refugees in Cox\u2019s Bazar have faced hardship after hardship, from persecution in their homeland, to resettlement, to fires in refugee camps. They\u2019ve met every challenge with resilience and courage and it\u2019s vital to share and uplift their stories.\nZia\nZia standing from a lookout over the refugee camp \u00a9 Pablo Barnes\nZia is a photographer, writer, activist and the found of the Rohingyatographer Magazine. After fleeing Myanmar in 2017 due to discrimination against the Rohingya, Zia settled in a Bangladeshi refugee camp, where he initially worked for the Danish Refugee Council and now freelances for NGOs and media.\n\u201cThis is photography and this is truth telling.\u201d Sahat Zia Hero\nThrough his photography, Zia aims to showcase the conditions his people face in the camps, while raising awareness and garnering support for their rights.\n\u201cBecause of the humanitarian crisis we are facing, our youth are being engaged to the negative activities like human trafficking, smuggling and trafficking and kidnapping. This can only be solved as we overcome the humanitarian crisis.\u201d\nThe latest issue of Rohingyatographer is centred around food, an integral part of Rohingya culture. Zia highlights that cultural practices and traditions have been difficult to carry on with the conditions in the camp, and that the food culture is already disappearing due to the very limited resources they have.\n\u201cWe are losing our younger generation.\u201d Sahat Zia Hero\nZia calls on the Australian people to raise awareness and support the Rohingya people, especially to increase the intake of refugees. For Zia, resettlement would provide hope for younger people in the camps, who have been robbed of a fair go and chance to experience life.\nHasina\nHasina at the MSF Hospital, Kutupalong. \u00a9 Pablo Barnes\n\u201cPlease, pray for our survival in this cyclone of ceaseless suffering. Hasina\nYoung mother Hasina endured a harrowing ordeal when an LPG gas canister exploded in her tiny hut, setting it on fire. Both she and her husband, who rushed in to save her, were severely burned. They were rushed to the nearest medical facility, but the hospital was overstretched and there were very limited resources. Due to not having a caretaker, Hasina and her husband weren\u2019t able to undergo vital surgery. While Hasina survived, her husband tragically died. Despite her grief and agonising injuries, she proves her resilience daily as she cares for her family.\nMohamed\nMohamed at the MSF Hospital, Kutupalong. \u00a9 Pablo Barnes\n23 year old Mohamed struggles with skin diseases like dengue and eczema, which are spreading like wildfire across the camps. He says that diseases have been spreading rapidly due to waste around the camps, including dengue, eczema, scabies, and other skin diseases.\nA future for the Rohingya: what needs to happen\nThe preferred outcome for the Rohingya is to be able to return to their homes in Myanmar. However, the current regime is being led by the architects of the 2017 ethnic cleansing campaign \u2013 the Myanmar Military, who are still denying the Rohingya people their rights and safety.\nA lack of accountability for atrocities and sustained military dominance mean that refugees who return would be at extreme risk, due to detention-like conditions and a lack of citizenship.\nIn their quest for safety, the Rohingya have and continue to embark on dangerous journeys in search for safety and a better life. A lot of refugees embark on precarious boat trips, aiming to find safety in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The refugees on these trips are exposed to risks of drowning, piracy and abuse by smugglers, who overcrowd them on unsafe vessels.\nRohingya refugees crowd into a vehicle for relocation to a nearby government building after demonstrating university students forced them out of the current government facility, in Banda Aceh on December 27, 2023. Hundreds of university students in Indonesia\u2019s westernmost province stormed a temporary shelter for more than a hundred Rohingya refugees on December 27, forcing them to leave in the latest rejection of the persecuted Myanmar minority. (Photo by CHAIDEER MAHYUDDIN / AFP)\nCountries often respond to these refugees with hostility, either pushing the boats back or detaining them in camps where conditions are as bad or even worse than the hardships they fled.

We must also advocate for international support. Australia can facilitate long term solutions to ensure education and employment opportunities for the Rohingya people, so they can not just survive, but thrive.\nOur recommendations to the Australian government:\nAdvocate with the Government of Bangladesh to: take greater steps to ensure the safety and dignity of people in refugee camps; expand access to education and employment opportunities; and ensure that Rohingya refugees aren\u2019t transferred to anywhere they would be at real risk of serious human rights abuses.\nAdvocate globally for increased funding for humanitarian needs in the camps and an increase in humanitarian resettlement places for Rohingya people.\nCommit to increasing Australia\u2019s Humanitarian Program to 40,000 places per year (30,000 under the government program and 10,000 under community sponsorship).\nEstablish a targeted quota for Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, while taking a lead role in resettling Rohingya refugees out of Bangladesh.\nDespite promises to increase the number of places in the Refugee and Humanitarian Program to 27,000, the Albanese government has failed to follow through in this year\u2019s federal budget, with the program remaining with a ceiling of 20,000 places.\nWhat you can do\nWe must pressure the government to live up to its promise of increasing the Refugee and Humanitarian Program to 27,000 places annually, as well as making an additional 5,000 places available through the Community Sponsorship Program.",

The limited access to electricity and power generation supplies such as fuel and solar systems hinders the proper functioning of both health facilities and partner operations. \u2013 health facilities and partner operations require 1.4-1.8 million litres of fuel The current medical evacuation mechanism is plagued by numerous challenges, including a limited number of patients evacuated per day, restrictive criteria, long waiting periods for patients, and competing priorities between patients with war injuries and those with chronic diseases. \u2013 since 6 May medevacs to outside Gaza ceased due to closure of the crossing Brain drain - The staff and the general population are traumatized forcing those who can raise the exorbitant fees to leave the Gaza Strip, starting a brain drain on the health system and other sectors. The formal market system has collapsed, and the informal market now dominates economic activities. Although cash is still available, movement and access to it are increasingly challenging, posing significant issues for partner operations. Poor telecommunications weakening referral mechanisms (community to facility and between facilities) Lack of access to water supply and other WASH needs including proper waste management capacity\n\nConditions required to support partners response activities\n\nImmediate and sustained ceasefire. Sustained humanitarian access to adequate quantities of supplies (including urgently needed fuel supplies and hospital equipment) and people (humanitarian workers, health workers, and patients).

        "content": "title: The world has become more resilient to disasters \n content: Deaths from disasters have fallen, but we need to build even more resilience to ensure this progress doesn't reverse.\nIn 1970, more than 300,000 people died when a strong cyclone hit the coast of Bangladesh.1 In 1985, another storm caused 15,000 deaths. Just six years later, another killed 140,000.\nFast-forward to 2020. Bangladesh was hit by cyclone Amphan, one of the strongest storms on record in the Bay of Bengal. The death toll was 26 - barely visible on the chart below, compared to these very deadly disasters.\nThat's 26 too many deaths, and the cyclone also caused huge amounts of damage: millions of people were displaced, and there were large economic losses. But tens - possibly hundreds - of thousands of lives were saved through early warnings, evacuations, and increased resilience. People in Bangladesh are much better protected from disasters than they were a few decades ago.\nThis development is part of a longer-term and widespread success in reducing humanity's vulnerability to storms, floods, earthquakes, and other hazards.\nNumber of deaths from storms\nStorms include tornado, hail, thunderstorm, sand storm, blizzards and extreme wind events\nThe world has become more resilient to disasters\nBangladesh is not an isolated example. We can observe long-term improvements in the world's resilience.\nHere, I will look at data published by the International Disaster Database, EM-DAT, which stretches back to 1900. In the chart below, I've shown the number of deaths from disasters, given as the decadal average. This is helpful as there is a lot of volatility in disasters from year to year.2 You can also explore this data annually.\nThe number of people killed in disasters has fallen a lot over the last century. That's despite there being four times as many people. That means the decline in death rates has been even more dramatic.\nDecadal average: Annual number of deaths from disasters\nDisasters include all geophysical, meteorological and climate events including earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides,drought, wildfires, storms, and flooding. Decadal figures are measured as the annual average over the subsequent ten-yearperiod.\nSingle events that caused over a million deaths were not rare in the first half of the 20th century. These events were mostly floods or droughts and were often linked to agricultural shocks that caused hunger and starvation. There are many similar examples in humanity's history before the year 1900. A strong El-Ni\u00f1o weather event in the 1870s led to severe famines across China, India, and Brazil, killing tens of millions.\nTo be clear, deaths haven't declined so steeply because disasters are becoming less frequent or intense. This data also doesn't mean climate change isn't happening or isn't worsening weather events. The main reason that fewer people are dying is that we've gotten better at protecting ourselves and each other.\nAs we'll see later, the toll of disasters depends on our physical environment, economic resources, political systems, technological advances, and cooperation.\nMassive productivity improvements have made agricultural systems far more resilient to shocks. Changes in political systems have reduced the risk of famine. As my colleagues Joe Hasell and Max Roser have shown, famines are rare in well-functioning democracies.\nWeather forecasts have improved dramatically over the past 50 years, and populations can better prepare for storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires. Many more countries have early warning systems.\nAnd overall, people worldwide are richer than they were a century ago. It's often the poorest who are most vulnerable to disasters. Having an earthquake-proof home, access to electricity and clean water, air conditioning or heating, enough money to absorb shocks in energy or food prices, and resources to recover after a disaster means you can protect yourself. Billions of people have gained access to these basic resources over the last century.\nMany researchers and organizations have noted this reduction in vulnerability to various types of disasters. The World Meteorological Organization found that deaths from climate and weather-related disasters decreased almost 3-fold from 1970 to 2019. Researchers Giuseppe Formetta and Luc Feyen studied a different disaster database - Munich RE's NatCatSERVICE - and found a large reduction in global vulnerability to disasters from the 1980s to 2010s.3\n\"No such thing as a natural disaster\"\nThree factors determine the risk of damage when a hazard hits.\nFirst, the characteristics of the hazard itself. Is it a flood, drought, hurricane, or heatwave? What's its magnitude, speed, or power? And how long does it last? Is it a 30-minute downpour or a 5-day deluge of heavy rainfall?\nSecond, the number of people or the amount of infrastructure exposed to the hazard. Does the earthquake strike a densely populated city or a rural area? How many people live on a coastline inundated by storm surges or sea level rise? How much stuff - buildings, bridges, roads, and other infrastructure - is in harm's way?\nThird and finally, the vulnerability of those who are exposed. A heatwave in Dubai will be less harmful than one in New Delhi because most people in Dubai have air conditioning. A strong earthquake in a country with quake-resistant infrastructure will be less damaging than the one that struck Haiti in 2010. Vulnerability is often strongly linked to income: poorer countries and communities tend to have fewer resources to protect themselves and respond afterward.\nDisaster risk, then, sits at the center of all three. An increase in any of these dimensions increases the risk, while a reduction lowers it.\nThis is why you might hear the phrase, \"There's no such thing as a natural disaster\". Hazards only become disasters when they impact societies and people. A hurricane, for example, is not a disaster until it hurts or kills people or destroys homes in its path.\nHow does this framework explain the dramatic decline in deaths from disasters over the last century?\nThe hazard component has not declined. It has probably increased - on several dimensions - because of climate change.4\nExposure has not declined either. There are more than four times as many people on the planet than a century ago. People have migrated to cities, often along coastlines, where events such as storm surges, cyclones, and flooding are more likely. That means more people in harm's way. What has reduced, though, is acute exposure to some events. Better weather prediction and early warning systems mean people can evacuate before a hazard hits.\nWhat has declined is vulnerability: a long list of improvements have made communities less vulnerable. Our agricultural systems are more productive and recover from damaging events. Political systems allow for national and international support before or after a hazard strikes. People live in better buildings. Some have heating or air conditioning to protect them from extreme temperatures.\nHow to reduce disaster risk going forward\nHow should we think about these three factors going forward?\nFirst, we will never be able to stop hazards completely. There will never be an end to earthquakes, cyclones, or extreme rainfall. What we can determine is how much worse they get in a changing climate. Hazards at 3\u00b0C of warming will be worse than at 2\u00b0C, which will be worse than at 1.5\u00b0C. We need to reduce our carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The better we do here, the less exposed and vulnerable we will be.\nBut that alone won't be enough. Regardless of how successful we are in reducing our emissions, climate change is already here, and the world will get warmer even on our most ambitious pathways. Societies will need to be more resilient to these changes, and they should be protected from events unrelated to climate change - the types of events that our ancestors were exposed to 50, 100, or 1,000 years ago.\nTo reduce exposure, we must understand when and where hazards are most likely to hit. We must understand which regions are most vulnerable to sea-level rise or wildfires. People are still moving into areas at serious risk in the future, exposing many of them to disruption and damage.\nIncreasing the coverage of early warning systems will help. When a hazard is imminent, people can evacuate and their exposure can be temporarily reduced. According to the World Meteorological Organization, around one-third of the world - mostly in the poorest countries - does not have these systems. I've recently written about this.\nFinally, there is a lot of room for reducing vulnerabilities. Poverty makes people most vulnerable; that's why I argue that lifting people out of poverty is an essential solution to reducing climate risks. Investing in infrastructure, making agriculture more productive, and building strong political governance are all vital. Poorer countries tend to have higher death rates from disasters, as the chart below shows. (Note that this is on a logarithmic scale.)\nDeath rates from disasters vs. GDP per capita, 2021\nDeath rates are measured per 100,000 people. Disasters include all geophysical, meteorological and climate eventsincluding earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides, drought, wildfires, storms, and flooding. GDP figures are adjusted forcross-country price differences.\nThis relationship is even stronger for the total number of people affected by disasters, which includes those left homeless, injured, or requiring assistance. People in lower-income countries are much more vulnerable to disasters such as drought, which affects many more people. Poorer infrastructure also means they're slower to respond and recover from disasters, leaving more people affected.\nRicher countries can help and have committed to doing so with adaptation funds within the Paris Agreement on climate change.\nOne way to build more resilient communities is to learn from other countries, like Bangladesh, that have saved many lives with the right preparation and response. The problem is that we tend to see the large and fatal events where things have gone wrong and miss the small events where people were protected. Disasters hit the news; averted ones don't.\nThankfully, some researchers are trying to change this. The project \"Disasters Avoided\", led by a team of disaster risk experts, tries to highlight case studies of events where disasters were prevented. As Ilan Kelman, one of the authors, writes: \"We frequently see headlines about disasters. But where are the headlines covering the good news of lives saved and damage averted when disasters do not happen?\"\nTo keep up with escalating climate change, we will need to move faster\nOver the last century, we have outpaced the impacts of climate change on natural disasters. Deaths have fallen despite climate change because we've built more resilient societies.\nThink of it like being in a race. Climate change has been jogging while we've been running. We've mostly stayed ahead, but there is no guarantee that things will stay that way. Slow down, and we'll be overtaken. Stay at the same pace, and we'll probably still be overtaken as the impacts of climate change accelerate.\nIf we fail to invest in protection measures and development trends slow down, then the progress we've made over the last century could easily reverse, and disaster deaths could start to rise again.\nWhat's key, though, is that the direction of that trend - a continued fall or a reversal - is up to us.\nNone of this will happen on its own. Bangladesh's success was driven by local communities and investment in early warning systems. Chile and Japan's resilience to earthquakes came from architects, engineers, and governments upholding strict building standards. The dramatic decline in famine came from technological revolutions in agriculture and populations pushing for political rights and accountability.\nInternational cooperation and support will be needed to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable are not left behind.\nEndnotes",

        "content": "title: Impact of Cuts Outcome of 2023 pilot study: Impact of funding shortfalls on beneficiaries \n content: Impact of Cuts Outcome of 2023 pilot study: Impact of funding shortfalls on beneficiaries\n\nCONTEXT\n\nIn 2023, WFP saw its largest funding gap in history, compelling the organization to make \u201chard calls\u201d regarding prioritization. While needs increased by 7% in 2023, major donors reduced their contribution by 41% leading to a funding shortfall of 64%. Projected operational requirements for 2024 amount to US$ 18.2 billion, while the forecasted contributions are at US$ 8 billion (see Figure 1).\n\nThis gap imposes a sizable strain on WFP Country Offices (COs) who have to implement prioritization in varying ways:\n\nReduce the ration size of assistance\n\nReduce the frequency of assistance\n\nReduce the number of beneficiaries\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND PILOT STUDIES\n\nMany WFP country operations were severely affected by funding shortages, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Malawi and Syria, which participated in a pilot study to assess the impact of assistance cuts on key food security indicators of beneficiary households.\n\nThe study makes use of three strategies to link the estimated results to WFP cuts and capture the full beneficiary experience:\n\nCarry out data collection on the same beneficiaries before and after the reduction in assistance to compare the impact (panel data)\n\nWhere prioritization context does not affect all beneficiaries, compare those affected by the cuts to beneficiaries not impacted (control group). This way, external factors affecting food security outcomes but not attributable to the cuts can be controlled for (economic shocks, seasonal changes, etc.)\n\nCollect qualitative data to capture the context and additional sensitivities experienced as a result from the cuts not captured in quantitative surveys.\n\nThis mixed method analysis design has been adapted to the prioritization context and realities around the implementation. Annex 1 summarizes the study design used in each pilot country. For more information around the study results, please refer to the country reports also found in Annex 1.\n---\nIMPACT OF CUTS | RESULTS\n\nFOOD SECURITY \u2013 FOOD CONSUMPTION This study reveals the extent to which impacts vary by country, even those experiencing similar prioritization contexts. WFP cuts impacted consumption significantly more for de-prioritized beneficiaries in Syria while all beneficiaries experienced a similar reduction in food consumption in Afghanistan. In refugee contexts, cuts in Malawi and Bangladesh had very diverse impact depending on the beneficiaries\u2019 livelihood opportunities or ability to afford alternative diets1.\n\nReducing the frequency of assistance for beneficiaries in Syria was directly linked to a 2 points reduction in Food Consumption Score (FCS) attributable to WFP cuts.\n\nSimilarly, in Afghanistan, both prioritized and excluded beneficiaries experienced reductions of 2 and 3 points in their FCS, respectively.\n\nBeneficiaries in Malawi did not see a significant impact on their FCS from the cuts, as coping strategies were applied to maintain the consumption, follow-up data collection aligned with mango season and fish remained affordable.\n\nHowever, in Bangladesh, where refugees are almost completely assistance dependent, data of the same households over time shows that the FCS significantly decreased in 2023 (up to 5 points).\n\nFOOD SECURITY \u2013 CONSUMPTION COPING STRATEGIES\n\nHouseholds have adopted a range of unsustainable and risky coping strategies in the first months after the cuts. This includes further rationing their already low food consumption either by reducing meal diversity, frequency, quality or size. In Bangladesh, this particularly affected the most vulnerable households (i.e., households headed by women, children, or elderly and those with disabled family members). As a result, several beneficiaries interviewed said that inadequate food consumption and nutrition impacted their physical health, making them feel weak and unable to engage in daily work activities.\n\nFOOD SECURITY \u2013 LIVELIHOOD COPING STRATEGIES\n\nAs another coping strategy, evidence points to beneficiaries using unsustainable alternative funding sources to access food, increasingly relying on the borrowing of money or credit. For example, in Afghanistan, excluded households experienced a 300% rise in credit-based purchases of key food groups. Additionally, The number of refugee households in Malawi who reported selling their non-food assistance to meet their food needs increased by 67% after the cuts (50% as compared to 30% before the cuts).\n\nBangladesh: Female Participant in FGD\n\nMy son was beaten by a neighbor because he borrowed money from him but couldn\u2019t return it on time.\n\nFOOD SECURITY \u2013 COPING STRATEGIES AFFECTING WOMEN AND CHILDREN\n\nIn all case studies, children and women are particularly affected by some unsustainable coping behaviors linked to the cuts. Beneficiaries decreased their spending on health and education to meet food needs after the cuts: as a result, children are withdrawn from schools and forced to work in often harsh conditions. In Syria, beneficiaries have also noted a rise in early marriages after the cuts.\n\nSyria: Female Participant in FGD My child has come to understand the situation and says that he is not hungry and does not want to eat in order to save food for the rest of the family.\n\nTo ensure additional income sources for their families, women start working in demanding conditions, often accepting low wages. Coping strategies used by women and children transform household dynamics, as families struggle to secure food, which can spark conflicts and present distinct parenting hurdles2. Begging increased after the cuts: in Afghanistan, this was especially severe in women-headed homes3. Meanwhile in Malawi, women increasingly engaged in transactional sex to earn money to buy food.\n\nMalawi: Female Participant in FGD Once WFP cash is over, I will sell my body for 2,000 KW to get food. There is no one here who can help you so you have to exchange your body [\u2026] currently I am in a situation where anyone who wants it, I will accept.\n\nPlease refer to the country report for additional limitations on the study performed in the four countries, see Annex 1 2 Insight from focus group discussions in Syria, but all countries are experiencing similar coping strategies which can impact household dynamics Women-headed homes in Afghanistan also increasingly ask for charity and borrow money/food from neighbors.\n---\nSOCIAL RELATIONS\n\nSocial relations among community members are also affected by the assistance cuts. For instance, focus group discussions showed increased occurrences of theft and criminal behavior4. However, in Afghanistan, an increase in sharing of assistance was noted as beneficiaries cope as a community.\n\nIn Malawi, beneficiaries reported a significant increase in theft and engagement in illegal and socially degrading activities.\n\nIn Bangladesh, reduced assistance worsened the relationship between Rohingya and the host community in Cox\u2019s Bazar.\n\nIn Afghanistan, households instead shared the burden of reduced resources as a community: 22% of the prioritized beneficiaries reported willingly sharing their assistance which supports the almost identical food consumption seen for prioritized and excluded households after the cuts.\n\nINTENTIONS TO MIGRATE Finally, beneficiaries who have depleted their coping capacities also consider moving away from their community in the search for better opportunities elsewhere. In Syria and Bangladesh, it was reported that young people, including children, move with the goal to financially support their families. Moreover, actual and intended migration through risky and illegal processes has also increased in Afghanistan.\n\nAfghanistan: Male Participant in FGD Every family is forcing their children to work or travel to Iran; I know many families who do this, and when we look around the city, we see many children collecting bottles from the garbage.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis study has highlighted how, as a result of drastic cuts in food aid, beneficiaries have seen a dramatic impact on their food security. Indeed, the increased reliance on unstainable coping strategies is a testament of how beneficiaries sacrifice long-term resilience for short-term survival.\n\nNeeding immediate solutions to cope with this shock and secure food, most vulnerable family members, such as children and women, are required to endure. Children being removed from school attests to how this shock will have long-standing impact on families.\n\nIn the few months after the cuts, households have relied on coping mechanisms and community support to sustain food consumption. However, these informal safety nets might also be affected since social relations and level of criminal activities worsened in some countries after the cuts.\n\nThe impact seen on food security, coping strategies used and the community all indicate a reduction in means available for households\u2019 resilience. As such, in the event of additional shocks, the imperative for humanitarian aid could increase to higher level than previously needed, driving the humanitarian community further away from addressing a Zero Hunger mandate.\n\nAs noticed within the study, beneficiaries experiencing a reduction in assistance and not finding satisfying livelihood opportunities also consider moving away from their communities. This highlights the importance of monitoring the chain reaction from cuts over time, but also across borders. Beneficiaries embarking on arduous journeys abroad could substantially increase the cost for donors who must support those beneficiaries at their countries\u2019 borders.\n\nWith alarmingly low funding forecasts, the need for WFP\u2019s assistance will continue to increase if additional cuts are implemented, as unsustainable coping strategies are used at the detriment of a household\u2019s ability to attain self-sufficiency. Country Offices experiencing funding cuts would thus benefit from implementing the appropriate study design, enabling them to better align their programmes and prioritization decisions to the impact felt by beneficiaries.\n\n4 Noted in Afghanistan, Syria, and Malawi For questions or more information, please contact: wfp.evidence@wfp.org Receive our latest evidence, data and analyses\n\nWorld Food Programme Via Cesare Giulio Viola 68/70, 00148 Rome, Italy - T +39 06 65131 wfp.org\n---\nANNEX 1: PRIORITIZATION CONTEXT AND STUDY DESIGN BY COUNTRY STUDIED\n\nPrioritization Decisions\n\nAfghanistan\n\nReduce ration size Reduce frequency Reduce beneficiaries\n\nFrom 75% to 50% ration size across country\n\nN/A\n\nCaseload reduced from 12M to 3.5M beneficiaries across country\n\nBeneficiaries cut Analysed group from caseload in September Study Design Strategies\n\nPanel data collection Control group Qualitative data Detailed country reports\n\nPanel data before and after cuts Beneficiaries kept in caseload Focus group discussions In progress\n\nANNEX 2: LESSONS LEARNT Best Practices | Study design \uf071Collect panel data from the same households over time whenever possible \uf071Ensure the questionnaire coding between panel survey rounds is consistent \uf071Collect data around the same time of year whenever possible, to control for seasonality Before the Cuts | Baseline data collection \uf071Plan for a large oversampling of deprioritized households to account for potential attrition \uf071Collect data on both prioritized and non- prioritized beneficiaries, also in follow-ups \uf071Train the enumerators on the background and purpose of the study\n\nBangladesh\n\nFrom 12USD to 8 USD transfer value for all beneficiaries in Cox\u2019s bazar\n\nN/A\n\nN/A All Rohingya beneficiaries in Cox\u2019s bazar\n\nPanel data with 4 years baseline N/A Focus group discussions and in- depth interviews In progress\n\nMalawi\n\nFrom 75% to 50% ration size for all beneficiaries in Dzaleka refugee camp\n\nN/A\n\nN/A Beneficiaries in Dzaleka refugee camp\n\nPanel data before and after cuts N/A Focus group discussions and in- depth interviews In progress\n\nSyria\n\nFrom 46% to 35-43% ration size across country Reduced based on vulnerability (4 tiers) in areas controlled by the Government of Syria (GoS).

        "content": "title: Rohingya Facing Existential Threat in Arakan \n content: JOINT STATEMENT\nOut of 600,000 Rohingya left in Arakan or Rakhine State after the genocidal attacks of 2016-2017, we estimate that only one third remain in their original homes.\nTens of thousands of Rohingya are internally displaced in Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships.\nRohingya in Buthidaung downtown were ordered to leave the town by 10 am on 18 May by the Arakan Army (AA). There was no fighting taking place in Buthidaung downtown. Late at night on 17 May, AA soldiers fired shots overhead to frighten people out of their homes, then looted and set fire to the houses. Thousands of Rohingya, including women, children and the elderly, were forced to flee for their lives. We condemn all the atrocities committed by the Arakan Army.\nDisplaced Rohingya have no food and shelter. The death toll will likely soon rise through starvation, lack of clean water and medical care. International humanitarian assistance is urgently needed.\nRohingya organisations today urge the international community to immediately put pressure on the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army to end mass forced displacement and human rights violations against Rohingya communities in Rakhine and to uphold international humanitarian law.\nThe international community must also robustly engage with the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army for the safe and unrestricted delivery of international humanitarian assistance to all communities, including the Rohingya, in the areas of Rakhine State under its control.\nWith the Burmese military restricting humanitarian aid deliveries from the areas of Burma which it occupies, we call on the government of Bangladesh to open up its borders for the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance into areas of northern Rakhine State which have been freed from military rule. International donors, UN agencies and INGOs must engage with the government of Bangladesh and the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army to enable the opening of this humanitarian lifeline.\nWe call on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation in Myanmar, and the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar to immediately begin investigations into the current crisis, with a view to publicly reporting on what is taking place and collecting evidence for future prosecutions to hold those responsible for human rights violations to account.\nWe call on the government of the United Kingdom to urgently convene a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss this current crisis and to call on the Arakan Army to end the mass forced displacement and human rights violations against Rohingya.\nWe remain disappointed that during the recent UN Security Council meeting on the situation in Rakhine State, an opportunity to try to prevent the current crisis was missed. Security Council members failed to address the regime\u2019s ongoing violations of the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice to protect the Rohingya. Likewise, they failed to call on the Arakan Army to abide by international law.\nWe propose a dialogue process including all ethnic and religious communities in Rakhine State, in order to work together for peaceful co-existence, effective administration and the economic development of Rakhine State as it is finally liberated from Burmese military rule.\nOnce again, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya are fleeing for their lives. Once again, the international community was warned about what could happen and failed to act. Now is not the time to hide behind claims that it is not clear what is going on or how complex the situation is. We have been here before. Now is the time for bold action.\nThe current situation in Buthidaung\nOn the morning of 17 May, fierce fighting between the AA and Myanmar military took place in the Rohingya village of Zabbar Fara (Tat Yar) to the south of Buthidaung town. Several Rohingya civilians were killed and injured, while others fled to Buthidaung downtown for safety.\nThe Arakan Army issued an order for all Rohingya to leave Buthidaung downtown by 10am on 18 May. Tens of thousands of Rohingya IDPs were seeking shelter in Buthidaung downtown after their villages came under attack in the preceding days and weeks.\nRohingya residents and IDPs refused to leave the town because they had nowhere else to go. Before the deadline had expired, Arakan Army soldiers surrounded the town. According to eyewitnesses, they fired shots overhead to frighten people out of their homes, then looted them before setting fire to them. Rohingya were forced to flee and seek shelter in nearby paddy fields for many hours. They were then directed by the Arakan Army to go to Hpon Nyo Leik and other villages that are in areas under Arakan Army control.\nIn the days prior to the arson attack on Buthidaung downtown, the Arakan Army is also reported to have launched artillery strikes and used drone bombs to attack the high school and hospital in Buthidaung town where Rohingya IDPs were taking shelter, resulting in deaths and injuries. Residents in Buthidaung downtown reported that Myanmar army soldiers, their proxies, and Rohingya forced recruits had already retreated to Maungdaw township before such attacks took place.\nThere have also been credible \u2013 but as yet unverified \u2013 reports of mass killings and mass abductions of Rohingya civilians, arson attacks and forced displacement of numerous villages in Buthidaung township by the Arakan Army in the days and weeks preceding the arson attack on Buthidaung town. Such atrocity crimes are alleged to have taken place in Tat Min Chaung, Kyauk Phyu Taung, Let Wei Dat Pyin Shay, Nga Kyin Tauk, Htan Shauk Khan, Pyar Pin Yin, Ywet Nyo Taung, Kun Daing and Da Pyu Chaung village tracts.\nDivide-and-rule strategy\nThe regime has employed its decades-old divide-and-rule strategy in Rakhine State to devastating effect. Since February, the Myanmar military has forcibly recruited several thousand Rohingya men from the detention camps in Sittwe and Kyaukphyu, as well as from villages in Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships. Due to the regime\u2019s freedom of movement restrictions on Rohingya communities, it is extremely difficult for Rohingya to flee or evade such orders. Rohingya forced recruits have been sent into battle with the AA and the regime is using them as cannon fodder. Hundreds are feared to have already been killed. Local media reports indicate that Rohingya conscripts are currently being used by the Myanmar military in their battles with the AA in Maungdaw and Thandwe. The AA has also forcibly recruited Rohingya in Buthidaung, Maungdaw and Minbya townships, although in smaller numbers.\nAt the same time, the regime has coerced Rohingya communities in Sittwe and Buthidaung to participate in protests it has organised to denounce the AA. The regime has used this for propaganda purposes to incite ethnic and religious hatred and violence towards the Rohingya.\nIn addition, the military is collaborating with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA), and Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO). Fighters from these groups are alleged to be fighting alongside the Myanmar military in its battles with the Arakan Army. Even more concerning are the credible reports that these groups are abducting Rohingya refugees from the camps in Bangladesh and trafficking them to Maungdaw to fight alongside the Myanmar military. We again totally reject ARSA, ARA, and RSO. Those groups do not represent or act on behalf of Rohingya communities. We condemn their actions unequivocally.\nIn April, reports emerged of the Myanmar military, along with Rohingya conscripts and members of ARSA committing arson attacks on Rakhine homes in Buthidaung. Similar reports emerged from Maungdaw in May. We wholeheartedly condemn such crimes. Their words and actions do not represent Rohingya communities. We understand only too well the pain of losing our homes and belongings in such attacks and we stand in complete solidarity with the Rakhine victims of such crimes.\nAgainst this backdrop, there has been an increase in the intensity of violations of international law and likely war crimes by the Arakan Army towards Rohingya, and a distinct shift in rhetoric. The ULA/AA leadership has repeatedly referred to Rohingya as \u2018Bengali\u2019, used in a derogatory manner to suggest that Rohingya are outsiders from Bangladesh, and \u2018Muslim extremists\u2019.\nAll armed groups must uphold international law\nInternational humanitarian law requires all parties to internal armed conflict to take precautionary measures to minimise harm to civilians and civilian objects. Parties must distinguish between combatants and civilians and between military and civilian objects, such as schools and hospitals. Reprisal attacks against civilians are prohibited in all circumstances, regardless of the behaviour of other parties to the conflict. Attacks against civilians and civilian objects and pillaging are prohibited and may constitute war crimes. Displacement of the civilian population can only be justified in exceptional circumstances such as to protect civilians from grave danger or for critical military reasons, which must be within the public\u2019s interest.\nRecommendations to the ULA/AA\nRohingya organisations urge the Arakan Army to immediately end human rights violations and mass forced displacement of Rohingya communities. We call for urgent dialogue with the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army to protect Rohingya civilians and resolve the current crisis.\nWe call on the leadership of the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army not to fall into the trap of the Burmese military playing divide and rule games and trying to set the people of Rakhine State against each other. Only the military regime will benefit from this.\nA free Rakhine State will forever be tainted in the eyes of the world if it begins with mass human rights violations. Just as ethnic people such as Rakhine do not want to be dominated or abused by Bamar, ethnic and religious minorities including Rohingya in Rakhine State do not want to be dominated and abused by Rakhine.\nRohingya want to live as equals in Arakan not under Burmese military rule. We want to live side by side in peaceful co-existence with the Rakhine and other diverse ethnic and religious communities, on equal terms, rooted in dignity and respect for our Rohingya identity. We want a seat at the table, not a separate state.\nBackground\nAround 600,000 survivors of the 2017 Rohingya genocide remain in Rakhine State. The largest population of an estimated 260,000 Rohingya is in Buthidaung township. Around 140,000 Rohingya are confined to detention camps in the coastal towns of Sittwe, Pauktaw, Myebon, and Kyaukphyu. Tens of thousands of Rohingya are in Maungdaw township, while other communities are concentrated in Rathedaung, Kyauktaw, Minbya, and Mrauk U.\nOn 27 October 2023, the Three Brotherhood Alliance comprised of the Arakan Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, and the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army launched Operation 1027 against the junta in northern Shan State. The alliance quickly made gains against the Myanmar military and has been credited with inspiring similar operations in other parts of the country. On 13 November, the Arakan Army turned its attentions to Rakhine State and launched attacks on the Myanmar military, even as Rakhine and Rohingya communities were struggling to recover from Cyclone Mocha. The AA has repeatedly stated that it will not stop fighting until it has gained complete control of the territory.\nAll parties to the conflict in Rakhine State have routinely violated international humanitarian law. Rohingya, Rakhine and other ethnic communities such as Mro and Kaman have suffered greatly. Hundreds of civilians have been killed by the regime\u2019s airstrikes and artillery shelling.\nThe Arakan Army has taken over nine of Rakhine State\u2019s 17 townships \u2013 Pauktaw, Minbya, Kyauktaw, Mrauk U, Myebon Ponnagyun, Ramree, Rathedaung and most recently, Buthidaung township in northern Rakhine State \u2013 as well as the northern part of Maungdaw township bordering Bangladesh. Fierce fighting is currently ongoing in Thandwe township to the south of the state and Maungdaw to the north.\nButhidaung and Maungdaw townships are heavily militarised. Myanmar military battalion bases are located nearby Rohingya villages in Buthidaung area, while in Maungdaw area Border Guard Police Battalion outposts are next to Rohingya villages. Rohingya villages have become battlegrounds as the Arakan Army has launched artillery attacks while the State Administration Council (SAC) has deployed airstrikes.\nAs the Arakan Army has taken over Buthidaung township, fighting is likely to further intensify in Maungdaw township in the coming days and weeks. There are concerning local media reports that the Myanmar military has deployed 500 additional troops from Light Infantry Division (LID) 22 to Maungdaw in recent days. During a previous outbreak of conflict in 2019, LID22 was accused of war crimes against Rakhine and Rohingya communities.\nInformation has been slow to emerge from Rakhine State due to the regime\u2019s rolling communication blackouts. Internet access and Myanmar mobile networks are largely cut off in most of northern Rakhine, heightening the risk of atrocity crimes. Intermittent, sporadic communication is occasionally possible with Rohingya who hold Bangladeshi sim cards, but the connection is generally very poor.\nSignatories:\nArakan Rohingya Development Association \u2013 Australia\nArakan Rohingya National Organisation (ARNO)\nArakan Rohingya Union (ARU)\nAustralian Burmese Rohingya Organization\nBritish Rohingya Community UK\nBurmese Rohingya Association in Japan (BRAJ)\nBurmese Rohingya Association in Queensland- Australia (BRAQA)\nBurmese Rohingya Association of North America (BRANA)\nBurmese Rohingya Community in Denmark (BRCD)\nBurmese Rohingya Community Netherlands (BRCNL)\nBurmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK)\nBurmeses Rohingya Community of Georgia, Atlanta (BRCG)\nCanadian Burmese Rohingya Organisation\nEuropean Rohingya Council (ERC)\nFree Rohingya Coalition (FRC)\nLos Angeles Rohingya Association\nRohingya Action Ireland\nRohingya American Council (RAC)\nRohingya Association of Canada\nRohingya Centre Canada\nRohingya Community in Japan (RCJ)\nRohingya Community in Norway (RCN)\nRohingya Human Rights Initiative\nRohingya Human Rights Network\nRohingya Organisation Norway (RON)\nRohingya Women Development Network-RWDN\nRW Welfare Society (RWWS)\nSwedish Rohingya Association (SRA)\nFor more information, please contact:\nTun Khin: +44 78 8871 4866\nNay San Lwin: +49 176 6213 9138",

        "content": "title: Situation Report: \n content: Situation Report:\n\nApril 2024\n\nWHO Cox\u2019s Bazar: Rohingya Emergency Crisis Coordination and Leadership\n\nThe second Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) report, a pivotal document reflecting the current state of health services and resources at the camp level, was finalised after a comprehensive data validation and verification process from December 2023 to February 2024. This critical endeavour, supported by the WHO Headquarters\u2019 HeRAMS initiative team, provides insights into service availability, and identifies service gaps and barriers. The health sector team\u2019s diligent review and incorporation of feedback ensured the report\u2019s accuracy, leading to its publication and distribution among all health sector partners and relevant stakeholders. The WHO-led health sector\u2019s focal point of April\u2019s activities was their commitment to coordination and strategic planning, exemplified by regular monthly meetings at Cox\u2019s Bazar and field levels. The Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) convened a vital meeting, prioritizing the completion of the Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) for Sector/Cluster Coordination, Performance Monitoring, and Referrals. Moreover, the regular Working Group (WG) meetings played a significant role in keeping partners updated on the latest developments. The Community Health Working Group (CHWG) carried out a Head Lice prevalence survey through Community Based Surveillance (CBS), supported technically by Epi WG and WHO. The initiative uncovered that 35% of the camp\u2019s population was affected by Head Lice. Notably, female children under five years of age had the highest infestation rates. The surveillance also found that females had a notably higher infestation rate at 48%, compared to 21% for males. In response to these findings, a Mass Drug Administration (MDA) commenced on May 5th and is set to conclude by May 16th, 2024, aiming to treat around 196,000 high-risk individuals. The enhancement of evidence-based decision-making for the prevention and response to sexual misconduct stood at the forefront of the WHO Multisectoral Technical Consultation in Geneva on April 18-19, 2024. This pivotal hybrid event, orchestrated by WHO Headquarters brought together a diverse array of researchers and expert practitioners across multiple sectors. Their collaborative efforts focused on strengthening system wide PSEA work, addressing challenges and opportunities in PRSM work, advocating for the integration of a Victim and Survivor Centred Approach, and drawing on insights from the UN SEA Survey and other SEA Risk\n\nPage 1\n---\nAssessments to inform PRSM decision-making. Further, the consultation underscored the transformative role of leadership and organizational culture in fostering sustainable changes in behaviour and culture.\n\nInformation Management and Epidemiology\n\nDengue Fever: In the current reporting period, the weekly patterns of confirmed Dengue Fever incidents have largely stayed within the anticipated baseline levels, except for week 14 which recorded a single confirmed fatality due to Dengue Fever, yet the Case Fatality Rate has remained under 1%. The typical pattern of endemic occurrence is anticipated to persist throughout this dry season until the onset of the rainy season in May 2024. The efforts to raise awareness and disseminate Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) messages to the public may have also played a role in reducing the number of cases reported in April 2024. Diphtheria: During the period under review, there were no confirmed cases or deaths from Diphtheria, maintaining a case-fatality ratio of less than 1%. This achievement is likely due to the enhanced immunity across the population, resulting from the effective Diphtheria immunisation campaign in the latter part of 2023, which achieved a 95% vaccination rate. Moreover, prompt surveillance and the organised and collaborative case management efforts by WHO and health sector partners have been instrumental. Cholera: In April, Cholera transmission was detected in samples tested from 02 of the 24 sentinel sites that consistently perform Rapid Diagnostic Testing (RDT) for suspected Cholera cases. There were no confirmed deaths due to Cholera. The combined WASH sector surveillance and response teams, operating under the Joint Assessment and Response Teams (JARTs), continue to monitor and coordinate Cholera response efforts in the camps. COVID-19 transmission has been substantially curtailed in the Rohingya Refugee Camps and the adjacent host communities across all eight Upazilas of Cox\u2019s Bazar. Nonetheless, a slight level of transmission is still observed within the Rohingya Refugee population, whereas it has been fully halted among the host communities during this timeframe. With no deaths recorded, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has stayed at zero per cent for this period. The number of cases reported in April has decreased by 50% compared to those reported in March 2024 Skin Diseases: The weekly consultation rates for skin infections have been declining throughout April, mirroring the trend observed in March 2024. This decrease may be largely credited to the effective Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaign against scabies that was conducted in December 2023.\n\nPage 2\n---\nImmunisation\n\nIn April 2024, the immunization team successfully delivered over 55,000 doses of various vaccines to children below two years of age. Specifically, the month saw the administration of 20,043 doses of the Polio vaccine including the first to third doses of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and the first and second doses of the inactivated Polio Vaccine (fIPV). Further, 6,265 doses of the Measles vaccine were given, covering the first and second doses of the Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine.\n\nHealth operations & technical (response)\n\nEssential Lab Services The laboratory team equipped five health facilities within the camps with HbA1c analysers and delivered practical training on-site to the lab staff. Throughout April, a total of 551 HbA1c tests were performed across 37 health facilities in the camp. The lab team completed 10 rounds of supportive supervision and monitored the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Further, to support the Hepatitis C surveillance efforts, 59 Hepatitis C Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) positive samples were collected for viral load testing. Infection Prevention and Control The IPC team undertook supervisory visits to evaluate the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures at healthcare establishments in the Ukhiya and Teknaf camps over the month. A total of five healthcare facilities were inspected, including three primary healthcare centers and two health posts. The primary goal of these visits is to identify any IPC shortcomings and provide additional support where needed. Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) Services To support treatment adherence in the Rohingya refugee camps, WHO has backed four health sector partners with the necessary NCD diagnostics and medicines, adhering to the national protocol. The focus was on managing Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, and Chronic Respiratory Diseases. During the reported period, WHO distributed a significant quantity of medications, including 86,000 tablets of Amlodipine 5 mg, 29,792 tablets of Losartan 50 mg, 4,500 tablets of Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, 85,000 tablets of Metformin 500 mg, 13,000 tablets of Gliclazide 80 mg, 6,580 tablets of Aspirin 75 mg, 41,384 tablets of Rosuvastatin 5 mg, and 9,100 inhalers of Salbutamol.\n\nPage 3\n---\nHealth operations & technical (Services)\n\nRisk Communication and Community Engagement To protect public health amidst heatwave conditions, the Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) plan has been established with essential information on heatwaves. This plan has been tailored and shared within Rohingya communities following the approval from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). The dissemination of these messages is being carried out through various methods, including printed posters, door-to-door visits, community awareness sessions, and the involvement of community leaders to ensure widespread awareness. Reproductive Mother Newborn Child Adolescent Health (RMNCAH) Interagency joint SRH monitoring and supportive supervision framework: The ongoing process includes regular quarterly evaluations of health facilities to confirm their preparedness for Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) services, as well as to improve the standard of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services. During the reporting period, WHO carried out these evaluative assessments at a primary health care centre in Camp 1 East and conducted a supportive supervisory visit to a primary health care centre in Camp 3. Facility based Maternal and perinatal death audits: WHO maintained its support for the Sexual and Reproductive Health Working Group (SRH WG) and the Maternal and Perinatal Mortality Surveillance and Response (MPMSR) sub-committee by regularly auditing all facility-based maternal and perinatal fatalities. In April, WHO was involved in two maternal death audits, following which action plans were formulated at the facility level to address and rectify the shortcomings found. Tuberculosis (TB): During the specified timeframe, TB field assistants made house calls to approximately 471 households in the Ukhiya and Teknaf Rohingya camps. A total of 859 Rohingya individuals were screened for tuberculosis (TB) through these home visits. Additionally, 34 health education sessions were held, reaching 396 people to raise awareness about TB in the community and at partner facilities in the camps. 209 individuals suspected of having TB were identified and referred to the nearby National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) supported BRAC facility for further testing. The team also visited 34 TB-positive patients as part of the TB-DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) monitoring program. Furthermore, a TB officer completed six supportive supervisions to oversee the TB-related activities of field staff in Ukhiya (Camps: 07, 09, 12, 14, 15) and Teknaf (Camps: 24, 26). On April 29, 2024, the TB officer, with the National Professional Officer for TB (WCO) inspected various BRAC TB labs and partner facilities in Camps 11 and 15 to monitor on-site TB activities. They also visited the homes of patients with Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) as a part of the treatment monitoring process.\n\nPage 4\n---\nWASH and Healthcare Waste Management Supportive supervisions were conducted at four medical centres within the Ukhiya camps. These inspections included conversations with medical staff regarding WASH and HCWM topics. In addition, WASH-FIT initiatives received supervisory support. The inspections revealed a lack of HCWM-related IEC materials and a shortage of PPE for waste handlers and cleaning staff. Health partners have completed a self-assessment within the medical sector. This assessment has been analysed to pinpoint deficiencies in training and PPE usage. The insights gained will guide future strategic planning. WHO has initiated the distribution of HCWM-IEC resources to Health Sector Partners to promote secure HCWM and WASH practices. The distribution process is ongoing, and thus far, 80 medical facilities across different camps have been supplied with these resources. Two supervisory field visits were carried out in the refugee camps. These visits involved using a checklist to tackle observed issues and challenges, accompanied by immediate briefings and implementation of solutions as needed. Moreover, a self-evaluation was performed to determine healthcare waste management requirements and shortcomings within the camps. Subsequent actions will be aligned with the principal observations from this assessment.\n\nAdministration, finance, and logistics\n\nOperations Support and Logistics As part of the HGSP project, the Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) team transported and distributed 6.89 cubic meters of Health Care Waste management supplies to seven Upazila Health complexes. This effort is crucial for health protection, environmental safety, legal compliance, community impact, and operational efficiency. The team gathered and compiled supply demands from partners, aiding the technical team in ensuring the proper clearance of these items. In response to identified needs, the OSL team provided health sector partners with three SAM kits, capable of treating 150 children with severe and mild malnutrition. Further, the WHO logistics team supplied nine IEHK basic kits to three health sector partners potentially serving 9,000 primary patients. For routine surveillance purposes, WHO distributed 6,185 RDTs for diseases including malaria, dengue, and hepatitis B, C, & E to 14 partners.\n\nPage 5\n---\nFurthermore, the OSL team contributed to budget estimation and preparation for a lice MDA campaign in the Rohingya Refugee camps. The team has been consistently aiding technical teams in monitoring the delivery of supplies. In April alone, the OSL team processed 22 distinct requests. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) In the previous month, the IT team successfully set up a new server room adhering to BMS standards. Subsequently, they installed essential network components, including a Firewall, Core Switch, and Hyper- Visor server, in this specialized area. These elements were integrated flawlessly with our existing network. This key development has enabled our office to operate independently, eliminating the need for the former Ethernet over IP (EoIP) tunnel link with the WCO. As a direct consequence of these enhancements, there has been a notable uptick in the efficiency and reliability of the WHO Cox\u2019s Bazar office\u2019s intranet and internet services.\n\nPage 6\n---\nReferences:\n\n\uf0a7 Emergency response framework \u2013 2nd ed.

Flooding and mud slide events occurred during the month that reduced to access to essential commodities and facilities. Furthermore, the events lead to lose of human life/livestock,\n\nproperties (crops, households\u2019 items and tourists\u2019 utilities) and livelihood coping strategies.\n\nConsequently, there more than 500 households that were displaced and infrastructures destroyed. 7.2 Migration \u2022 Migrations within the wards and county owed fear of pests and diseases, emergency of waterborne diseases, flooding and other rains related risks/hazards.\n\n7.3 FOOD SECURITY PROGNOSIS- APRIL 2024 - MAY 2024 \u25aa Based on Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD)Weather Forecast for March April May (MAM) 2024 season issued on 29th February 2024, it is expected that the onset would continue from February throughout the season. The expected rainfall is likely to be above the long-term average amounts for the season (enhanced rainfall). The distribution of the rainfall is likely to be good in time and space. Moreover, according KMD May 2024 weather forecast released on 30th April 2024 indicates that rainfall is expected throughout the month which is likely to be above average with occasional storms. Furthermore, flooding events in low-lying and flood plains is likely to be experience across the county. \u25aa Water for livestock and household use would be available in May 2024 due to rainfall recharge however it would be hindered by high siltation levels that has been persistent overtime leading to high turbidity while rangelands are expected to remain stable as result of extended rains. \u25aa Livestock productivity is likely to improve in areas with forecasted amounts of rains. As result, of the stated indicators positive impact on food security would be realized. \u25aa The prices of staple food commodities are likely to remain higher than the long-term average this would necessitate unfavourable terms of trade which would be short-lived. \u25aa Household food consumption patterns are likely to worsen due depletion of household stock and high food prices hence reducing households in borderline and poor food consumption scores. This would lead to increased household population in stressed and crisis (food based and livelihood change) copying strategies with very few shifting to emergency copying strategies.\n\n| 11\n---\nIncreased livestock mortality due to floods, pests and diseases would continue to be exhibited based on the prevailing weather conditions.\n\n8.0 RECOMMENDATIONS Immediate/Short term National Government, County Government and Development partners to collaborate on: SECTOR INTERVENTION TARGET ESTIMATED\n\n|    | 0                    | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 2                                               | 3                                | 4     | 5      | 6    | 7           |   8 |\n|----|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------|--------|------|-------------|-----|\n|  0 | SECTOR               | INTERVENTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | TARGET AREA                                     | ESTIMATED COST (Ksh.) in Million |       |        |      |             | nan |\n|  1 | Livestock            | Intensive disease control for endemic notifiable diseases in migratory routes and watering points.

The county received enhanced rainfall with good distribution in time and space during the month. The average cumulative amount for the first two dekads was 129.06 mm, which is 145% of the long- term average for the period (Figure 1). Moreover, isolated episodes of very heavy rainfall during the third dekad were experienced in Kamukuru, Shompole, Figure 1: Rainfall Performance, April 2024 Source: WFP-VAM Nguruman, Pakase, Loodokilani, Mashenai and Ewuaso in Kajiado West; Gataka, Kware, Mithika, and Rongai in Kajiado North; Kitengela, and Olturoro in Kajiado East. As a consequence, the Athi river, Olkejuado, Ewuaso Nyiro, Elangata Wuas, Kimalat, Enkirgirri, Kisaju, Oloosuyian and other rivers broke their banks and flooded into the vicinity. An estimated 1,100 households in Shompole, Pakase, Ngurumani, Loika, Entasopia, 300 households in Gataka, Kware, Mithika, and 55 in Kamukuru were displaced, and several were affected across the county. At least 100 goats and sheep drowned across the county, 2 elephants drowned in Shompole, while over 25 and 130 acres of maize, bean, and tomato crops were destroyed by floods respectively in Kajiado east and south. Flood damage equally caused several roads across the county, particularly in Kajiado West, East, and Central, to be impassable. The Kiserian-Magadi road is currently closed due to flood damage.\n\nThe county government and the Kenya Red Cross provided humanitarian assistance, however, there are still gaps in the response actions. Stakeholders are urged to work together, while residents in riparian areas are advised to evacuate risk zones and the public cautioned against walking or crossing flooded roads and terrains during heavy rains.\n\n2.0 IMPACTS ON VEGETATION AND WATER 2.1 Vegetation Condition Index The vegetation condition index (VCI) compares the current state of the vegetation to the state at same period in previous years. In April, the vegetation condition across the county though reduced, remained far above-normal for similar time of the year with an actual value of over 80 Kajiado Drought Monitoring Early Warning Bulletin - April 2024 Page 2 of 15\n---\n(Figure 2). The favorable rains received at the end of 2023 and the ongoing long rains ensured proper soil moisture for vegetation growth. However, as a result of the heavy rainfall experienced during the month, soil erosion and land degradation occurred, with trees being uprooted and vegetation destroyed by raging floods and overflown rivers across the county.\n\nFigure 2: 3-monthly VCI; Kajiado, April 2024 2.2 Pasture and Browse Condition As the season progresses with enhanced\n\nrainfall, pasture and browse have experienced\n\nsignificant rejuvenation across the county. The key informants interviewed reported a 38 percent above normal pasture and browse conditions, whereas 62 percent reported normal conditions.\n\nThe availability of pastures, and browse resources implies accessibility of grazing resources for livestock and wildlife for the next five months. However, the accessibility of pasture is being\n\nthreatened by Ipomea, Mexican Poppy, and Mathenge weeds, as well as by raging floods. Standing waters have the potential to destroy some pasture species, causing isolated animals to\n\neat contaminated or even poisonous plants. The recovery process can be hindered by the deep sedimentation of silt, sand, or gravel deposits on pastures and the erosion of topsoil as floodwaters recede.\n\n2.3 2.3.1\n\nWater Access and Utilization Water Sources\n\nIn April, water availability across the county was enhanced following the ongoing above average rainfall. The underground water recharge, along with roof catchments, 90 percent to 100 percent recharge of open sources such as pans, dams, ponds, pools in open fields, and\n\nrock catchments, resulted in increased access to water for both domestic and\n\nFigure 3: Water sources; Kajiado County, April 2024 Kajiado Drought Monitoring Early Warning Bulletin - April 2024\n\nPage 3 of 15\n---\nlivestock consumption across all livelihood zones. This was indicated by increased use of pans and dams, reduced water tracking and traditional river wells (Figure 3). The increased rainfall had some adverse effects, including increased siltation and sedimentation in certain rivers and dams, river channel overflows, urban flooding, flash floods, and impeding water distribution channels. Damage and destruction to water and sanitation infrastructures, potential pollution and contamination of surface and groundwater sources. Water sources could last for four to five months, but quality monitoring is essential during this period.\n\n2.3.2\n\nWater Access and Utilization by Households The average return trekking distance to water sources decreased to its historical\n\nlowest since 2016, with an average of 2.3 kilometres in April. This was 54 and 49\n\npercent shorter than the five-year average and the wet year (Figure 4). Across all livelihood zones, water consumption per\n\nperson per day was generally within normal ranges. Water was mostly free,\n\nFigure 4: Return distance from homestead to water points; Kajiado County, April 2024\n\nhowever, for those charged at the source, it costed Ksh 5 per 20-litre jerrycan,\n\nwhile vendors charged Ksh 20 per 20-litre jerrycan depending on the distance.\n\n2.3.3\n\nLivestock Access to Water\n\nSupported by two consecutive wetter- than-normal rainfall seasons, during April, the average distance to water sources from the grazing field was 2.0 kilometres (Figure 5). This was less than the minimum value of 2.7 kilometres for the last ten years. Compared to the five- year and wet year averages for a similar period of the year, the current distance\n\nwas Figure 5: Return distance from grazing fields to water points; Kajiado County, April 2024 Kajiado Drought Monitoring Early Warning Bulletin - April 2024\n\nand\n\n53 percent Page 4 of 15\n\nshorter,\n---\nrespectively. The average distance to water sources from the grazing field was significantly less than average in all livelihood zones. Livestock are being watered daily in all livelihood zones.\n\n3.0 PRODUCTION INDICATORS 3.1 Livestock Production 3.1.1 Livestock Body Condition Owing to the abundance of pasture, browse, and water, livestock body conditions have improved\n\nsteadily since September 2023. By March, the body condition of all livestock species had abundant fat cover on either side of the tailhead and smooth in appearance across all livelihood\n\nzones. Livestock body condition serves as a useful indicator to monitor livestock productivity with respect to current grazing programs. In April, the body condition was above normal for a similar period of the year, and is expected remain to remain so for the next five to six months.\n\n3.1.2 Livestock Mortalities Although drought is not expected to cause livestock mortalities currently, floods in Kajiado's west, east, and central sub-counties caused the deaths of over 100 sheep and goats in April.\n\n3.1.3 Livestock Diseases The presence of endemic and notifiable livestock diseases was reported across the county, including Food and Mouth Disease (FMD), Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), and Contagious Bovine Pleuro Pneumonia (CBPP), sheep and goat pox and Blue Tongue Disease. The prolonged humidity due to enhanced rainfall favours the survival of bacteria and viruses and fosters the spread of pests and diseases, posing threats to livestock e.g. foot rot, Rift Valley Fever (RVF) among others. The stress of flooding means cows and ewes are more likely to give birth early. The survival of other parasites may be enhanced in wet conditions and lead to problems in the next grazing season.\n\n3.1.4 Livestock Migration There have been no reports of livestock migrations due to drought, but livestock in Kamukuru, Oloosuyian, Mashenani, Shompole, Ngurumani, Pakase, and Entasopia have been moved to\n\nhigher grounds within the same locations due to flooding caused by the ongoing heavy rains. Given the availability of pasture and water, there will be no livestock migration due to drought in the next four to five months.\n\nPage 5 of 15\n---\n3.1.5\n\nMilk Production\n\nThe average household daily milk production improved by 10% from the previous month to 3.2 litres in April (Figure 6). The improvement in milk production is not only due to good body conditions but also the increasing number of lactating herds, improved yield level per livestock occasioned by forage and\n\nwater availability within shorter trekking distances. The five-year average for a Figure 6: Household\u2019s average daily milk production, similar time of the year was 2.9 litres per Kajiado County, April 2024 day. Milk production in the agro-pastoral livelihood zone was 6.2 litres and 3.3 litres in pastoral livelihood zones. The difference was due to the existence of superior breads in agro-pastoral areas compared to pastoral areas. Further improvements in milk production are expected in the next two months due to the availability of pasture and water.\n\n3.2 Rain-Fed Crop Production Following heavy rains in April across the county, the crops were in good to fair condition. The\n\ncrops in Kaputie West, Matepes, Nasipa, Kenyewa-poka, Oloosirkon, and Sholinke were fair because of waterlogging and flooding on farms. Weeding and flood management was the main\n\nagricultural activity for most farmers as the maize crops were knee high and the beans had four to six leaves. The heavy rains have seen water logging, soil erosion and nutrient leaching on\n\nfarms and a likely increase in crops pests and diseases due to high humidity, coupled with warmer than average temperatures, which could affect the average yield for the long rain season.\n\n4.0 MARKET PERFORMANCE 4.1 Livestock Marketing The ongoing rains caused disruptions in some markets during the month. Flooding caused Kamukuru, Enkorika, Torosei, Kiserian, Shompole, Isinya, Namanga, Kitengela, and Ewuaso to\n\nbe inaccessible at certain points. The Magadi-Kiserian road remained closed by the end of the month. Kamukuru and Shompole are submerged in floods, while several roads are muddy, waterlogged, and impassable.\n\nPage 6 of 15\n---\n4.1.1\n\nCattle Prices\n\nThe average price for a medium-sized bull sold in April was Ksh. 47,346, which was 23 and 54 percent above the wet year and the five-year averages, respectively (Figure 7). The steady increase in cattle prices is a result of the good season performance, which enhanced forage, water conditions, and livestock body conditions. Furthermore, the market's\n\nMean Wet Dry 2024 livestock population remains low, which is currently exacerbated by poor market Figure 7: Prices of cattle; Kajiado County, April 2024 access due to floods. The average selling price of a medium-sized bull was Ksh. 46,961 in\n\npastoral areas, and Ksh. 48,500 in agro-pastoral areas. For the next four months, it is expected\n\nthat cattle prices will remain stable above the three-year average.\n\n4.1.2\n\nGoats Prices\n\nThe market's low supply and high demand drove the prices of medium-sized two- year-old goats to continuously improve. In April, the average price for a medium- sized two-year-old goat was Ksh. 7,654, which is 6 and 48 percent higher than the previous month and the three-year average for the same period of the year, respectively (Figure 8). In addition to a healthy body condition, the key\n\ninformants reported an increase in Figure 8: Prices of goats; Kajiado County, April 2024 demand for goat meat exportation at the end of Ramathan. Furthermore, pastoralists are mainly restocking small stocks because cattle are still too expensive, and due to poor market access, goat prices have increased significantly. In Enkorika (Agro-pastoral), the same goat was sold for Ksh. 5,000 compared to Ksh. 10,000 in Loodokilani (Pastoral).\n\nPage 7 of 15\n---\n4.2 4.2.1\n\nPrices of Cereals and Legumes Maize Prices\n\nA\n\nkilogram of maize\n\ndropped\n\nby\n\npercent from March to Ksh 65. in April (Figure 9). The current price was 7 percent cheaper than the three-year average at this time of year. The bumper harvest following favourable short rains performance both locally and from neighbouring counties led to an increase in market volumes, thereby lowering prices. Traders also cited the decline in\n\npump prices, even though still elevated Figure 9: Prices of maize; Kajiado County, April 2024 relative to the same period last year, and the recent appreciation of the Kenya shilling as driving factors to reduced prices. In Loitoktok (mixed farming south), a kilogram of maize was sold for Ksh. 40 while in Ewuaso (pastoral west), the same was sold for Ksh. 90. Despite the expected improvements, factors such as floods, which have devastated croplands and compromised food productivity in agricultural zones in the county, both in the present and future, suggest a possible shortage of food, which could lead to cascading impacts on food prices. In addition, flood damage has caused numerous roads and markets in the county to be either destroyed or inaccessible, which will have an impact on basic food prices and market functionality.\n\n4.2.2 Beans Prices April saw a 4 percent decrease in the average retail price of beans to Ksh. 131 per kilogram, as shown in Figure 10. The price of beans is currently 15% higher than the five-year average for the same time of year. Like maize, bean prices were reduced due to supply and demand dynamics, and were threatened by similar reasons as in maize. The average price of a kilogram of beans in Figure 10: Prices of beans; Kajiado County, April 2024 Kajiado Drought Monitoring Early Warning Bulletin - April 2024 Page 8 of 15\n---\nthe pastoral south was Ksh. 70, whereas in the pastoral west, it was sold for Ksh. 160.\n\n4.3 Milk Prices The price of fresh unprocessed milk dropped by 5 percent to Ksh. 63 per litre in April, with minimal differences among livelihood zones. This was due to increased milk production\n\nsupported by increased pasture resulting from favourable rainfall and improvements in lactating animals. The three-year average for a similar time of the year was Ksh 53. per litre. While the\n\nongoing above-average rainfall is broadly facilitating livestock reproduction and milk production, the ongoing floods and the likelihood of elevated disease incidence are expected to have negative impacts on some affected households.\n\n4.4\n\nTerms of Trade\n\nThe average terms of trade improved by 16 percent from previous month to 118\n\nkilograms of maize per sale of a goat, exceeding the wet year average of 112\n\nkilograms (Figure 11). In the pastoral areas, households exchanged 133\n\nkilograms of maize for their goat sales, as opposed to agro-pastoral areas that\n\nexchanged 80 kilograms of maize for the same goat. Average livestock prices were\n\nhigher in pastoral areas. The adverse Figure 11: Terms of trade; Kajiado County, April 2024 effects of the ongoing heavy rains could have negative impacts on terms of trade, which could result in a reduction in the succeeding months.\n\n5.0 FOOD CONSUMPTION AND NUTRITION STATUS 5.1 Milk Consumption From figure 12, households consumed 2.5 litres of milk per day in April, which was less than the wet-year average of 2.7 litres per day, but 10 percent above the five-year average for this time of year. In all livelihood zones, livestock were in their usual wet season grazing areas with good health, which resulted in increased production and consumption. The increase in milk consumption was equally attributed to the flooding situation which has affected market access for alternative household food stuff. The low total livestock units following drought losses was Kajiado Drought Monitoring Early Warning Bulletin - April 2024 Page 9 of 15\n---\nattributed\n\nto\n\nmilk\n\nconsumption\n\nbeing\n\nlower compared to expectations for a wet year. The pastoral households consumed an average of 2.4 litres per day compared to 3.7 litres in agro-pastoral livelihood zones. The variation was attributed to significant production in agro pastoral areas compared to pastoral areas which have also experience more flooding\n\nespecially in Magadi, Keekonyokia, Figure 12: Household milk consumption; Kajiado County, April 2024 Loodokilani, Lenkism, Amboseli, and\n\nEwuaso. The ongoing flooding is expected to affect milk production and consumption, but there\n\nis a possibility of recovery once the floodwaters recede.\n\n5.2\n\nFood Consumption Score\n\nThe season's food consumption trend has improved, which indicates an increase in\n\nthe variety and frequency food groups. By April\n\nof different 2024, the\n\nproportion of pastoral households that fell under borderline food consumption\n\nscores reduced to 6.8 percent from 8.8 percent in March while agro-pastoral\n\nareas improved to acceptable food consumption scores (Figure 13). The\n\nFigure 13: Food consumption; Kajiado County, Feb-Apr improvements were attributed to improved livestock productivity resulting in an improvement of the household purchasing power and access to food. Increased access to milk and favourable terms of trade are helping to mitigate the effects of flooding due to the ongoing enhanced rainfall.\n\nPage 10 of 15\n---\n5.3 5.3.1\n\nHealth And Nutrition Status Nutrition Status of Children Aged 6-59 Months As household food availability and access\n\nimprove, the proportion of children under five years at risk of malnutrition has gradually decreased, reaching 7.1% in April (Figure 14). The factors that contributed to this trend were stable milk consumption, access to cereals, and a rise in households' purchasing power due to improved livestock productivity. The\n\nfive-year average for this time of year is\n\nFigure 14: % of U5 at risk of malnutrition; Kajiado 8.0%. Malnutrition among children is a County, April 2024 major concern in pastoral and flooded areas of Ngurumani, Shompole, Magadi, Pakase, Kamukuru, Lenkism, Losinyai, Nkama, Leremis, Kijiji, Kware, Mithika, Gataka, Enkoirorei, Maparasha, Emotoroki, and Noonkujet.\n\n5.3.2 Health There were no reported cases of human disease outbreaks in April. However, in Dalalekutuk, Ewuaso Kidong, Mbirikani, and Oldonyonyokie, 77% of the under-five children monitored across the county who were sick had fever with chills like malaria, while 23 percent had diarrhea. The contamination of drinking water sources caused by floods is likely to lead to the increase of waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhoea. Disruptions in health services are likely due to floods submerging health facilities or destruction of access roads leading to such facilities. In flood-prone areas, mental health issues may arise from displacement and destruction of property.\n\n5.4 Coping Strategies Index Since January this year, there has been a gradual decline in the average coping strategy index, which indicates that households are less stressed when getting food or money to buy it. The\n\naverage coping strategy index in April was 5.7, which was 7 and 13 percent lower than the previous month and the five-year average, respectively (Figure 15). The improvement was attributed to availability of cereals at household level following good harvest, improved\n\nPage 11 of 15\n---\npurchasing power and the above-average long rains driving increased agricultural\n\nwage labor opportunities and incomes. The primary way households coped was\n\nFigure 1: Coping strategy index; Kajiado, April 2024\n\nby eating less preferred food. Floods and flash floods have led to the destruction of\n\nproperties, loss of lives, displacement of people, and disruption of market access\n\nwhich may constrain household food access, forcing households to apply\n\nlivelihood and consumption-based coping strategies in the coming months.\n\n6.0 FOOD SECURITY PROGNOSIS Increased rainfall in the county led to better agricultural production, and wages which will\n\nincrease access to food, water, and pasture, lower food commodity prices, and improve nutrition. Due to the above-average rainfall, particularly in April, the county experienced destructive\n\nflooding in several areas. River bursts and excessive rains led to floods and flash floods, which resulted in at least 100 sheep/goats drowning, over 187 hectares of farmland damaged, several\n\nhouseholds affected, with over 2,000 displaced. Structural damage including roads such as Mile 46-Singiraine-Kamukuru, Kajiado-Mile 46, Elangata Wuas -Kilonito, Mashenani-Eselenkei,\n\nAthi River-Namanga and Oltepesi-Magadi temporarily closed by KeNHA, Oloyiankalani- Tikoishi, Noormirran-Suswa, Ewuaso-Najile. Bridges included Oloyiankalani-Tikoishi, Rongai-\n\nKiserian. Hospital/School included Entasopia hospital and Eroreti pry school. Markets submerged in water included Kamukuru, Torosei, Shompole and ACK Entasopia church.\n\nAs suppliers find new market routes, staple food prices are expected to rise while displacement, loss of household assets, and damage to key infrastructure, are likely to lead to mental health\n\nissues due to stress. Standing waters have the potential to destroy some pasture species, contaminate or led to poisonous plants. The recovery process can be impeded by the heavy\n\nsettling of silt, sand, or gravel deposits on fields and the loss of topsoil. The prolonged humidity favours the survival of bacteria and viruses and fosters the spread of pests and diseases, posing\n\nthreats to livestock. The heavy rains have submerged various crop farms in water, caused soil erosion and nutrient leaching and a likely increase in crops pests and diseases which could affect\n\nPage 12 of 15\n---\nthe average yield for the long rain season leading to cascading impacts on food prices. Possible contamination of drinking water sources caused by floods is likely to lead to the increase of waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhoea. Disruptions in health services are likely due to floods submerging health facilities or destruction of access roads leading to such facilities. Thus, the stability of food security situation in the county is not certain even with the good season\u2019s performance. Humanitarian assistance, flood sensitization and structural repairs are urgently required.\n\n7.0 CURRENT INTERVENTIONS 7.1 Ongoing Interventions/Activities \u2022 Development of 3No. Model-Community micro-project proposals: By National Drought Management Authority. \u2022 Strengthening/Development of grazing plans and grazing bylaws in Kuku, Rombo, Mbirikani: By National Drought Management Authority, and County Government. \u2022 Vitamin A supplementation and deworming across the county: By County Department of Health. \u2022 Humanitarian assistance to over 1,000 households in different villages in Magadi ward: By County Government, and Red Cross. \u2022 Aircraft evacuation from flooded terrain to higher ground and food assistance to over 350 households in Shompole: By Airbus Foundation, County Government, and Red Cross. \u2022 Rapid assessments and rescued operation of flood victims across the county: By Red Cross.\n\n8.0 RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE RESPONSE OPTIONS \u2022 Risk assessments, including flood risk assessments, rescue operation, evacuation drills and simulations, and humanitarian assistance: By County Government, National Government, Red Cross, and Partners. \u2022 Tree planting campaign across the county: By County Government, National Government, Red Cross, and Partners. \u2022 Inspect critical infrastructures and monitor water levels in reservoirs to ensure preparedness: By County Government, National Government, Red Cross, and Partners. \u2022 Sensitization and capacity building of farmers on pasture harvesting and conservation; By County Department of Livestock Production and Partners.\n\nPage 13 of 15\n---\nScale up surveillance of human, crops and livestock diseases and pests; By County Department of Public Health, Agriculture, Veterinary, and Partners.\n\nScale up integrated health outreaches and availing therapeutic foods for malnourished children; By County Department of Health and Partners.\n\nUpscaling vaccination and treatment of LSD, RVF, BT, PPR, S&G, CCPP and other flood- prone diseases across the county; By County Department of Veterinary and Partners.\n\nProvide water treatment chemicals to communities that draw water from open water sources and promote education on (WASH) practices; By County Department of Health and Partners.\n\nSensitize farmers to implement soil conservation measures and embrace sustainable land management practices as part of their agricultural strategies; By County Department Agriculture and Partners.\n\nTable 1.
