Modest improvements in market conditions in April were reversed in May 2024 following the Rafah incursion, which led to the crossing's closure and intensified bombardment, causing more civilian casualties and displacement.\nIn the West Bank, the conflict's onset on October 7 has worsened economic conditions, with the suspension of work permits for jobs in Israel and heightened movement restrictions, leading to a significant income loss for many families. Movement restrictions have increased, with 793 obstacles, a 23% rise since June 2023. The Palestinian Authority struggles with paying public employees due to reduced clearance revenue and declining foreign aid, while the humanitarian situation has deteriorated. OCHA reports a 49% increase in demolitions and a 94% rise in displacement compared to 2023.",

I express my solidarity with all the victims and their loved ones.\nSince 7 October, a wave of shocking violence and bloodshed has erupted. The war that has followed the terrible attacks of one year ago continues to shatter lives and inflict profound human suffering for Palestinians in Gaza, and now the people of Lebanon. I have spoken out about this often and clearly.\nIt is time for the release of the hostages. Time to silence the guns. Time to stop the suffering that has engulfed the region. Time for peace, international law and justice. The United Nations is fully committed to achieving those goals. In the midst of so much bloodshed and division, we must hold on to hope.\nLet us honour the memory of the victims, reunite families and end the suffering and violence in the whole Middle East.

I am afraid to stay, and I am also afraid to leave,\" she quoted Haydar, an MSF driver, as saying.\nAt least 15 of the fatalities in Jabalia since dawn were due to Israeli strikes targeting various areas, including a school sheltering displaced individuals, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa said, citing medical sources.\nGaza's Civil Defence said dozens were wounded by Israeli quadcopter fire at the same school.\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has previously said that Gaza\u2019s militants use such shelters for cover. Hamas denied this.\nThe Israeli military has sent troops into the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya as well as Jabalia. Hamas has said it will keep fighting Israeli forces.\nPalestinian health officials have reported at least 130 deaths in the operation so far, while the military has told residents to evacuate areas where the UN estimates over 400,000 people are trapped.\nUnited Nations officials expressed concern that the ongoing Israeli offensive and evacuation orders in northern Gaza could disrupt the second phase of its polio vaccination campaign set to begin next week.\nHealthcare officials have reported that dozens of facilities in Gaza are under evacuation orders from the Israeli military, complicating humanitarian efforts amid the ongoing conflict.\nAid groups carried out an initial round of vaccinations last month after a baby was partially paralysed by the type 2 polio virus in August, in the first such case in the territory in 25 years.

It was a barbaric attack on civilians that shocked the world, but no one could have anticipated the relentless bombardment that would follow over the next year.\nIn the past 12 months, the Israeli military has killed over 41,700 people in Gaza, including more than 16,000 children. Thousands more lie beneath the rubble of Gaza\u2019s apocalyptic cityscapes. The most densely populated areas of the besieged strip of land have been almost entirely razed to the ground. Israel\u2019s fierce military assaults have caused over 70% of the Gaza Strip\u2019s buildings to be destroyed or severely damaged, forcing over two million Palestinians (out of roughly 2.3 million) to evacuate.\nResponding to immense humanitarian need\nAlmost everyone in Gaza has been displaced at least once and almost 100% of the population now live in poverty. Half a million people are in the most critical phase of food insecurity. Responding to the immense needs has been complicated not only by the conflict but by blocked access: 90% of aid movement between northern and southern Gaza has been denied over the past year.\nAt the same time, the Palestinian population of the West Bank has suffered a surge in violence from settler communities. Over 700 people have been killed, not only in settler attacks but in bombardment from the Israeli military.\nAs the military campaign against Palestinians has expanded towards the West Bank, so too has Israel\u2019s campaign against Lebanon, where a new theatre of all-out war has opened in the last month. In just a matter of weeks, over 2,000 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes, often in some of the most densely populated urban areas of the country. The strikes on Lebanon have provoked reaction from Iran, bringing the entire region to the precipice of a far larger international conflict. Urgent de-escalation is needed right now.\nTr\u00f3caire\u2019s CEO Caoimhe de Barra, said: \u201cOn the anniversary of the appalling attacks by Hamas on Israel, Tr\u00f3caire condemns the ongoing devastating war on Gaza and Lebanon and the continued detention of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Israels attacks on Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon have created a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions.\nTwo million people in Gaza are locked inside a living hell, one million people in Lebanon have been displaced. The Irish government and all members of the European Union need to exert maximum pressure on Israel and all parties to the conflict to come to the table and agree a ceasefire.\u201d",

She also expressed serious concern over the deteriorating access to healthcare and treatment services in the region, stating that the ongoing violence has compounded the psychological toll on the population.\n\u201cThe amount of anxiety and the exposure to trauma, as well as the level of anticipation of violence, is very abnormal,\u201d she said.\nShe also highlighted that 50 per cent of Gazans were already suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) before the relentless violence they have been experiencing since 7 October 2023.\n\u201cWe have to talk about it as a deliberate infliction of mental trauma,\u201d she added. \u201cThe psychological impacts, manifesting as anxiety, nightmares, depression, and memory loss, are compounded by the absence of adequate mental health resources.\u201d\n\u201cThere is an entire generation of children in Gaza who died or barely survived even before they received their birth certificates.\u201d Those who survive, she noted, suffer from enduring mental health challenges from constant violence, fear and loss, which she said will hinder their ability to function as adults.\n\u201cWe have already failed the generation of Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat future are we talking about, what generation are we talking about if we can\u2019t even stop the bombs right now today?\u201d\nShe criticised the UN for conducting discussions in New York during the Summit for the Future while failing to halt the ongoing bombardment in \u201cthe world\u2019s largest open-air prison\u201d, which is facing a genocide. The special rapporteur highlighted the destruction of homes and healthcare facilities, along with restricted access to essential services, as part of a strategy aimed at keeping Gaza\u2019s population in a state of constant fear and uncertainty, further worsening the mental health crisis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s psychological terror, and it\u2019s part of their genocidal plan,\u201d Mofokeng stated. Emphasising the urgency for immediate action, she called for a ceasefire to enable any form of recovery. Without a ceasefire and the necessary reconstruction efforts, she warned that the path to restoring health services remains uncertain.\nIsrael has killed more than 41,900 Palestinians in Gaza since 7 October last year and displaced 90 per cent of the enclave\u2019s population. The apartheid state faces accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for its actions in Gaza.\nREAD: US provided Israel with nearly $18bn in arms since Gaza offensive began",

At least 42,000 Palestinians have been killed, over two million people have already been displaced \u2013 many of them multiple times \u2013 and civilian infrastructure, including schools, mosques, churches, hospitals and universities, has been destroyed. \u201cThe repeated failure of Britain and other western governments to apply meaningful pressure including sanctions to secure a ceasefire has allowed Israel to escalate its criminal actions,\u201d said the coalition.\n\u201cThe situation in Gaza is intolerable and requires immediate, decisive action to prevent further loss of life and alleviate the suffering of its people. The British government must listen to the hundreds of thousands who have repeatedly taken to the streets to call for an end to Israel\u2019s attacks on the Palestinian people. It must condemn these latest acts by Israel, immediately halt the sale of weapons being used in this ethnic cleansing, and sanction those responsible.\u201d\nREAD: Al Jazeera condemns Israel\u2019s continued targeting of the network\u2019s journalists",

Several family members were killed, but Hind managed to phone the Palestinian Red Crescent for help. The ambulance trying to reach her was also shelled, and Hind, her family, and the ambulance crew all died.\nThe commission says the attacks on the healthcare system have \u201cinflicted conditions of life resulting in the destruction of generations of Palestinian children and, potentially, the Palestinian people as a group\u201d.\nThe report alleges Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, have subjected Israeli hostages to \"physical violence, abuse, sexual violence, forced isolation, limited access to hygiene facilities, water and food, threats and humiliation\".\nIt calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining hostages.\nThe report also expresses concern about the treatment of thousands of Palestinian detainees, some of them children.\nIsraeli security forces have subjected them to systematic abuse, including torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, the reports alleges.\nIt directly names Israel\u2019s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, saying the abuse took place \u201cunder direct orders\u201d from him.\nThe report contains detailed evidence and adds to growing concerns, reflected in a case at the International Court of Justice and investigations by the International Criminal Court, at the conduct of the widening war in the Middle East.\nThe war began after Hamas\u2019s unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 42,060 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

The ministry added that 97,590 others have been injured.\nAt least 30 people, including six children and two women, were killed near the central city of Deir el-Balah overnight, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital reported, after houses in the Bureij refugee camp were struck.\nMedical sources told Al Jazeera that Israel\u2019s military had killed 43 Palestinians across the enclave on Tuesday. The figure included seven people killed during an attack on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.\nThe Israeli army has placed Jabalia under siege for the last several days, in tandem with stepping up its attacks on northern Gaza to a level not seen in months, according to our team on the ground.\nThe Israeli army reported that it had killed at least 20 armed Palestinian fighters in northern Gaza.

One man was bleeding from the abdomen as people tried to help him walk. Another, a little girl, is shown bleeding from the neck as she is bandaged in the back of an ambulance.\nAlthough Israel has put a significant focus on attacking Hezbollah in Lebanon, its military is maintaining its efforts to fulfil the demands of its political masters to wipe out Hamas \u2013 a task that most analysts suggest is unrealistic.\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Abu Azzoum reported that the Israeli army is \u201csystematically working to empty northern Gaza\u201d.",

Special Representative Patten stated: \u201cToday we stand united in remembrance of those who lost their lives and in unwavering support of the survivors who bear the scars of that fateful day, in particular the victims of sexual violence, a heinous crime that has devastating physical and psychological impacts.\u201d\nShe also recalled the conclusions of her mission to Israel earlier this year, that conflict-related sexual violence including rape and gang rape, was committed during the 7 October attacks in multiple locations across the Gaza periphery; and subsequently against hostages during their captivity. She also recalled having reasonable grounds to believe that such violence against hostages may still be ongoing. Special Representative Patten expresses her continued concerns about the plight of hostages still in captivity in Gaza and reiterates her call for their immediate, safe and unconditional release. \u201cIn these challenging times, I recognize the courage and resilience of those who have been released but remain gravely concerned for the hostages still held in captivity.

It is of vital importance to ensure fully-fledged independent investigations into all allegations of sexual violence during or in the aftermath of the 7 October attacks.

They arrive with few means and in need of urgent relief,\u201d UNHCR chief Mr. Grandi said, visiting the Jdeidet Yabous border crossing.\nThe exodus comes as the conflict between Israel and Lebanon escalates, forcing Lebanese refugees to seek safety across the border.\nThe arrival of refugees in Syria adds another layer of complexity to an already strained humanitarian situation. The Syrian civil war which began in 2011 has resulted in one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.\nThe country continues to face significant challenges which the UN human rights office, OHCHR, warns is falling deeper into a humanitarian crisis that threatens to spiral out of control.\nOnly a quarter of this year\u2019s humanitarian needs in Syria have been funded, while needs are at their highest since the start of the conflict: 13 million Syrians face acute food insecurity and over 650,000 children show signs of stunting from severe malnutrition.\nDangerous journey amid destruction\nWith the main road between Lebanese and Syrian border posts destroyed by an airstrike, refugees are forced to make the journey on foot, with their children and whatever belongings they can carry.\nUNHCR \u2013 in collaboration with the Syrian Red Crescent, other UN agencies, including the World Food Programme (WFP), and NGOs \u2013 are providing immediate assistance at the border, including water, food items, and blankets.

This violence occurs in the context of Israel\u2019s decades-long unlawful occupation and annexation of Palestinian territory.\nThe crimes committed by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on 7th October 2023, which resulted in the death of nearly 1,200 people, many of them of young age, including at least 33 children, and the taking of 251 hostages, have been widely condemned. In retaliation, Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza have officially killed more than 40,000 people, including over 14,000 children, while almost 100,000 people have suffered life-altering injuries and potentially irreversible mental harm. Additionally, an estimated 20,000 Gazan children remain missing.\nMeanwhile, in the West Bank, the use of unnecessary and disproportionate force by the Israeli Defense Forces, along with increasing settler violence, house demolitions, forced displacement, has resulted in the death of nearly 700 Palestinians, including at least 143 children, and the displacement of thousands more.\nIsrael\u2019s conduct of hostilities and practices of humanitarian access have made it nearly impossible for humanitarian, human rights, and development aid organizations to fulfill their mandates. The shrinking humanitarian space in Gaza is not conducive to providing robust and meaningful humanitarian aid to people in need.\nFor decades, members of Terre des Hommes International Federation have provided life-saving humanitarian support in the West Bank and Gaza.\nOver the past year, we have witnessed firsthand the immense pain and suffering experienced by children, their families, and the entire communities in the region, yet their resilience in the face of overwhelming challenges continues to inspire our work.\nThe long-term impact of this extreme violence on children, youth, and future generations is impossible to predict with certainty.\nWe are deeply concerned about the future, as this situation calls into question how these communities will be able to rebuild and coexist in a peaceful and sustainable way.\nMembers of Terre des Hommes International Federation reiterate their call for::\nImmediate ceasefire in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Lebanon and dedicated diplomatic efforts for de-escalation in the region.\nThe immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and individuals arbitrarily detained.\nUnimpeded access for humanitarian actors must be regular and safe.\nAll civilians should be protected by the international law and the Rights for children should be always respected.\nAll States must take all measure to respect and to ensure respect for the international law, including the IHL, in all circumstances.",

        "content": "title: A Year of Sorrow - Statement by Administrator Samantha Power \n content: Office of Press Relations\npress@usaid.gov\nMonday, October 7, 2024\nOne year ago today, Hamas orchestrated a brutal terrorist attack on Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, many of whom are still held by Hamas or unaccounted for to this day. Forever seared into our collective consciousness are the memories of young people at a concert running for their lives, seniors and young children huddling in terror in their homes, and the searing sounds of the victims\u2019 final words to their loved ones. We mourn all those that were murdered that day and grieve with all those who have suffered since.\nIn February, I visited Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, situated on the Gaza periphery, where nearly 100 people were murdered and nearly 30 taken hostage. I saw the horrors that were perpetrated when terrorists attacked a peaceful community and murdered and kidnapped innocent people en masse. I spoke with a father who, in the hours after the attack, attempted to get his children to safety \u2013 covering their eyes as they ran so they wouldn\u2019t have to see the carnage around them. He showed me the place where his kids\u2019 grandfather and grandmother were executed at point blank range. We must not forget the lives lost, the families broken, and those who have endured 365 excruciating days of waiting for word of their stolen loved ones.\nAnd in the year since, the human cost of the war that began due to the attacks on October 7 has been unimaginable. Across the region, innocent men, women, and children who wanted nothing more than to live in peace and safety have been killed. We mourn all those who have lost their lives in Israel, the West Bank, and Lebanon, and the tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza \u2013 including more than 11,000 children. When I spoke with Palestinians during a visit to the West Bank earlier this year, one man told me that a single Israeli airstrike killed 16 of his grandchildren. So many in Gaza are hungry, sick, and cold \u2013 displaced from their homes, and approaching winter with little to no shelter.\nAcross our own USAID community, staff have been deeply impacted by the carnage and trauma of October 7 and the past year of war and humanitarian crisis \u2013 including by the horrific deaths and serious injuries of family and friends in Israel, Gaza, and Lebanon. In Gaza, USAID-funded local implementing partner staff and volunteers have been among those who have been injured and killed during Israeli military operations.\nLooking back over the last year, nothing will bring back those who have died, and nothing can undo the agony people have been living through. Looking forward, all those involved in this conflict must do more to prevent further suffering. The U.S has been the single largest provider of aid to the Palestinian people since October 7, and we continue our relentless push for an enduring ceasefire that will bring home the hostages and end the war in Gaza, as well as our humanitarian efforts and support for diplomacy to provide much-needed relief to people across the region.",

MAG stands with all those affected by conflict \u2013 including our colleagues, friends and partners. We also mourn the loss of more than 1,000 humanitarian and medical workers who put themselves on the front line to help others and, in so doing, should have been protected.\nThe Universal Declaration on Human Rights reminds us that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. International humanitarian law binds warring parties to protect those not directly involved in conflict. When people are denied basic necessities like food, water and shelter, and when civilians are killed and injured daily, these basic rules are not being upheld.\nThe deaths of more than 1,200 people in the October 7th attack \u2013 the majority of whom were civilians \u2013 and the continued holding of more than 100 Israeli hostages in Gaza is an unspeakable tragedy. The retaliation, leading to an unprecedented number of women and children being killed in Gaza, has caused only further tragedy and loss, massively exacerbated by the repeated use of explosive weapons in such a densely populated area, usage which is, by its very nature, indiscriminate.\nThe past 12 months have seen an estimated 34,820** missile, drone and artillery strikes across the Middle East, using a wide range of ordnance \u2013 some of which will have failed to explode. We have previously reported that MAG is doing everything feasible to support communities in Gaza through our partnerships with local NGOs and the United Nations Mine Action Service, and in Lebanon through risk education, and that our long-established programme there is preparing for a longer term response to new contamination. Until our teams can safely access the affected areas, survey and clearance cannot begin, and the true scale of explosive ordnance contamination is unknown. For MAG to carry out its vital work supporting communities to recover from conflict and return to their homes, security is an essential prerequisite.\nThe situation in the region continues to escalate, but it is time for this devastation to end. The international community must strive for inclusive security and peace. States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty must fulfil their obligations to ensure arms transfers do not undermine international humanitarian law. Security Council Resolution 2735 must be fully implemented under a governance structure that facilitates humanitarian access, including for clearance of explosive ordnance. A ceasefire must also be reached in Lebanon with the utmost urgency.\nHuman rights must be defended and civilian lives must be protected, now and always.\n*Data of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n**Data of ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data)",

The military confirmed that hospitals were included in the evacuation orders but said it had not set a specific timetable.\nFares Abu Hamza, an official with the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service, said there are a \u201clarge number of martyrs\u201d still uncollected from the streets and under the rubble.\n\u201cWe are unable to reach them,\u201d he told The Associated Press, adding that street dogs are eating some of the remains.\nQuestions over 'The General's Plan'\nWith the large-scale siege in northern Gaza, Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there.\nThe offensive came weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly considered a plan to besiege northern Gaza, aiming to starve Hamas into releasing hostages by cutting off supplies.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began the operation after gathering intelligence that indicated \"terrorist presence\" and Hamas rebuilding efforts in Jabalya, a northern Gaza refugee camp. However, the current offensive is far more extensive, affecting areas beyond Jabalya.\nWhile four sources told CNN that the Israeli cabinet has not officially approved the siege proposal put forward by retired General Giora Eiland, the operation resembles his publicly shared plan.\nEiland presented his proposal both in a video and privately to the Israeli cabinet and the Knesset, Israel's parliament.\nA former senior military official, familiar with the government's security strategy but not directly involved in the decision-making, said the cabinet adopted \"a version\" of Eiland\u2019s plan, which is now referred to as \u201cThe General\u2019s Plan.\u201d\nEiland himself confirmed to CNN that this claim is \u201cquite true,\u201d but highlighted significant differences between his proposal and what is being implemented.\nHis original plan involved evacuating all civilians from northern Gaza, including Gaza City, and cutting off all supplies to the area to force a reset in the conflict and disrupt Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar\u2019s strategy.\nNo food since Oct 1\nThe United Nations food agency said that no food aid had entered northern Gaza since Oct. 1.\nThe World Food Program said that the primary border crossing into the war-ravaged area had been closed for about two weeks, warning that Israel\u2019s ongoing ground operation has a disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinians families there.\nConcerns of a hunger crisis have risen in Gaza roughly a month after the U.N.\u2019s independent investigator on the right to food accused Israel of carrying out a \u201cstarvation campaign\u201d against Palestinians.\nMeanwhile, major U.S. newspapers, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, reported that the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, had originally been planned for 2022 but was delayed as the group sought support from Iran and Hezbollah.",

We did what we could. Remember us.\u201d\nMy colleague, Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, wrote these words on October 20 in Gaza, on a whiteboard used to plan surgeries. He was a 38-year-old physician and father of three who had been working around the clock caring for injured patients, including many children orphaned by the war.\nHe was killed by a strike on his hospital a month later.\nI share this not to make you lose hope, but to bear witness\u2014to honor his story and the patients he cared for. MSF is more than a medical organization. We are an international movement founded by doctors and journalists.\nWe speak out against suffering that we witness firsthand\u2014and raise our voices for change. MSF calls on all parties to the conflict in Gaza to ensure the protection of civilians. We continue to call for an immediate and sustained ceasefire to save lives. We are so grateful to those of you who have raised your voices with us.\nThis has been a year of heartbreak. I know many of you feel the same. At MSF USA, many of us have friends, family, and loved ones in Palestine, Israel, or both. All of us have colleagues working in Palestine to deliver lifesaving care. Yet nowhere is safe in Gaza.\nMSF has worked in Gaza for 35 years, but the escalation of violence in the past year has been catastrophic. On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched horrific attacks within Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 251 people as hostages. In response, Israel launched a horrific military offensive on Gaza that has so far killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, 11,000 of them children. Among those killed in Gaza are six of our colleagues and many more family members.\nWe grieve every life lost and disrupted by this violence. Yet, even amid this horror, we do what we can to save each life in front of us.\nA year into this offensive, the Israeli military\u2019s unrelenting airstrikes have reduced much of the Gaza Strip to rubble. 1.9 million people have been forced from their homes\u2014often multiple times.\nWe grieve every life lost and disrupted by this violence. Yet, even amid this horror, we do what we can to save each life in front of us.\nAs my colleague Dr. Rasha Khoury, MSF USA\u2019s Board of Directors President, says of her emergency maternal health work around the globe: \u201cWhat keeps me going is the feeling that if this were my sister or my mother or my daughter, I would want somebody like me to be there holding their hand. I would never want them to be alone.\u201d\nThat is what it means to be a humanitarian. It is an expression of solidarity\u2014the belief that every human life has value, that we are all connected, and that we must help each other as humans. It is also about hope and resilience.\nWhat brings me hope: Despite it all, over 700 MSF staff are working in Gaza right now, caring for patients in their time of need. We are still there, performing surgeries, caring for mothers and their newborns, providing mental health support, and vaccinating children against polio. We have also opened two field hospitals to respond to growing needs.\nLearn more about our work in Gaza and what your support makes possible.\nOne year on, we remember, mourn, and reflect. We also recommit to acting with empathy and compassion, with you by our side.",

        "content": "title: British Muslims deserve safety and belonging. War in Gaza has made us fear we\u2019ll lose both \n content: The reverberations of the Israel-Gaza conflict have been felt acutely by British Muslims in the year since the attacks of 7 October. As I travel across our communities, I\u2019ve witnessed first-hand how the conflict has challenged once again our sense of security and our place within British society.\nThe human cost is staggering. I\u2019ve spoken with British Palestinians who have lost dozens of family members in Gaza. Parents call me, distraught after their children have been arrested for their pro-Palestinian advocacy. University students fear deportation for criticising Israel.\nThe calls for peace and justice for Palestinians echo far beyond the Muslim community. People of all faiths and none have taken to the streets in diverse, impassioned marches. With each passing day, as the civilian death toll in Gaza and beyond mounts, the case against Israel for having committed war crimes grows stronger. This is not a Muslim issue; it\u2019s a human rights issue that concerns us all.\nYet British Muslims find themselves caught up in this, thrown into \u201cculture wars\u201d not of their choosing. While we stand in solidarity with those facing mortal suffering, we are confronted by an alarming surge in Islamophobia. The conflict has been cynically manipulated to stoke hatred against Muslims, orchestrated not only by far-right elements, but also by those who deploy harmful tropes to silence peaceful advocacy for Palestine.\nThe racist riots we witnessed in England in the summer were, in part, a reflection of this \u2013 fuelled by false narratives of \u201ctwo-tier policing\u201d. Just this summer, we saw leading politicians make calls to ban the sacred Muslim affirmation \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is great) and declare that \u201cNot all cultures are equally valid\u201d when talking of recent immigrants who apparently \u201chate\u201d Israel. Muslim politicians face accusations of being controlled by Islamists or pursuing \u201csectarian\u201d agendas.\nIn workplaces across the country, Muslims struggle to process the horrors they are witnessing while navigating difficult conversations with colleagues. Even longstanding inter-faith relationships have been strained. While many Jewish and Muslim colleagues have reached out to support one another, the polarisation has taken its toll. There has been a concerted effort to frame this as a Muslim-Jewish issue, disregarding the millions of others who oppose the violence on humanitarian grounds.\nCommunities have turned to us for guidance on how to help, how to challenge harmful narratives, and how to maintain hope as the violence continues. Mosques, seeking to provide spiritual solace, have faced vandalism and attacks. Schools grapple with students wearing Palestinian badges, leaving many young people confused and conflicted.\nThe physical manifestations of hate are impossible to ignore.I myself experienced a hate crime on the London Underground, where someone shouted at me: \u201cYou lot are all taking over.\u201d\nYet despite these challenges, there is hope. We can build common bonds that would bypass the urge to \u201cchoose sides\u201d, while adhering to our deeply held view that the unfolding genocide in Palestine must stop.\n-\nZara Mohammed is secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He noted that armed drones and ground vehicles from the Israeli military are targeting anything that moves within these zones.\nThe Israeli army has reportedly damaged or destroyed most of the roads leading south from northern Gaza, rendering them \u201calmost impossible\u201d for passage. Since launching its ground offensive on Oct. 6, northern Gaza has endured over 100 aggressive strikes, with 50 occurring on the first day of the operation. According to Basal, more than 120 Palestinians have been killed in these assaults, and the death toll is expected to rise as many bodies remain uncollected on the roads due to ongoing hostilities.\nHumanitarian crisis deepens\nThe spokesperson cautioned that Israeli demands for hospitals to evacuate could result in the collapse of the healthcare system and exacerbate the suffering of residents. He highlighted that Israel is obstructing the entry of essential supplies into northern Gaza, warning that the population is running dangerously low on food and water. Basal characterized the humanitarian situation in the region as \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d with a pervasive risk of death due to the lack of basic necessities.\nRead: Palestinian cameraman killed, reporter injured in Israel attacks on Jabalia\nChallenges for civil defense teams\nBasal explained that civil defense teams are encountering significant difficulties due to shortages of fuel, equipment, and machinery, which could completely halt their already limited services. Nevertheless, he affirmed that the teams would persist in their efforts until the very end. He said the pressure on civil defense teams engaged in search and rescue and firefighting efforts has intensified due to the Israeli military\u2019s actions.\nWithout immediate assistance in the form of essential supplies, there is a grave risk that civil defense services in northern Gaza could cease entirely. Basal called for an end to the genocide in Gaza, urging support for medical and civil defense teams and emphasizing the critical need for humanitarian aid to alleviate the dire conditions faced by residents.\nAttacks escalate\nFor five consecutive days, the Israeli army has continued ground operations targeting the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, attempting to force residents to flee. On 7 October, Israeli Army spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned residents of Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahia through social media, with a map showing evacuation areas.\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry reported that the Israeli army ordered the evacuation of Kamala Adwan, Indonesian, and Al-Awda hospitals in northern Gaza, threatening severe repercussions if these facilities are not vacated, similar to its actions at Shifa Hospital.\nSince 7 October, more than 42,100 Palestinians, including 17,000 children and 11,378 women, have reportedly died, with 97,720 others injured in Israel\u2019s bombardments of the Gaza Strip. Reports indicate that thousands may still be trapped beneath the rubble, while civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, has been targeted and destroyed as people sought shelter.",

Hamas has denied it uses the locations as command centres.\nThe UN inquiry\u2019s statement also accused Israeli forces of deliberately killing and torturing medical personnel, targeting medical vehicles and restricting patients from leaving Gaza.\nThe Commission of Inquiry has a broad mandate to collect evidence and identify suspected perpetrators of international crimes committed in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. It bases its findings on a range of sources including interviews with victims and witnesses, submissions and satellite imagery.\nThe COI has previously alleged that both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes in the early stages of the Gaza war, and that Israel\u2019s actions also constituted crimes against humanity because of the immense civilian losses.

The Israeli military has sent troops into the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya as well as Jabalia and ordered residents to evacuate their homes and head to safe areas south of the enclave.\nPalestinian and United Nations officials say there are no safe areas in Gaza.

        "content": "title: Law for Palestine in collaboration with Visualizing Palestine Launches a new Data Portal for Tracking Genocidal Incitement Against Palestinians \n content: 10 October, 2024 \u2013 For the last year, since October 7th, Law for Palestine has been documenting genocidal incitement against the Palestinian people by Israeli government officials, military personnel, and public figures. On January 4, 2024, portions of this data was published publicly for the first time. Today, Law for Palestine, in collaboration with Visualizing Palestine, is launching a new data portal designed to make these statements more accessible to researchers, legal scholars, and advocates.\nTo date, the database has compiled instances of genocidal rhetoric\u2014including explicit calls for forced displacement and collective punishment\u2014which capture the systemic and intrinsic nature of these threats. Notably, these statements are tied to Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign.\nSince October 7th 2023, the Israeli government\u2019s indiscriminate military campaign against the Palestinian people in Gaza has unleashed unprecedented death, devastation, mass starvation, as well as mass displacement, a continuum of the over 76 year long Nakba. Creating one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history, Israel\u2019s bombardment of residential buildings, refugee camps, hospitals, schools, universities, and civilian infrastructure necessary for sustaining life in Gaza has been relentless. This, combined with the Israeli blockade on essential humanitarian aid has paralyzed relief efforts, leaving international agencies powerless to provide humanitarian relief and prevent further suffering. Even though these assaults are most visible in Gaza, the violence inflicted by Israel on the Palestinian people extends across the Palestinian territory it occupies unlawfully, into illegally annexed East Jerusalem, and the West Bank, as well as towards Palestinian citizens of Israel.\nIn the West Bank including East Jerusalem, Palestinians face unprecedented and relentless violence and displacement at the hands of illegal Israeli settlers, supported by state-backed policies. Settlers, often with the active participation of Israeli soldiers, attack communities, setting homes, schools, and places of worship on fire, forcing children and their families to flee. People are left traumatized, witnessing the destruction of their homes and the killing of loved ones, while paramedics are deliberately blocked from reaching the wounded, leaving many to die without medical care.\nA Tool for Accountability and Justice Genocidal incitement against Palestinians\nThe database on genocidal intent is a crucial resource for the international community, legal experts, human rights organizations, and policymakers. It provides an extensive, well-organized repository of evidence documenting how incitement to genocide has directly fueled Israel\u2019s military and political strategies. The database systematically catalogs evidence of genocidal intent, including:\n- Civilian Harm\n- Genocidal Intent\n- Forced Displacement\n- Collective Punishment\n- Dehumanization\n- Destruction of Infrastructure\n- Starvation\n- Torture\nEach of these themes represents clear violations of international law, including the Genocide Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. By cataloging and categorising these crimes, this database supports global efforts to hold Israeli officials accountable and builds a strong foundation for legal action in international and national courts. The information compiled here can play a pivotal role in securing justice for Palestinians, ensuring that these crimes do not go unseen or unpunished.",

Experts have estimated that, between October 2023 and April 2024, approximately 70,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Gaza, surpassing the bombing of Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during World War II (to date the toll reaches 85,000 tons). The indiscriminate bombings, relentless airstrikes, and shelling have killed at least 41,965 Palestinian civilians and maimed at least 97,590 civilians (OCHA oPt/MoH October 2024). It is estimated that 70% of casualties are women and children. The systematic destruction of civilian infrastructures (including hospitals, schools, and homes) has brought the healthcare and education system to its knees, making the access to clean water and education nearly impossible. Starvation has been used as a method of warfare (as declared also by the EUs Foreign Policy Chief), with Israel restricting the entry of food, fuel, and medicine as well as humanitarian operators. The repeated unlawful forced displacement of millions of Palestinians has erased any sense of safety or dignity, with the so called \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d been squeezed to just 11% of the enclave\u2019s territory and persistently bombed. These atrocities, in clear violation of international law, are committed after a 17-years-long blockade on Gaza and decades-long unlawful occupation. As denounced by the Association of International Development Agencies: \"[The war on Gaza] reflects the failure of the international order-particularly powerful nations whose inaction and enabling of Israel\u2019s actions have compounded Palestinian suffering and shattered international norms.\u201d\nONE YEAR OF HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE: WeWorld on the frontline for lifesaving interventions\nThanks to its decades-long presence in the Gaza Strip (since 1997), and despite the relentless attacks, the displacement of the staff and the severe operational restrictions imposed by Israel, WeWorld was able to immediately activate an integrated humanitarian response to address the critical needs of the population in the Governorate of Rafah, Khan Younis, Middle Area (Deir el-Balah) and Gaza City. The team on the ground, impacted by the conflict like the rest of population, was mobilized to deliver comprehensive WASH services \u2013 including provision of water, hygiene promotion, and Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) measures and the provision of sanitation facilities; Food Security responses \u2013 through the distribution of Food Parcels - and distribution of essential Non-Food Items (hygiene kits, blankets and cooking gas and constructing material for tents).\nTo improve the efficiency, reach and accountability of the humanitarian response, WeWorld has adopted a localized approach, through the establishment of 15 community-based Local Hygiene Committees, composed of community members with expertise in public health (nurses, doctors, community health workers). These committees have been instrumental in delivering inclusive and culturally appropriate humanitarian responses in camps and shelters for internally displaced persons (IDPs) including supporting on the delivery of WASH basic services and on the distribution of NFI.\nOver the course of 12 months, WeWorld has provided critical humanitarian assistance to a total of 639,698 people, including 383,819 children (198,306 girls and 185,512 boys, which represents 60% of the total target).",

While up to 51,000 children in the besieged enclave could be unaccompanied or separated from their parents, the International Rescue Committee has warned. The stark figure is another result of frequent \u201cevacuation orders, detentions and attacks\u201d which have contributed to more families being separated, the charity said.\nMr Lazzarini also said some UNRWA shelters and services were being forced to shut down for the first time since the war began and that with almost no basic supplies available, hunger was spreading again in northern Gaza. Israel did not immediately comment on Mr Lazzarini\u2019s remarks, but Israeli authorities have previously said they facilitate food deliveries to Gaza despite challenging conditions.\nThis is the third instance in the last year where Israeli forces have reentered Jabalia and its refugee camp, with the last operation in May displacing tens of thousands of people.\nIsrael launched its military campaign in Gaza in response to a bloody attack inside Israel on 7 October by Hamas, during which around 1,200 people were killed and another 250 taken hostage. Israel\u2019s retaliatory war against Hamas has displaced 1.9 million of Gaza\u2019s 2.3m population, often multiple times and Israeli bombardment, in addition to the 42,000 deaths. Air and ground operations have caused vast destruction.\nGaza\u2019s health ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabalia over three days starting Sunday and another 14 from communities farther north. Medics say further casualties have been reported but because of repeated incoming fire, they are unable to reach the bodies.\nAn airstrike in Jabalia early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies. Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah.",

The densely populated area has been encircled and besieged for a week, with no food or water coming in.\nAt least 220 people have been killed since the start of the operation, according to the civil defence in Jabalia.\nConceived by retired Major-General Giora Eiland, \"the general's plan\", which was launched in an Israeli TV campaign in September, called for the ethnic cleansing of northern Gaza, warning that those that remained would face starvation.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nAccording to a report published on Friday in the Israeli daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, the Israeli military was now implementing a \"scaled-down\" version of the plan in the Jabalia refugee camp, northern Gaza.\nIsraeli air raids continued to pound the area on Saturday and on Friday the army struck four houses in the camp, killing 22 people and wounding dozens, medics said.\nIn addition to Jabalia, Israeli forces were deployed into the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, ordering residents to leave their homes and head south.\nEarlier this week, residents of the Jabalia camp told Middle East Eye that they weren\u2019t given any prior warning before the start of the incursion, whereas on previous occasions, they had been given 24 hours to leave.\n\u201cThe soldiers suddenly entered from all areas and closed off all the exits from Jabalia,\u201d Abed Ali, a camp resident, said.\nEven as the Israeli army has ordered people to leave Jabalia, the ferocity of the air and ground attacks have made it impossible for most residents to flee safely, with quadcopters constantly flying overhead.\n'The soldiers suddenly entered from all areas and closed off all the exits from Jabalia'\n- Abed Ali, camp resident\nResidents said there were no safe areas in Gaza to flee to and many have said they preferred to stay.\nPeople in Jabalia are also reporting that food and water supplies are dwindling fast. The United Nations has meanwhile expressed concern over severe shortages of food, fuel and medical supplies in northern Gaza, and said there was a risk of famine there.\nThe Palestinian health ministry said Israel's threats to evacuate three hospitals operating in northern Gaza by force put the safety of patients and medical staff at risk.\nMedical staff at the besieged Kamal Adwan hospital have described the situation as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d, with the lives of children in its overcrowded intensive care unit at risk amid dwindling fuel and medical supplies.\nAt least 19 Palestinians were killed on Saturday in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, including in the southern city of Khan Younis and in Gaza City in the north.\nMiddle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

        "content": "title: \u2018War has no place in the lives of children\u2019 \n content: By Dereje Wordofa, President of SOS Children\u2019s Villages International\nOne year has passed since the heartbreaking attack on Israel and the escalation of the Gaza War. We are reminded of the devastating toll this violent conflict has taken along with the continued tragedy of loss of life and limb. On behalf SOS Children\u2019s Villages International, I urgently call for a ceasefire, for civilians to be protected - particularly children who must be safeguarded - and for all hostages held in Gaza to be returned safely to their families.\nThe consequences of the war and its aftermath on children is immense. In the attack on Oct. 7 and the war that followed, thousands have lost parents, family members, and the very foundation of their safety. According to the UN, at least 17,000 children in Gaza are unaccompanied or separated from their parents, a staggering 1% of the displaced population of 1.7 million. Similarly, reports from the International Rescue Committee reveal the grim reality: between 15,000 and 19,000 children have had their parents killed and have no adult to care for them, and more than 10,000 Palestinians\u2014mostly women and children\u2014are missing. The expansion of hostilities is creating an even greater catastrophe in the region, with the attacks in Lebanon killing and injuring children at an alarming rate.\nThese disturbing numbers reflect a humanitarian crisis of unimaginable scale. Unfortunately, the sufferings are often reduced to statistics i.e., counting deaths, injuries, and displacements. However, behind these numbers lies the untold suffering of every child, woman, man, and elderly, whose individual stories of pain and loss are difficult to fully capture. What\u2019s often overlooked is the deep, long-term trauma to children on both sides of any given conflict that spans generations, silently shaping lives long after the immediate violence ends.\nThis profound anguish among Israeli, Palestinian and Lebanese children goes beyond figures, leaving scars that may never heal. It is essential that we not only address the immediate crisis but also recognize and respond to the enduring emotional and psychological wounds left in its wake. Children\u2019s mental health is at risk, and their voices must be heard if we are to help them build emotional resilience.\nGlobally, the effects of armed conflict on children are catastrophic, and Gaza is no exception. In war-torn areas, children's lives are shattered as they face relentless violations of their rights. Residential areas have been mercilessly bombarded, tearing families apart and leaving children in constant danger. Children who lose parental care amid conflict and war are among the most vulnerable, facing greater risks of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect.\nThe rights of children, as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, are being grossly violated. These include the right to life, survival, development, education, protection from violence and abuse, and access to essential healthcare and nutrition. We call on all parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights, especially those protecting children.\nTo save the lives of children caught in warzones, we must ensure safe humanitarian access, including food, water, shelter, medical care, trauma treatment, and psychosocial support. There is only one durable solution: the international community must take decisive action, intensifying diplomatic efforts to bring an end to this conflict and current escalations in the region. War has no place in the lives of children, anywhere. An immediate ceasefire is imperative. The time to act is now.",

He described the current situation as a genocide against Muslims, particularly in Gaza, and called for a collective response from Islamic nations to prevent further atrocities.\nNawaz Sharif condemned the violence against unarmed Palestinians, labelling it a historical atrocity. He painted a stark picture of the devastation, stating, \"Entire cities have been reduced to rubble, and families have been torn apart, with children taken from their mothers and killed before their eyes.\" Nawaz expressed frustration over the inaction of the United Nations, emphasising that its resolutions regarding Palestinian rights remain unimplemented, leaving Palestinians vulnerable and without recourse.\nDrawing parallels between the Palestinian issue and the long-standing Kashmir conflict, Nawaz lamented the UN's failure to act decisively in both cases. \"What is the point of a UN that cannot enforce its own resolutions? It is a disgrace,\" he said, calling for a robust strategy that prioritises justice and humanitarian aid for Palestinians.\nNawaz urged Islamic nations to unite and take decisive action, asserting that the time for passive observation has passed. \"We must mobilise our resources and create effective policies,\" he said, stressing that now is the time to act before further bloodshed occurs. He noted, \"Israel feels emboldened by the support of global powers, and they must consider how long they can test the patience of the Islamic world.\"\nThe conference is set to conclude with a series of resolutions aimed at increasing international pressure on Israel and coordinating a unified response among Islamic nations.\nLeaders expressed their determination to continue advocating for the rights of Palestinians and to hold Israel accountable for its actions.\nFlouting a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire, Israel has continued a relentless offensive on Gaza following an attack by Hamas last October.\nMore than 41,800 victims have been killed, most of them women and children, in the year since, and nearly 97,000 others injured, according to local health authorities.\nThe Israeli onslaught has displaced almost the entire population of the territory amid an ongoing blockade that has led to severe shortages of food, clean water and medicine.\nIsrael also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its actions in Gaza.",

        "content": "title: Decentralizing testing for rapid mpox detection in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n content: Kinshasa \u2013 To ensure adequate and prompt detection of mpox cases, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is decentralizing laboratory services and accelerating efforts to curb the disease through close coordination with support from partners, including World Health Organization (WHO), who are providing critical diagnostic equipment and supplies to bolster the outbreak response.\nIn August 2024, eight additional laboratories were set up to test mpox samples in five provinces, targeting eight localities (Mbandaka, Ingende, Goma, Bukavu, Kamituga, Kisangani, Boende and Kinshasa).\n\u201cStrengthening diagnosis makes it possible to monitor transmission and geographical spread, as well as to track the evolution of disease transmission,\u201d says Dr Olga Ntumba, laboratory focal point with WHO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nDelayed diagnosis has ripple effects on other key outbreak response measures including case confirmation, clinical care, follow-up and monitoring of contacts, as well as providing critical information to the health authorities at the national level for strategic decision-making.\nWith funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), WHO delivered 3500 GeneXpert cartridges in September 2024 to support mpox diagnosis in the decentralized laboratories. The Organization also supplied 14 000 dry swabs and viral transport media to ensure quality sampling in all provinces. A further shipment of 12 000 GeneXpert cartridges is planned.\nThe ongoing efforts are helping to scale up laboratory testing. For example, the number of samples analysed rose from around 9700 on 8 September 2024 to over 11 400 on 17 September 2024. Reliable diagnosis is also helping to ensure rapid confirmation of cases, monitoring of the outbreak trend, as well as determining the areas of greatest infection burden to mobilize human and material resources for stronger response.\n\u201cThe benefits of decentralized laboratories are improved access to diagnostics, reduced sample processing times and increased capacity for rapid response to outbreaks such as the current mpox outbreak,\u201d says Dr Nicole Kumbolani Afuwa, Head of the Equateur Provincial Health Division.\nFor Brigitte Elema Tondoko, the supervisor of the mpox treatment centre at Wangata General Referral Hospital in Mbandaka province, swift and effective testing is crucial in halting the mpox outbreak.\n\u201cWith the support of WHO, we have gradually improved our capacity to diagnose and detect mpox in the community,\u201d says Tondoko. \u201cWe rely on the work of emergency teams to monitor cases, and we use the medicines and medical supplies we receive to treat the sick and protect frontline health workers. All this enables us to take better care of mpox patients, and we remain hopeful of containing this disease in the very near future.\u201d\nThe spread of the mpox virus in Democratic Republic of the Congo is attributed to two distinct outbreaks: spread of mpox clade Ia in Equateur and other provinces of the country where mpox is endemic, and of clade Ib in North and South Kivu province, with a few cases in the capital Kinshasa.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo accounts for 90% of all mpox cases recorded in the African region, with over 30 000 suspected cases and 988 deaths reported as of 26 September 2024. WHO is supporting the country in implementing the national preparedness and response plan, including strengthening surveillance and diagnostic capacities, contact tracing, providing essential drugs for management, supplying equipment for infection prevention and control, vaccine rollout, risk communication and community engagement, and combating misinformation.\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\nCollins Boakye-Agyemang\nCommunications and marketing officer\nTel: + 242 06 520 65 65 (WhatsApp)\nEmail: boakyeagyemangc@who.int\nMarl\u00e8ne Dimegni Bermi\nCharg\u00e9e de communication\nT\u00e9l : +243 899 330 358\nEmail: dimegnim@who.int",

        "content": "title: Increased Protection of Human Rights in The Occupied Palestinian Territory \n content: 26 September 2024\nCritical Action Is Needed Now\nThe humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached unprecedented levels with catastrophic consequences for civilians. Since 7 October 2023, the hostilities have caused extensive loss of life, widespread destruction of homes, and severe damage to vital infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and utilities. Civilians, especially women, children, and older persons, as well as persons with disabilities and persons with illnesses are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the violence, with many losing their homes, loved ones, and access to basic services.\nThe war has compounded an already dire situation in Gaza, where years of blockade and recurring cycles of conflict have severely constrained access to food, medical supplies, and essential services.\nHospitals are destroyed, and healthcare facilities are struggling to provide critical care to the thousands of injured. The destruction of power and water systems has left large parts of the population without access to clean water and sanitation, increasing the risk of spread of disease.\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Gaza, and repeated \u201cevacuation orders\u201d lead to displacement at an alarming rate, with hundreds of thousands of civilians forced to flee their homes. Many are seeking refuge in overcrowded \u201cshelters\u201d, which themselves have been subject to attacks. The lack of safe corridors and the ongoing violence have hindered humanitarian efforts to deliver life-saving aid, leaving people in desperate need of food, water, and medical assistance.\nIn addition, thousands of Palestinians have been arbitrarily detained, often held in secret, incommunicado detention, with consistent reports of ill-treatment and torture at the hands of Israeli security forces.\nIsrael\u2019s restrictions on the entry of food, water, medicine, electricity and fuel, and continuing forms of siege imposed on Gaza have created a dire humanitarian situation in which Palestinians are dying of disease and hunger. Many people are suffering from acute food insecurity.\nThe UN Human Rights Office has repeatedly urged the Israeli forces to avoid targeting civilians and civilian objects, including healthcare facilities and personnel, and in any event to minimize loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.\nIn the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem, Israel has increased its use of airstrikes, attack helicopters, anti-tank missiles, shoulder-fired explosive projectiles and other weapons of war, resulting in destruction of civilian infrastructure, displacement, and the killing and injuries of hundreds of Palestinians, including children.\nAcross the West Bank, Palestinians are being driven from their homes and land, due to multiple coercive factors, including demolitions of property, settler violence, systematic discrimination, debilitating movement restrictions and Israeli forces arrests and often violent operations, which risks seriously deepening the already catastrophic situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\nFollowing 7 October 2023, Israeli authorities distributed thousands of weapons to civilians and drafted around 5,000 settlers into regional defense battalions. This led to a significant rise in violence by armed settlers and soldiers, including against children, with the distinction between state and settler violence further blurred during this period.\nFurthermore, free expression and civic space are under unprecedented pressure, with legitimate forms of speech and criticism being met with heavy retaliation by Israeli forces. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also continually called for an end to the suffering and urged all parties to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law.\nThe UN Human Rights OPT Office however continues to document serious violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law by Palestinian armed groups and the Israeli military, including possible war crimes and other atrocity crimes.",

(AP)\nIn Lebanon, the UN peacekeeping force said its headquarters in Naqoura was hit again, with a peacekeeper struck by gunfire late Friday and in stable condition. It wasn't clear who fired. It occurred a day after Israel's military fired on the headquarters for a second straight day. Israel, which has warned peacekeepers to leave their positions, didn't immediately respond to questions.\nHunger warnings emerged again in northern Gaza as residents said they hadn't received aid since the beginning of the month. The UN World Food Program said no food aid had entered the north since Oct. 1. An estimated 400,000 people remain there.\nIsrael's military renewed its offensive in northern Gaza almost a week ago while escalating its air and ground campaign against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Amid Israel's war with Hezbollah, a top UN official, Carl Skau, told The Associated Press he's concerned that Lebanon's ports and airport might be taken out of service. More than one million people have been displaced.\nIsrael's military said Hezbollah fired more than 300 projectiles over Yom Kippur, the holiest and most solemn day on the Jewish calendar. Hezbollah claimed a series of rocket strikes on Israeli military positions and said fighters engaged an Israeli infantry unit attempting to enter Lebanese territory.\nIsrael's military also said it killed 50 militants in Lebanon. Claims on either side couldn't be verified. Israeli airstrikes on Saturday hit multiple areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Nine were killed in Maisra village in the northeast. Four were killed in an apartment building on the edge of Barja south of Beirut. Rayak and Tal Chiha hospitals in the Bekaa Valley were damaged. In Nabatieh, eight people were wounded.\nThe total toll in Lebanon over the past year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is now 2,255 killed, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. More than 1,400 people have been killed since mid-September. It isn't clear how many were fighters.\n\"We will keep standing with the Lebanese people during these difficult circumstances and also with the Palestinian people,\" the speaker of Iran's parliament, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, said Saturday while touring the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut.\nIn northern Gaza, residents told the AP many were trapped in their homes and shelters with dwindling supplies while seeing bodies uncollected in the streets as the bombing hampered emergency responders.\nThose who rushed to the scene of the latest deadly airstrikes in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya found a hole 20 meters (65 feet) deep where a home once stood.\nAt least 20 bodies were recovered while others likely were under rubble, emergency service officials said.\nElsewhere in Jabaliya, a strike on a home killed two brothers and wounded a woman and newborn baby, the officials said. An afternoon strike on a home killed at least four people, including a woman, said Fares Abu Hamza, an official with the emergency service.\nIsrael's military said it killed more than 20 militants in the Jabaliya area over the past day.\nMilitary spokesperson Avichay Adraee told people in parts of Jabaliya and Gaza City to evacuate south to an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone as Israel plans to use great force \"and will continue to do so for a long time.\"\nIsrael has repeatedly returned to parts of Gaza as Hamas and other militants regroup. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90 percent of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times.",

        "content": "title: CIVIC Launches First Protection of Civilians Trends Report and Civilian Protection Index \n content: Washington, D.C., October 8, 2024 \u2014With more than 120 armed conflicts around the world and increased risk of harm to civilians in these contexts, Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) launched on Tuesday its first Protection of Civilians (POC) Trends Report and Civilian Protection Index. The POC Trends Report documents the impact that conflict and situations of extreme violence had on civilians around the globe in 2023, highlighting how the protection situation for many civilians deteriorated significantly over the course of the year.\nAccording to United Nations (UN) data, civilian casualties rose by 72 percent in 2023 as compared to 2022. The war between Israel and Palestinian armed groups, in its first three months alone, was largely responsible for the increase in harm to civilians last year. Across the world, places considered to be safe, such as schools and hospitals were regularly targeted, with attacks on educational facilities rising by 80 percent. In the year 2023, 280 humanitarians were killed\u2014more than double the number killed delivering aid in 2022.\n\u201cAt this time of heightened threats to civilians, governments, militaries, and other armed actors need to take seriously their obligation to protect civilians. We cannot look at these figures on civilian casualties, attacks on schools and medical facilities, sexual violence, and grave violations against children and conclude that it is acceptable to continue waging wars in the same way,\u201d said Lauren Spink, CIVIC\u2019s Senior Research Advisor and lead on compiling the content for the report.\nThe report also seeks to amplify civilian experiences and highlight underreported aspects of civilian harm, such as the intersection of climate change and security in northeast Nigeria, the enduring mental health impacts of conflict on children, and the search for redress in Colombia. These stories are told through spotlight articles from experts on the topics and contexts, including civil society leaders and humanitarians witnessing the trends first-hand.\nThe Civilian Protection Index was developed in collaboration with the Institute for Economics and Peace. It incorporates 15 protection-related indicators to assess the overall protection environment in 163 countries worldwide. Among the indicators used are direct and indirect measures of violence like civilian deaths, sexual violence, and the number of firearms circulating among the population, as well as attributes of protective environments, such as trust in government institutions and the quality of civic space.\nThe POC Trends Report and Civilian Protection Index are tools for policy makers, practitioners, academics, and journalists to understand and reverse the trend of growing harms that civilians are facing. To this end, the report includes a Roadmap for Action that states, as well as regional and international bodies, can follow to address and prevent harm to civilians in conflict contexts.\n\u201cWith this report and the Civilian Protection Index, we seek to create practical tools for those who have an obligation to protect civilians by o\\ering actionable steps they can follow and implement. There are a wide range of actions that can be taken to make sure the protection of civilians is a respected obligation nationally and internationally,\u201d said Spink.\nAmong the actions recommended by CIVIC are e\\orts to operationalize international legal obligations through national protection of civilian policies, the suspension of arms transfers if there is a risk they may be used to violate international law, as well as endorsing and implementing the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences of the use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas (EWIPA).\nFor more information or to arrange an interview, please contact:\nCIVIC Global Communications: comms@civiliansinconflict.org\nAbout CIVIC: Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) is an international non-governmental humanitarian organization that envisions a world in which no civilian is harmed in conflict.

        "content": "title: \u2018The fear is unspeakable\u2019: airstrikes on northern Gaza leave hundreds of thousands with nowhere to go \n content: At least 22 people have been killed in airstrikes in northern Gaza, with Israeli forces stepping up their campaign on the besieged Palestinian territory even as fighting in the new war in Lebanon escalates.\nOn Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) renewed its evacuation orders for Palestinians still living in the decimated northern half of Gaza, although many residents say the fighting and Israeli sniper fire make it impossible to leave.\nAvichay Adraee, an IDF spokesperson, told people that the area includes parts of Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood and sections around Jabalia, the urban refugee camp.\nIn a social media post, Adraee asked people living there to head south to al-Mawasi, a coastal area of southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of people are already displaced. A total of 84% of the territory is currently under evacuation orders, pushing civilians into ever-dwindling \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d which Israel has bombed regardless.\nThe UN says an estimated 400,000 people are trapped by the latest ground fighting and artillery fire centred in Jabalia, which has now entered a second week.\n\u201cIt is getting tougher every day. The fear and the conditions are unspeakable,\u201d said Badr Alzaharna, 25, from Gaza City. \u201cI cannot leave. I want to travel but I can\u2019t. Rafah crossing has been closed since May.\u201d\nGaza\u2019s ministry of health appealed on Friday for medical teams to be allowed access to the northern half of the strip to evacuate the wounded, and for fuel deliveries to the north\u2019s struggling hospitals, warning that civilians caught up in the intense shelling and airstrikes are running out of food and water. Seven World Health Organization missions were impeded from access to northern Gaza by Israeli forces this week, the UN body said. Also on Saturday, the World Food Programme, the UN food agency, reported that no food aid has reached northern Gaza since 1 October, with a 35% drop in the supply of food to families around the rest of Gaza, raising new fears of extreme hunger and famine that have already plagued the strip for a year.\nThe last food supplies \u2013 canned food, flour, high-energy biscuits and nutrition supplements \u2013 have been distributed to shelters and health facilities in the north, and it is unclear how long they will last. Israel has consistently denied blocking aid and food to Gaza.\nAirstrikes overnight on Friday on Jabalia destroyed an entire building and severely damaged several more, according to medics and first responders, who are still recovering missing people from under the rubble and ruins created by a 20-metre deep impact crater.\nAt least six women and seven children were among the dead, and a strike in another part of Jabalia in the early hours of Saturday killed two parents and injured their baby, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said. Hospitals across Gaza reported receiving a total of 49 bodies and 219 wounded people in the past 24 hours.\nThe IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest strikes and civilian deaths in Gaza.\nIsrael has nominally controlled the northern half of Gaza since the beginning of the year, and has cut the territory in two by creating what it calls the Netzarim corridor, which separates what was once the densely populated Gaza City from the rest of the strip. However, it has since frequently re-entered Gaza City and other areas in the north of the strip where it says Hamas fighters are regrouping.\nIn Lebanon, the health authority said that 60 people were killed and another 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, and the United Nations peacekeeping force that operates on the blue line separating Israel and Lebanon said its headquarters in Naqoura had been targeted a second time. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the fire.\nIsrael stepped up its campaign against the Lebanese militia Hezbollah last month after a year of tit-for-tat fire triggered by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack and the ensuing war in Gaza.\nThe new war in Lebanon has heightened the risk of a region-wide escalation drawing in Iran and the US. Ceasefire talks on ending the fighting in Gaza have been stalled since July.",

        "content": "title: Israeli obstructions to aid and attacks on humanitarian workers: M\u00e9decins du Monde's year in the occupied Palestinian territory \n content: Paris, October 3rd, 2024. How have NGOs been able to work and deliver humanitarian aid this past year in Gaza? While the International Court of Justice has warned of a risk of genocide, and war is escalating in the West Bank and Lebanon, Doctors of the World has released a report exposing Israeli obstructions of aid and the attacks that the organisation and its humanitarian workers have been facing for a year in the occupied Palestinian territory.\nIn this report, Doctors of the World presents a detailed account of events and data covering the period from October 2023 to September 2024, demonstrating how Doctors of the World\u2019s medical response is being impeded in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Some of the most striking examples include:\n- Doctors of the World staff members continue to be on the frontlines and provide aid under extremely volatile conditions while they are themselves unprotected, displaced, deprived of proper food and clothing, and vulnerable to bombings, diseases, and harsh weather conditions. Since October 2023, around 300 humanitarian aid workers have died. More humanitarian colleagues have been killed in Gaza in the past year than in any other single year of conflict, anywhere in the world. Doctors of the World lost a colleague when their building was bombed by the Israeli army in Gaza City on November 5, 2023. Most of our colleagues have lost loved ones.\n- Doctors of the World\u2019s premises have been raided and damaged by Israeli forces despite clearly following \u201cdeconfliction\u201d procedures.\n- Both Doctors of the World\u2019s staff and operations have suffered repeated waves of forced displacements due to Israeli military orders. As of September 2024, 92% of Doctors of the World\u2019s staff have been forcibly displaced. Doctors of the World\u2019s operations have been forcibly relocated up to three times (from Gaza City to Rafah, to the Middle Area, and to Khan Younis). Every time our teams regain a bit of stability, new Israeli displacement orders force them to start all over again\u2014their lives and our operations.\n- Only four trucks containing Doctors of the World\u2019s aid have been able to enter the Gaza Strip in the past year. Shipments were blocked for one to two months before they were allowed to enter the enclave. Doctors of the World had to wait eleven months for Israeli authorities to open a humanitarian corridor from the West Bank, a territory less than 50 kilometers away, where most of the supplies needed for the medical emergency response in Gaza are available.\n- In the occupied West Bank, all of Doctors of the World\u2019s teams report that restrictions on humanitarian access and movement have drastically worsened since October 2023. With the sharp increase in settler attacks and the escalation of Israeli military raids against Palestinian communities, the communities that are most in need of humanitarian aid are the most dangerous and hard to reach. Furthermore, on average, Israeli checkpoint delays are causing the entire team operating in the north to lose the equivalent of one full working day each week.\n\u201cMost of the events stated in this report could amount to violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. Israel, as the occupying power, has the duty to ensure the adequate provision of food, medical supplies, shelter, and other essential resources for the survival of the civilian population in the occupied territory. Not only are Israeli authorities failing in this obligation, but they are impeding the lifesaving work of humanitarian actors committed to providing for the survival and basic needs of the Palestinian civilian population,\u201d-President of Doctors of the World Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Corty\nDoctors of the World is gravely concerned for the safety and security of the Palestinian population in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as for its own staff. Doctors of the World has been relentlessly calling on states with influence over the parties involved in the conflict to take concrete actions, beyond mere condemnation, to ensure an immediate and permanent ceasefire, full-scale and unimpeded humanitarian access, and respect for international humanitarian law throughout the entire occupied Palestinian territory.\nPress contact:\nMaud Martinasso, M\u00e9decins du Monde International Network Communication Coordinator, maud.martinasso@medecinsdumonde.net",

Led by Navi Pillay, a former U.N. human rights chief, the panel members are independent experts and do not speak for the world body.\nThere was no immediate comment from Israel, which has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it and has not cooperated with the commission.\nIsraeli forces have raided hospitals in Gaza on several occasions, accusing militants of sheltering there. Palestinian medical officials have denied such allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes.\nThe report accused Israel of deliberately killing, detaining and torturing Palestinian medical staff, of targeting their vehicles and of restricting permits for medical evacuations from Gaza. It said those amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\u201cIsrael must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction of health care facilities in Gaza,\u201d Pillay said in a statement. \u201cBy targeting health care facilities, Israel is targeting the right to health itself with significant long-term detrimental effects on the civilian population.\u201d\nThe commission said children have borne much of the cost of such actions, pointing to attacks on medical facilities offering pediatric and neonatal care.\nThe panel also said it found that thousands of adults and children detained in Gaza had been subjected to \u201cwidespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence.\"\nIt said Israeli security forces had raped male detainees, attacked their genitals and forced them to perform humiliating or strenuous acts while stripped naked. It said children who had been detained had returned to Gaza unaccompanied and deeply traumatized.\nThe commission further said the abuse had been institutionalized by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. He has boasted of making conditions in the country's prisons as harsh as possible under Israeli law in what he says is an attempt to deter militant attacks.\nIsrael detained nine soldiers in July over what their defense lawyer said were allegations of sexual abuse of a detainee being held at a shadowy facility where detainees from Gaza have been taken since the start of the war. The lawyer denied the allegations, and their arrest sparked protests by Israeli hard-liners.\nThe commission also said that hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza were subjected to physical and sexual violence, forced isolation and threats, and given limited access to water, food and hygiene facilities. It said Palestinian armed groups were also guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and called on them to immediately release all the hostages.\nHamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead.\nIsrael's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people.\nThe International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, and the International Criminal Court is considering arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders. Israel has adamantly denied the accusations and says it abides by international law.\n___\nFind more of AP\u2019s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.",

        "content": "title: Fears grow that Lebanon may become another Gaza \n content: Fears grow that Lebanon may become another Gaza\nUN humanitarians in Lebanon on Tuesday described the massive challenge of trying to reach some 1.2 million people who have fled heavy Israeli bombardment and evacuation orders, driven by the fear that what happened in Gaza may befall them, too.\n\u201cIt's impossible to meet the needs of more than a million people who have been suddenly uprooted, displaced and dispossessed without additional resources coming in,\u201d said Matthew Hollingworth, WFP Country Director in Lebanon (From Beirut): \u201cThis was not a country that was well prepared because of all of the challenges that it's faced over the past years. So, it's going to be a struggle.\u201d\nOne week since the UN launched a $426 million appeal to help those affected by the Lebanon crisis, contributions have reached just over 12 per cent, or $51.4 million.\nAid teams are committed to helping all those in need and particularly the most vulnerable, but Mr. Hollingworth warned that many of those uprooted by the rapid escalation in fighting had little choice but to leave their homes with nothing.\nUprooted in a moment\n\u201c[We\u2019ve had] horrific cases of forced evacuation notices coming out with few hours for people to prepare and depart,\u201d Mr. Hollingworth said.\nFamilies displaced over the past year \u201cwho had prepared themselves\u2026are far, far better off than the much greater majority today who have left in some cases with only hours to spare before their areas have come under bombardment.\u201d\nAmid intense Israeli bombardment of Beirut and southern Lebanon linked to the war in Gaza, the seven districts in frontline areas south of the country bordering Israel and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs have emptied of \u201chundreds of thousands of people\u201d, the veteran aid worker reported. \u201cMany of these towns, villages and suburbs [are] now nothing more than rubble.\u201d\nPaying the ultimate price\nAfter COVID-19 and the devastating port explosion in Beirut in 2020, poverty levels have soared in the country that has struggled to host more than a million Syrian refugees, amid a long-running political crisis.\nIn a fresh appeal to halt the violence in Gaza, Lebanon and beyond, Jeremy Laurence from the UN human rights office, OHCHR, said that civilians continue to pay \u201cthe ultimate price, whether it be the hospitals being closed, a million people displaced, civilians killed, schools impacted; the devastation is beyond belief for all people in Lebanon as it is in Gaza. We can't let this happen again.\u201d\nShelters \u2018choc-a-block\u2019\nMore than 200,000 people now live in the 973 formal shelters located inside Beirut and the north of country, according to WFP. Some 773 of these \u201care absolutely choc-a-block full\u201d, Mr. Hollingworth said, adding that people in the south had decided to move not only because their land and homes had been destroyed, but because they had lost \u201cfamily and friends and communities and they are extraordinarily fearful of what comes next\u201d.\nThe aid agency update comes amid reported renewed rocket fire at the northern Israeli city of Haifa by Hezbollah on Tuesday. The armed group has been firing rockets at northern Israel since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, displacing tens of thousands of Israelis.\nHealthcare under attack\nAccording to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), 17 attacks on health care and healthcare workers since 16 September have left 65 dead and 42 injured.\nMore than 96 healthcare centres and health facilities have been forced to close in the south. Five hospitals are now not functioning \u201ceither due to physical or infrastructural damage\u201d, said WHO\u2019s Ian Clarke, Deputy Incident Manager for Lebanon.\nSpeaking via video from Beirut, he said that an additional four hospitals have been partially evacuated to maintain emergency services, with patients needing critical dialysis and cancer care referred to other hospitals.\nUN humanitarians have insisted on the need to keep land, air and sea access open to Lebanon, which is dependent on imports for most of its needs.\nA reported 1,900 hectares of agricultural land have been burned in the south of the country over the past year and \u201cprimarily in the last few weeks\u201d, WFP\u2019s Mr. Hollingworth said. In addition, 12,000 hectares of farmland in one of the most productive areas of the country have been abandoned and some 46,000 farmers have been impacted heavily by the crisis. \u201cOlive harvests in the south will not happen, bananas, citrus harvests will not happen,\u201d he noted.",

        "content": "title: Israeli strike on central Gaza school kills 28 displaced Palestinians \n content: At least 28 Palestinians were killed on Thursday when an Israeli airstrike targeted a Gaza school sheltering displaced people.\nThe strike, in which many more were wounded, happened in the city of Deir al-Balah, where a million people have taken shelter after fleeing fighting elsewhere after more than a year of war.\nThe Israeli military, meanwhile, pushed its old rhetoric Thursday claiming it had carried out a precise strike on Palestinian resistance groups, who had a command and control center embedded in a school.\n\"This is a further example of the Hamas ... organization\u2019s systematic abuse of civilian infrastructure in violation of international law,\" the military statement alleged.\nHamas denies such allegations. Medics said 54 other people were wounded at the school.\nIn the north of the enclave, the Israeli military is pushing on with an offensive begun six days ago, when it sent its troops into Jabalia, the largest of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps and the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya.\nPalestinian health officials say at least 130 people have been killed so far in the operation, which Israel says is aimed at preventing Hamas from regrouping.\nThe military has told residents to evacuate an area in which the U.N. estimates more than 400,000 people are trapped.\nThe health officials said the Israeli military Wednesday gave patients and medics 24 hours to leave the Indonesian, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals or risk being stormed as happened earlier in the war at the Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.\nIsrael, which has not yet commented on evacuation orders for medical facilities, has said Hamas has command facilities embedded in the hospitals, which it denies.\nHussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital said, eight patients, mostly children, were at risk inside the intensive care units should the army force them to evacuate.\n\"Those children were injured with shrapnel all over their bodies, the upper parts and the brain. They are all in critical conditions and are hooked to oxygen systems,\" Abu Safiya said in a video message to the media.\n\"The hospital is also running out of fuel, and the occupation is refusing fuel to reach northern Gaza,\" he added.\nAbu Safiya appealed to world countries to press Israel to allow medical staffers in north Gaza's three hospitals to continue to operate saying \"Our message is a message of peace for the sake of those children.\"\n\"We urge the world to allow us to continue (working) and permit all things needed so that we can provide safe medical care in northern Gaza,\" he said.\nIsraeli bombardment near Kamal Adwan Hospital has already caused some damage to the facility, medics said. Officials said they know of many fatalities lying on the roads outside the hospital because of Israeli fire.\nThe Israeli military told residents of Jabalia and nearby areas to head to humanitarian-designated zones in southern Gaza but Palestinian and U.N. officials say there are no safe places to flee to in the densely populated enclave.\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, told the Security Council: \"Hundreds of thousands of people are again being pushed to move to the south, where living conditions are intolerable.\n\"Yet again, Gazans are teetering on the edge of a man-made famine,\" he said.\nResidents said Israeli armed forces have encircled Jabalia from all directions, and ordered them to leave through one corridor. They said troops were interrogating those leaving and making arrests, while anyone trying to leave via a different route gets fired at.\nThe armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said they were fighting against Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets, and mortar bombs.\nThe Israeli military said it killed dozens of resistance members, located weapons and dismantled military infrastructure in the north.\nIsrael began its genocidal war in Gaza after the Palestinian resistance group stormed southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, causing about 1,200 deaths and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\nIt has since turned its focus to its northern border with an offensive against Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, in an escalation of the conflict that risks a broader war in the Middle East.\nIsrael has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians since, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced and much of the enclave has been laid to waste.",

        "content": "title: MAP warns of erasure of Palestinian presence in northern Gaza as Israeli military escalates attacks and forced displacement \n content: Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) is deeply alarmed by the Israeli military\u2019s forced displacement orders in northern Gaza that includes orders to evacuate critically ill patients and healthcare workers from Al Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan hospitals.\nHospitals, clinics, and humanitarian workers remain under siege as medical facilities in northern Gaza run out of fuel, medical supplies, and safe passage, leaving more than 300 critically ill patients trapped.\nThe Kamal Adwan Hospital has been forced to shut down most of its services as the Israeli military expands its invasion of the north, but the steadfast medical teams in the emergency department are still receiving and treating people injured in attacks. Newborn babies from the MAP-supported neonatal intensive care unit at Kamal Adwan have been evacuated to the Patient Friends Hospital in Gaza City \u2013 which MAP is also supporting \u2013 but ambulances are being detained at military checkpoints.\nFikr Shalltoot, MAP\u2019s Gaza Director, said: \u201cA year in to Israel\u2019s military assault on Gaza and Israeli forces are once again forcing hospitals to shut down. These are full of displaced civilians, medical staff, and sick patients, all of whom are protected under international law. We are deeply concerned for the safety of patients at the hospital, and the staff that have stayed to take care of them in impossible circumstances.\u201d\nRohan Talbot, MAP\u2019s Director of Advocacy and Campaigns said: \u201cThe Israeli military's actions in northern Gaza are systematically collapsing the little of what remains of the health system and eliminating the conditions needed to maintain Palestinian survival. Even if people are forced to flee, there is nowhere safe in Gaza for people to go.\u201d\n\u201cNine months after the International Court of Justice ordered measures to prevent potential genocide in Gaza, the catastrophic failure of the international community to take action to enforce a ceasefire has enabled Israel to ramp up its deadly assault. The world must act before Gaza is erased entirely.\u201d\nIsraeli forces have already forced over 70,000 people to flee their homes in northern Gaza, cutting off the area and subjecting it to intense bombardment, while evacuation routes are blocked or unsafe.\nIsrael\u2019s ongoing siege is isolating northern Gaza from the rest of the region, and obstructing humanitarian assistance. A MAP colleague who has been displaced from his home in the north in recent days fears he will ever be allowed return to his home.\n84% of Gaza is now under forced displacement orders, a tactic which the Israeli military is now mirroring in Lebanon with a quarter of Lebanese territory now under displacement orders.\nImmediate intervention is urgently needed to prevent the erasure of the Palestinian presence in northern Gaza. MAP calls on the UK Government to take urgent action to stop Israel\u2019s forcible displacement of Palestinians from the north and ensure that civilians, including those who choose to stay in their homes, are protected at all times.\nThe UK must demand the urgent protection of health facilities, healthcare workers and patients in northern Gaza\u2019s hospitals. The UK must also immediately end all arms transfers to Israel, and enforce Israel\u2019s compliance with the International Court of Justice\u2019s orders to prevent genocide in Gaza.\nENDS\nFull release available online at: https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1637-map-warns-of-erasure-of-palestinian-presence-in-northern-gaza-as-israeli-military-escalates-attacks-and-forced-displacement\nContact:\nFor media inquiries or interviews, additional quotes or testimony, please reply to this email or contact:\nEmail: press@map.org.uk Phone: +44 (0)203 869 1310\nAbout Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP)\nMAP works for a future where every Palestinian has access to a comprehensive, effective and locally-led system of healthcare, and the full realisation of their rights to health and dignity.Our team in Gaza were among the first to respond to the current emergency and remain one of the only international organisations working to provide humanitarian and medical services, including in the north.\nWhile our emergency response is mainly focused on Gaza, we are also supporting medical services in the occupied West Bank, amid a significant escalation of Israeli military and settler violence against Palestinians, and supporting the healthcare needs of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.\nFor more information please visit: www.map.org.uk",

        "content": "title: Why so numb? Media buries human tragedy in algorithm \n content: As I was sipping my coffee in the office in the morning, I was preparing the agenda for our newspaper as usual. As I skimmed through the news in the agency pools, I realized that I was adding these events to the agenda with a callousness that has now become a reflex in the face of wars, massacres and disasters. This is an example of the phenomenon of insensitivity instilled in us by the media environment.\nAs journalists, we face a 24-hour news cycle, and while preparing the news of one disaster, other disasters are already waiting on the agenda. This intensity can make people immune to pain and horror. So when did the world begin to accept Israel's genocide in Palestine as routine?\nSince Oct. 7, Israel has been killing the Palestinian people, yet it no longer receives the same initial reaction, though the Palestinians are still being killed just as they were from day one. The daily targeting of Palestinians by Israel has stopped being a headline and has instead become a grim routine. Is the growing indifference to human suffering part of the global media theatre? It makes me ask myself the question.\nToday, it wouldn't be wrong to say that headlines like \"34 Palestinians killed\" appearing daily in news agencies are presented almost like a weather report. The deaths resulting from Israeli attacks are treated as if they were just another routine news item or something too insignificant to be noted \u2013 this is nothing new. The media is normalizing this situation and we are adapting to it.\nOf course, this is not unique to Palestine. Here are some topics that I added to my daily agenda without being surprised:\nWe no longer discuss how many people have died but which tragedy will make the headlines. The world is getting used to pain. No matter how big the tragedy is, we consume it in a news cycle of a few hours. An 8-year-old girl named Narin may have been brutally murdered in a village, but days later, this news was replaced by a celebrity controversy on social media.\nRecently, in Istanbul, a 19-year-old young man brutally murdered a girl named \u0130kbal, whom he had been obsessed with for five years, as well as his other girlfriend, Ay\u015feg\u00fcl. After throwing Ikbal\u2019s severed head in front of her family, he jumped off the city walls and committed suicide.\nThis horrific incident has shaken our country for now, but it will fall out of the headlines in a few days. Even this atrocity becomes a quickly consumed news item, soon to be replaced by another tragedy.\nThe media has now turned human suffering into mere statistics. Pain and losses are presented through charts. When tragedies are reduced to numbers and labeled as a \u201cdisaster\u201d in headlines, our human response to them diminishes. Our eyes grow indifferent to thousands of deaths because these images have become just another part of our screens.\nIt is worth mentioning that the presentation of the Israeli genocide in the news in this way causes a global loss of empathy and inaction. We can say that the media is trying to dull our sensitivity to such events by making violence the norm and presenting inhumane practices as usual.\nIs this the new norm of humanity?\nThe media isn't just a mirror that reflects events; it's a force that shapes society. Of course, in journalism, the news cycle shifts constantly. However, we cannot let the continuous series of deaths become routine. At its core, the fact that dozens of people die every day is newsworthy in itself.\nAlthough new media technologies seem to have strengthened our ability to hold people accountable, it is shocking how ineffective we are in using this power effectively. While media reaches millions, these platforms serve more to manage perceptions than to pursue justice. Amid the posts on social media about the thousands of killed and injured Palestinians, the reality of \"genocide\" gets lost in the depths of algorithms.\nWhile we are talking about a country where dozens of innocent people are killed every day, the media can still debate who suffers more. The suffering of Palestinians is not just a news item; it is a human tragedy. The international media needs to address the Palestinian issue not as a headline but as a humanitarian issue because the constant repetition of such news leads to the chronicisation of the continuity of war and attacks.\nAs we scroll through content on our news feeds, mass deaths and atrocities have become as insignificant as the speed at which we reach the next post \u2013 a truly heartbreaking situation.",

Across the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. Amnesty International has documented Israel\u2019s cruel policies of segregation, restriction of movement, dispossession and exclusion across Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank and Israel itself, which clearly amount to apartheid.\n\u201cIsrael must end its unlawful, brutal military occupation of Gaza, East Jerusalem and the West Bank as ruled by the International Court of Justice.

We commemorate the over 41,000 Palestinian lives lost, and 1,139 Israelis killed. Amnesty International stands with Palestinian and Jewish communities here in Australia as we pass this devastating milestone,\u201d says Mohamed Duar.\nInternational Law must be upheld\nInternational law and the Geneva Conventions that were designed to protect civilian life from war crimes are at increasing risk of degradation to the point of irrelevance if repeated breaches of international law are allowed to prevail with impunity.\nStates, including Australia, must not \u2013 and cannot \u2013 accept blatant disregard for international law, including binding decisions of the Security Council and orders of the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court.\nAmnesty International Australia reiterates its call on Prime Minister Albanese, Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Australia\u2019s diplomatic apparatus to apply pressure for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, immediate humanitarian aid access for civilians in Gaza, the release of civilian hostages and to support the independent International Criminal Court investigation into the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Amnesty International also calls for the government to create greater transparency over Australia\u2019s arms exports to ensure that Australia is not supplying arms or arms parts to Israel via intermediate countries, to ban products from Israeli settlements, and for a pathway to permanent protection for Palestinians fleeing Gaza.",

The zone also remains unsafe for civilians and aid workers, as Israeli forces continue to repeatedly strike the area.\nThese forced mass evacuations of homes and bombing of neighbourhoods by the Israeli forces are turning the north of Gaza into an unliveable wasteland, effectively emptying out the whole north of the Strip of Palestinian life.

They must also allow desperately needed humanitarian supplies to enter the north as a matter of extreme urgency.\nThe latest move to forcefully and violently push thousands of people from northern Gaza to the south is turning the north into a lifeless desert.\nSARAH VUYLSTEKE, MSF PROJECT COORDINATOR IN GAZA\n\u201cAll of a sudden, I was told that we had to move from the north,\u201d says Mahmoud, an MSF watchman, who left Jabalia at night to find refuge at the MSF guest house in Gaza City. \u201cWe left our home in despair, under bombs, missiles and artillery. It was very, very difficult. I would prefer to die than to be displaced to the south; my home is here, and I do not want to leave.\u201d\nIsraeli forces also called for the evacuation of the three main hospitals in northern Gaza, namely Indonesian, Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals. These are operating at minimal capacity and have a total of 317 patients still hospitalised, with around 80 people in intensive care and unable to move, according to the Ministry of Health. These three medical facilities, as well as those that remain partially functional across the Strip, must be protected at all costs.\nThe MSF clinic in Gaza City received 255 patients on Sunday and Monday alone, as options for people to access medical care shrink by the day. For some people, accessing the few existing health facilities is impossible; our teams have received reports of wounded people who have died as they were unable to seek medical care.\nAmong those facing evacuation orders in the north are seven MSF staff who managed to find shelter in Gaza City. Five others remain blocked in Jabalia, where the Israeli forces are on the ground carrying out attacks.\nWe left our home in despair, under bombs... I would prefer to die than to be displaced to the south; my home is here, and I do not want to leave.\nMAHMOUD, MSF WATCHMAN IN NORTHERN GAZA\n\u201cThe latest move to forcefully and violently push thousands of people from northern Gaza to the south is turning the north into a lifeless desert, while aggravating the situation in the south, where more than one million people have already been squeezed into a small portion of the Gaza Strip and live in deplorable conditions,\u201d says Sarah Vuylsteke, MSF project coordinator in Gaza.\n\u201cAccess to water, healthcare, and safety is already almost non-existent, and the thought of more people fitting into this space is impossible to imagine,\u201d says Vuylsteke. \u201cPeople have been subjected to endless displacement and relentless bombing for the past 12 months. Enough is enough, this must stop now.\u201d\nWhile the Israeli authorities have recently declared a minimal expansion of the so-called humanitarian zone, the area remains subject to evacuation orders and is unsafe due to regular Israeli bombardment. Many people living in the zone are suffering from skin diseases and respiratory infections because of the dire conditions. The situation is even more worrying with the approach of winter and the cold temperatures that people will be exposed to.\nIsraeli forces must urgently halt evacuation orders in the north of Gaza. The relentless killing of people in Gaza must stop now, and an immediate and sustained ceasefire must be implemented.",

        "content": "title: Israel subjects northern Gaza to one of its most violent genocide campaigns, says Euro-Med \n content: An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is imminent as the Israeli occupation regime tightens its siege on the Jabalia refugee camp and Beit Lahia project in the northern Gaza Strip for the fourth consecutive day, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor warned in a statement issued late on Tuesday. \u201cIsrael is accelerating the pace of its genocide against the Palestinians there by carrying out mass and planned killings, as well as widespread forced displacements,\u201d said the rights group.\n\u201cThe international community, led by the United Nations, must act swiftly and decisively to save tens of thousands of residents who are being subjected to one of the most violent campaigns of genocide that the Gaza Strip has ever witnessed,\u201d Euro-Med insisted.\nIsraeli occupation forces have intensified their siege of the Jabalia camp and the surrounding neighbourhoods, including Tal Al-Zaatar, Al-Sikka, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia. The Israeli forces have also taken up positions in the west of the Gaza Strip, advancing as far as the Jaffa Cemetery and the Tawam Junction.\nWith air strikes, fire belts and artillery shelling \u2014 bombing homes over the heads of their residents \u2014 the Israeli occupation forces have been in large parts of northern Gaza since Saturday evening.\nDozens of people have been killed and injured as a result of this ongoing invasion.\n\u201cInitial reports confirmed that five Palestinian citizens \u2014 including a woman, a man and his son \u2014 were killed by the occupation forces for trying to escape the Jabalia camp while waving white flags,\u201d said Euro-Med. \u201cThey were executed.\u201d\nIn an extremely dangerous development, Israeli troops ordered the complete evacuation of Kamal Adwan Hospital, located in the Beit Lahia project, north of Gaza. The director of the hospital, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, reported that he received a call from the occupation forces telling him that if he did not get the patients and medical staff out of the hospital within a day, they would be in danger.\nAlong with two other hospitals in northern Gaza, Al-Awda Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalia, Kamal Adwan Hospital is only partially operational after being raided and destroyed in the Israeli military\u2019s first invasion of northern Gaza last December. On that occasion, the hospital\u2019s medical staff, patients and displaced persons sheltering inside were mistreated severely by the occupation forces.\n\u201cKamal Adwan Hospital is currently being besieged by Israeli quadcopter aircraft for the second day in a row, with smoke bombs being detonated at its gate and dozens of raids on nearby buildings,\u201d the rights group pointed out.\nThe sole road that ambulances used to move dozens of seriously injured patients from Kamal Adwan Hospital to the Baptist Hospital has been cut off, following the Israeli bombing of a building in the vicinity. This was followed by the occupation forces\u2019 tightening of the siege on the hospital, and the blocking of ambulances and any other methods of victim transport. Earlier on Tuesday, the occupation forces arrested a paramedic who was transporting patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital to the Baptist Hospital, despite prior coordination with the Israeli authorities.\nThe Euro-Med Monitor field team received testimonies from citizens who were able to reach Gaza City about witnessing dead bodies lying in the streets. \u201cThey told us that they saw victims trapped beneath the debris of bombed-out houses, and that ambulance and civil defence crews were unable to reach the area as at least 20 houses were targeted by Israeli forces in a four-day period,\u201d reported the NGO\u2019s field staff.\nThousands of people trapped in the Jabalia and Beit Lahia camps are suffering from a near-total absence of food supplies, which were already scarce due to Israel\u2019s closure of the border crossings. The limited amount of goods and other aid that had previously been allowed to enter the area was blocked by Israel for more than a week prior to the new invasion.\n\u201cNumerous families remain stuck in their homes, enduring harsh living conditions under the intensified and brutal Israeli bombing. Citizens are not even able to leave their homes in order to obtain water, and municipal crews and local committees are unable to assist them. As a result, thousands of residents face the threat of starvation, dehydration or death, knowing full well that they are all victims of the catastrophic effects of malnutrition brought on by Israel\u2019s year-long starvation policy.\u201d\nEuro-Med Human Rights Monitor called on the UN and international community to shoulder their legal and moral obligations to put an end to the horrific crime of genocide being committed by the Israeli occupation, which has just entered its second year.",

        "content": "title: 1 year into the Israel-Hamas war: The grim human toll by the numbers \n content: 1 year into the Israel-Hamas war: The grim human toll by the numbers\nHamas launched a surprise terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\nMonday marks one year since the Israel-Hamas war began, the deadliest in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nSince Hamas launched its surprise terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel responded by declaring war, thousands have reportedly been killed or injured. Israel has said its goal is to destroy Hamas and that it attempts to minimize civilian casualties as often as possible.\nMeanwhile, a humanitarian crisis has unfolded in Gaza, including the collapse of the health care system. The strip is seeing shortages of food, clean water and medicine, and famine is said to be spreading throughout Gaza, according to the United Nations (U.N.).\nTune into ABC News Live at 4 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 7, for \"Oct 7th: Race to Survive\" \u2013 special coverage of the anniversary of the conflict. Veteran correspondent Matt Gutman highlights voices of Israelis and Palestinians impacted by the war and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nHere is a look at the tragic human toll of the war over the past year, by the numbers.\nDeaths and injuries\nIn Israel, about 1,200 people have been killed, including about 800 civilians, 346 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers and 66 police officers, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nMost of the 1,200 were killed during Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Additionally, about 8,700 people have been injured, Israeli officials said.\nIn Gaza, more than 41,000 people have been killed and more than 96,700 people have been injured as of Oct. 3, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.\nAt least 10,000 people are feared to be buried under the rubble in Gaza, according to the U.N., meaning the true death toll could be much higher.\nIsraeli hostages\nWhen Hamas launched its terrorist attack, militants kidnapped nearly 250 hostages -- including women, children and elderly adults -- and took them into Gaza.\nAs of Oct. 3, 112 hostages have come out of Gaza alive, having been swapped for prisoners being held in Israel, Israeli officials said. The largest hostage release came on Nov. 24. 2023, during a pause in fighting.\nAbout 97 hostages remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 33 people no longer believed to be alive, according to Israeli officials.\nThe IDF has so far recovered the remains of 37 hostages inside Gaza, most recently finding six bodies in Rafah at the beginning of September.\nCollapse of health care system\nPrior to the war, 36 hospitals were functioning in Gaza, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nAs of Aug. 30., 19 hospitals have stopped functioning and the remaining 17 are partially functioning, the WHO said. There are currently no fully functioning hospitals, according to the global health agency.\nAid agencies have said their medical staffs have been detained and have come under attack, forcing them to evacuate facilities, which causes civilians to lose access to life-saving medical care.\n\"Our teams have been forced to perform surgeries without anesthesia, witness children die on hospital floors due to a lack of resources, and even treat their own colleagues and family members,\" Dr. Amber Alayyan, a medical program manager for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors without Borders) said in a statement earlier this month. \"Meanwhile, the health care system in Gaza has been systematically dismantled by Israeli forces.\"\nIsrael has claimed that Hamas uses hospitals to \"conduct and promote\" terrorist activity. Hamas has denied claims it is operating from within hospitals.\nAid into Gaza\nSince the beginning of the war, more than 1 million tons of aid have entered Gaza, of which 70% was food, Israel's Civil Department of the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories said in a post on the social platform X on Sept. 30.\nOn Oct. 2, Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, said more than 100,000 metric tons of food supplies are stranded outside Gaza due to access restrictions as well as the breakdown of law and order.\nU.N. experts said that famine has spread throughout the Gaza Strip but Israel denies claims that famine exists in Gaza.\nThe U.N. also says Gazans are living in \"abysmal\" conditions and that providing humanitarian aid continues to be a challenge.\nDuring a press briefing last month, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for the U.N. Secretary-General said nearly 90% of \"coordinated humanitarian response movements between northern and southern Gaza so far in September have been either denied or impeded.\"",

        "content": "title: Life in northern Gaza: A voice from the ground \n content: Aid workers in Gaza faces unprecedented danger amid devastation, says Norwegian Refugee Council's Salma Altaweely.\nBy Salma Altaweel\nThis opinion piece was originally published in The Big Issue.\nMy first humanitarian job was in 2008, the same year that we experienced the first large-scale hostilities in Gaza. Sixteen years later, the world around us burns again.\nIn all the escalations between then and now, I was always able to get out and help my people. This time, however, the tightened siege imposed on northern Gaza has confined me to a room in a rented house in Gaza City, where out of my window I can see piles of rubble and a blown-up building that was once someone\u2019s home. The situation was difficult 16 years ago, it is inconceivable now.\nSo much has happened in the last year, but I still remember joining my colleagues at the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) online on 8 October to discuss our response to a potential emergency when, a few minutes into the meeting, my neighbourhood in Gaza City was bombed. At midnight, we received warnings from the Israeli military that the area was about to be turned into a military operations zone. We left home for my parents\u2019 that night. Two days later, we were ordered to leave again. My house was bombed not long after, along with so many others in the area.\nThe first question was, \u2018Why, what have we done?\u2019 Since then, we\u2019ve been displaced ten more times. We fled on foot and under direct fire. Bullets flying. We only took with us the most essential and lightest things we could carry. We never thought that, for so many months, our only way to connect with the world and hear news would be through a battery-powered radio. It was like being in a cave, isolated from the rest of the world. Explosions were all we could hear. Gunpowder was all we could smell.\nAs each month passes, life is becoming ever more untenable in northern Gaza. We have been living under a siege imposed by Israel for 17 years, yet this is the first time we have come face-to-face with starvation. Without enough water, many come close to dying from dehydration. Fruits and vegetables are almost non-existent in markets in the north, so people rely on canned food. The prices in the market are astronomical: One kilogram of potatoes now costs around USD 80, and one box of 30 eggs is USD 107.\nParts of our days look borrowed from ancient times. We are left to improvise a form of life. In the morning, we collect firewood for cooking and bathing. Children queue up for long hours, trying to get hold of some water or a hot meal. Women spend most of their time making bread, hand-washing clothes, or preparing a meagre meal.\nSo many innocent Palestinians have been killed, including my sister, Rola. She had heeded Israel\u2019s relocation orders and fled Gaza City, along with tens of thousands of others, to Deir al-Balah. It was supposed to be safe there, but as it became clear, there is no such thing as safety anywhere in Gaza. Her husband was also killed, and their three children injured. They are now among the thousands of orphans this war has created across Gaza.\nWhat is extraordinary about this endless cycle of bloodshed is that it seems there is no distinction between a civilian, an aid worker or an armed man. It is as if killing has become a habit. Thousands, including children, have been killed in Israeli attacks on refugee camps, schools and overcrowded shelters.\nHundreds of aid workers too have been killed, making Gaza the most dangerous place in the world for humanitarians. Even when aid organisations follow the rules and orders of the Israeli army, they are not safe.\nNorth of Wadi Gaza, where I currently am, we have been recently able to restart activities for the first time since October and are operating in an extremely dangerous and restricted environment. My colleagues in the south, who have been displaced and experienced grave personal loss, insist they won\u2019t be deterred. They are working tirelessly to deliver clean drinking water and provide children with a space to play. Yet, our efforts have been largely crippled by Israel\u2019s restrictions and the breakdown of law and order. Our teams in central Gaza have had to relocate many times, adding to the uncertainty of aid shortages.\nThe devastation has wrought unimaginable suffering that transcends any class, allegiance or profession. As aid workers prevented from doing our job, we feel an additional burden. It is a duty that we always wanted to assume as Palestinian humanitarians working to improve lives and give some hope.\nWe can\u2019t help but feel that the world has abandoned us. We have learned not to hold our breath anymore. But we can only hope that the world will still come to its senses and find a way to end this carnage, end Israel\u2019s siege on the people, and allow aid to reach the hungry, ill children anxiously waiting only a few miles away.",

        "content": "title: One year in Gaza: how Israel orchestrated a media blackout on a region at war \n content: Journalists targeted and killed, newsrooms destroyed, internet and electricity cut off, foreign press blocked: since the start of the war in Gaza, Israeli forces have methodically destroyed the Palestinian territory's media infrastructure and stifled journalism. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) stands in solidarity with Gaza\u2019s journalists and reiterates its urgent call to the international community to protect them.\nSince the first bombs fell on Gaza on the morning of 7 October 2023, following Hamas' bloody attack on Israel, the right to information about what is happening in the Palestinian enclave has continued eroding with each passing day as the Israeli army\u2019s media blackout continues.\nIn one year, more than 130 Palestinian journalists have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza. According to RSF\u2019s information,at least 32 of them weretargeted and killed while working. Almost all the journalists in this closed territory have beendisplaced several times in the past year, and the few whohave been forced into exile have noprospect of returning. Meanwhile, Israeli authorities continue to close access into Gaza for foreign journalists. The few reporters who have been permitted to enter Gaza from the outside were only able to do so under the strict surveillance of the Israeli army.\nThe repression does not end there: press offices have been destroyed; reporters have been arrested and tortured, according to RSF\u2019s information; and internet and electricity are regularly cut off. Journalists who continue to work against all odds in this closed territory are frequently victims of propaganda campaigns that question their integrity, accusing them of working with combatants or havingparticipated in the 7 October attacks.\nThese shocking violations of press freedom have been met with widespread impunity. Despite the four complaints RSF filed with the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes against journalists in Gaza, and theassurances that the ICC prosecutor's office gave to RSF in January, the perpetrators have still not been brought to justice, and the crimes continue. Although the Israeli authorities have often claimed they do not target journalists, multiple testimonies, investigations, and even statements given by the Israeli army contradict this claim.\n\u201cA full year of war has meant a year of unprecedented violence against journalists, with Gaza's press corps now decimated and foreign journalists still barred from entering the strip. Israeli forces have done everything in their power to prevent coverage of what is happening in Gaza, and have systematically targeted journalists who have taken tremendous risks to do their jobs. This has in turn impacted the global public\u2019s access to information on the war, which is overwhelmingly in the public interest. Journalists have the right to do their jobs reporting on this war, and we all have the right to know what is happening in Gaza. RSF calls in the strongest possible terms for an immediate stop to violence against journalists in Gaza, for concrete actions to end impunity for the attacks that have already occurred, and for access to be opened to foreign journalists without delay.\"\nRebecca Vincent\nRSF\u2019s Director of Campaigns\nRepression beyond Gaza\nJournalists elsewhere in Palestine have also been subjected to violent repression over the past year, in the shadow of the war in Gaza. Since 7 October, dozens of journalists from the West Bank have been detained and remain in Israeli prisons. The headquarters ofAl-Jazeera in Ramallah were closed down by armed soldiers last September on charges of propaganda. A law approved by the Israeli parliament in November 2023 justifiedthe ban on Al Jazeera's channel in Israel that was put in place on 14 June 2024. This censorship also affects other outlets: on 21 May, the Israeli army seized a camera belonging to theAssociated Press news agency and cut off its continuous filming of Gaza for several hours on the pretext that these images were supplied toAl Jazeera, among other media. Israeli reporters criticising the war in Gaza and the policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government have also been victims of repression, intimidation, and police violence since 7 October 2023.\nThe war in Gaza extends to countries in the region : in Lebanon, three journalists were killed by the Israeli army while working, according to RSF\u2019s information. Although six investigations \u2014including one by RSF \u2014 prove thatReuters photojournalist Issam Abdallah was targeted by Israeli forces on 13 October 2023, no authority has been held responsible for this crime to date. A year later, the war has intensified and now Lebanese journalists risk finding themselves victims of massacres as well, as many of them have been forced to evacuate their homes and work from increasingly dangerous areas. In anticipation of the crisis, RSF openeda regional press freedom centre in Beirut in March 2024 to help equip and protect journalists in the region.",

        "content": "title: Protesters in Israel slam PM for neglecting hostages \n content: In a powerful display of anguish and frustration, families of hostages held by Hamas and activists blocked Tel Aviv\u2019s Ayalon Highway on Yom Kippur, accusing the Israeli government of neglecting their loved ones.\nThe demonstrators lit tires to spell out the words \u201cSorry we were taken hostage,\u201d calling for the immediate release of those abducted during attacks on October 7, 2023.\nYom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, is a day traditionally set aside for atonement and repentance.\nThis year, however, it became a platform for protest and grief as activists, alongside families of the hostages, demanded action from the government to secure the release of those still held captive.\nTheir message was clear: the government has failed them, and no forgiveness can be offered for that neglect.\nThe protests, which unfolded throughout the day, were organized by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\nThis group, which represents the relatives of the hostages, coordinated prayers at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where hundreds gathered to reflect on the tragedy.\nAt the same time, many blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government for prioritizing political survival over the urgent need to bring the hostages home.\nAmong the demonstrators was Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan has been held in Gaza since the October 2023 attacks.\nAt a press conference, Zangauker lit a torch outside the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) headquarters, apologizing to her son.\n\u201cA year has passed, and we still haven\u2019t succeeded in causing the government to bring a [hostage] deal,\u201d she lamented. Her voice, filled with a mixture of anger and sorrow, reflected the sentiment shared by many at the protests.\nOther speakers echoed Zangauker\u2019s frustration. Danny Elgarat, whose brother Itzik is also being held captive, accused Netanyahu of deliberately stalling negotiations for a hostage deal.\n\u201cHe wants to protect his reign, and he\u2019s willing to sacrifice you all for his personal interests,\u201d Elgarat said. His statement underscored the growing perception that Netanyahu\u2019s focus on political survival has come at the expense of the captives' lives.\nYifat Kalderon, another protester whose cousin Ofer is among the hostages, directly addressed the government\u2019s failure.\n\u201cYou say you have atoned for your sins. You cannot atone for sins that were committed on purpose. You are knowingly neglecting them. You know military pressure endangers them. There will be no forgiveness,\u201d she said.\nMany of the demonstrators pointed to Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign against Hamas as a reason for the lack of progress in securing the hostages\u2019 release.\nWhile the government claims to have weakened Hamas militarily, it has been unable to finalize a deal to bring back the remaining captives.\nMilitary invasion in Gaza have been cited as complicating efforts to reach an agreement.\nAt least 200 Palestinians have been killed as Israel\u2019s military siege of northern Gaza extends into its ninth day, leaving tens of thousands trapped amidst a ground invasion and relentless drone strikes.\nThe humanitarian situation is worsening as food and water supplies dwindle.\nIn southern Lebanon, Israel bombed the main commercial market in Nabatieh, causing major destruction.\nRescue teams are working to control a massive blaze and search for survivors.\nIsrael\u2019s air force has expanded its attacks beyond what it claims to be 'Hezbollah strongholds', targeting civilian areas, including a 100-year-old mosque in a border village.\nMeanwhile, wounded Israeli soldiers are being airlifted to hospitals in northern Israel after intense battles with Hezbollah.\nThe ground invasion continues as the conflict escalates.\nIn Gaza, Israeli attacks since October 2023 have claimed the lives of at least 42,175 people and injured 98,336.\nIn Israel, the October 7, 2023 attacks killed 1,139 people, with over 200 taken hostage\nOut of the 251 hostages taken, 97 remain in captivity.\nThis includes the bodies of at least 34 individuals confirmed dead by the IDF.\nDespite some progress\u2014Hamas released 105 civilians during a weeklong truce last November, and several hostages were rescued\u2014families say it is not enough.\nAttempts to broker a new deal have repeatedly stalled as the Israeli government shifts its attention to military conflicts with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\nThe protests in Tel Aviv were mirrored by demonstrations in Caesarea, where hundreds gathered outside Netanyahu\u2019s private residence.\nHolding Israeli flags and banners emblazoned with the slogan \u201cWe will not forgive,\u201d protesters lit fires to form the words \u201cThe neglecter is finished.\u201d\nThey accused the prime minister of willfully neglecting the hostages\u2019 plight since the day they were captured.\nDespite the passionate calls for action, the future remains uncertain for the families of the hostages.\nAs Israel continues its military operations, and negotiations with Hamas remain stagnant, families fear that time is running out.\nOn Yom Kippur, a day of atonement and reflection, the message from the protesters was clear: without decisive government action, there can be no forgiveness for the lives left behind.",

These sessions allowed workers to discuss their trauma and develop coping mechanisms.\nFounder of the organization, Eyal Kravitz, said he established the group days after the attacks as he wondered, who will help the helpers?\nThe workshops\nMany of the recovery volunteers who offered their assistance following the attack developed insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and high levels of depression and anxiety which caused a \u201cripple effect that impacted on their families and at their workplace.\u201d\nMashiv Ha\u2019Ruach\u2019s workshops were part of a retreat and took place in the desert, away from the \u201cnoise and distraction of daily life\u201d and encouraged participants to share what they had experienced.\n\u201cAt first, no one thought they needed to talk about their experiences,\u201d said Daniel Chermon, co-founder of Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach.\n\u201cSo, it was initially hard for us to convince them to come, but once they came, people started hearing from their colleagues about the value of the retreats.\u201d\nOz Tal, a first responder on 7 October, said the workshop gave him a \u201clanguage to describe and express his feelings.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, most of the volunteers, when I tell them to come to the retreat, they tell me that they\u2019re okay. They don\u2019t need anything. They don\u2019t want to come,\u201d Mr. Tal said.\nHe continued, \u201cBut during the retreat, after we start talking about our feelings, the first one starts talking and starts sharing their problems, then the whole group starts. You cannot imagine the spirit in the room in that moment.\u201d\nWorking with the volunteers\nAtzmon Meshulam developed the workshop programme and said the sessions help participants change the way they talk about what they experienced. She noted that many volunteers seemed calmer after the sessions.\n\u201cI received a message from the wife of a volunteer who attended the workshops. She wrote to me that she had got a new man back, that this was the first time that he had slept through the night since 7 October,\u201d Ms. Meshulam recalled.\nHodaya Leshem, one of the workshop attendees who is a mother of four and married to a soldier said, \u201cI had no support before I came to the meetings.\u201d\n\u201cI had to hold everyone in the family and community together, but there was no one there to hold me,\u201d she continued.\nMashiv Ha\u2019Ruach has now extended its workshop to partners of impacted staff and volunteers \u201cto build a wider network of resilience and support skills.\u201d\nTestimonies\nThe Soroka Medical Center, a hospital almost 25 miles from Gaza, catered to 680 patients \u2013 120 of whom were critically wounded \u2013 within 16 hours following the 7 October attack.\nWHO said many staff lost close relatives or lived in areas that were attacked.\nDr. Dan Schwarzfuchs, Director of the Emergency Department at Soroka Medical Center said workers would not have survived the job if they were not strong.\n\u201cI knew in my belly I had to find something that would help them stay resilient,\u201d he said.\nHe said therapy provided through the workshops helped foster bonds between staff from the medical centre.\n\u201cColleagues who before didn\u2019t want to speak about their experiences are opening up because they hear experiences from others,\u201d Dr. Schwarzfuchs said. \u201cPeople I didn\u2019t expect would ever attend are doing so now.\u201d\nThe retreat also was beneficial for Ayelet Harris, Head of the Community Department of the Kibbutz Movement, who said the sessions provided a space for responders to express themselves for the first time.\n\u201cIn the retreat, I felt that this was one of the first times I felt re-energized, as the focus was on me and my needs,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cIt was a safe place for me to express what I went through, and someone was there to listen to me\u2026This was refreshing and renewing.\u201d\nProviding support\nSince the beginning of 2024, Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach has helped nearly 1,000 people through their workshop retreats.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t start Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach under good circumstances. But the fact is that people need it and they\u2019re going to still need it for years to come,\u201d co-founder Chermon said.\nFounder Kravitz said their partnership with the health organization allowed for a wide reach of individuals.\n\u201cWe are proud to be the only resilience initiative in Israel that has received WHO recognition, thanks to the recommendation of the Israeli Ministry of Health,\u201d he said. \u201cThis partnership has been invaluable, and I want to express our deep appreciation for WHO.\u201d\nIn addition to supporting Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach, WHO has also assisted the Israeli non-governmental organization Mosaica through an initiative that involves\nreligious leaders from both Jewish and Muslim communities, to connect individuals with useful mental healthcare resources, increasing uptake and lowering the stigma of seeking treatment.",

Israeli human rights organizations described the move as an approach to allow soldiers and army commanders to escape punishment.\nIsraeli human rights activists have also called for an investigation into what they describe as the \u201csuspected torture\u201d of Palestinians, warning that this could cause damage to the government, reaching as far as the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nICJ Prosecutor Karim Khan announced on May 20 that he had applied for an \u201carrest warrant\u201d against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\nDeath of 48 Palestinians in Israeli prisons\nIsrael\u2019s Haaretz newspaper reported on July 29 that the Israeli army is investigating the deaths of 48 Palestinians in Israeli prisons.\nMost of them were detained in Gaza and 36 of them died at Sde Teiman.\nOn Sept. 18, Israel's Supreme Court rejected a request by human rights organizations to close Sde Teiman, despite evidence of violations at the detention center.\nOn June 30, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for the execution of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons by \u201cshooting them in the head instead of giving them food and water.\u201d\nOn July 8, Ben-Gvir pressed to keep Sde Teiman open, claiming that the detention center's \u201covercrowding\u201d with detained Palestinians \u201cis a good thing.\"\nOn Sept.12, he stepped up his far-right rhetoric, demanding an additional budget to build 5,000 new detention centers to double the number of Palestinians detained in Israel's war in Gaza.\n\u201cSince the beginning of the war, the prison crisis has been one of the most sensitive security issues and has still not been resolved,\u201d the local Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported on Sept. 12.\nHaaretz reported that \u201cin addition to Sde Teiman, Megiddo Prison in northern Israel is another prison where horrific crimes against detained Palestinians are constantly committed and systematic torture is practiced.\u201d\nLeaked documents from Megiddo record numerous cases of horrific attacks and torture against hundreds of detained Palestinians, including the use of dogs to humiliate detainees.\nIsrael has continued its brutal offensive on Gaza following an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas on Oct. 7 last year, despite a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire.\nMore than 41,800 people have since been killed, mostly women and children, and over 96,800 injured, according to local health authorities.\nThe Israeli onslaught has displaced almost the entire population of the territory amid an ongoing blockade that has led to severe shortages of food, clean water and medicine.\nIsrael faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its actions in Gaza.\n*Writing by Serdar Dincel in Istanbul",

In addition, there is no facility in Gaza that has capacity to take them as they are all overrun with their own similar cases.\u201d\nThe latest raids and strikes came on the sixth day of an Israeli offensive centred on the devastated cities of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun and the Jabaliya refugee camp, all of which experienced heavy fighting in the first months of the war. The offensive has trapped hundreds of thousands of civilians in fast-deteriorating conditions.\nFarther south, an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the central town of Deir al-Balah killed at least 26 people, including a child and seven women, Palestinian officials said on Thursday.\nDr Eid Sabah, the director of the nursing department at Kamal Adwan hospital, which offers paediatric intensive care facilities and a malnutrition clinic, said a fleet of ambulances evacuated some but not all of its patients.\nThe hospital is now running short of medical supplies as well as diesel for its generators, which means electricity and oxygen shortages. Doctors said 100 dead and more than 300 injured had been brought into the facility in recent days, including many children. \u201cUntil this moment, none of the workers inside the hospital was able to leave it due to the danger of the bombing,\u201d Sabah said.\nIsraeli forces issued evacuation orders to civilians in Jabaliya and other parts of Gaza before launching their operations but one resident in Jabaliya said they had been trapped in their homes by fighting and food was running out.\nHeba Abu Habl, who has three daughters and two sons, has been displaced 18 times since first leaving Beit Lahiya early in the war, and is now stuck in Jabaliya.\n\u201cWe have been trapped for days and we don\u2019t know where to go. All places are dangerous and are subjected to heavy and indiscriminate bombardment. In the end we decided to stay where we are \u2026 but we don\u2019t have water or food and we cannot sleep at night because of the intensity of the bombing,\u201d Abu Habl, 38, said.\nGaza\u2019s health ministry said it recovered 40 bodies from Jabaliya, a densely populated neighbourhood in northern Gaza, between Sunday and Tuesday, and another 14 from communities farther north.\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said on X on Wednesday that at least 400,000 people were trapped in Jabaliya. \u201cMany are refusing [to evacuate] because they know too well that no place anywhere in Gaza is safe,\u201d he added.\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the attack on the school in Deir al-Balah. Witnesses said the strike targeted a makeshift post of the Hamas-run police inside the shelter.\nIsrael has repeatedly attacked schools turned shelters in Gaza, accusing militants of deliberately using the population as a human shield. Hamas has denied the charge. Numerous strikes have targeted police in Gaza, who Israeli officials argue are part of Hamas, and who have now largely withdrawn from the streets.\nOn Thursday, UN investigators accused Israel of deliberately targeting health facilities and killing and torturing medical personnel in Gaza.\n\u201cIsrael has perpetrated a concerted policy to destroy Gaza\u2019s healthcare system as part of a broader assault on Gaza,\u201d the UN independent international commission of inquiry said in a statement.\nIsraeli officials say its forces do not target civilians and accuse Hamas of building command centres under hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. Hamas denies the charge.\nThe Israeli military said the latest raid was intended to stop Hamas fighters staging further attacks from Jabaliya and to prevent them from regrouping. Though the group has suffered significant losses, Hamas has continued to launch attacks on Israeli forces and fire occasional rockets into Israel in recent months. Israeli forces have had to return to many areas earlier cleared of militants.\nR Adm Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, said Israeli forces in Jabaliya had killed about 100 militants, without providing evidence.\nThe death toll from the Israeli offensive in the territory has passed 42,000. More than two-thirds of those killed are women and children, according to Palestinian health authorities\u2019 data. The statistics do not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.\nThe war began on 7 October last year when waves of Hamas militants broke through Israel\u2019s security fence and attacked army bases and farming communities, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Hamas is still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.\nThe conflict has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times.",

        "content": "title: Israel subjects northern Gaza to one of the most violent campaigns of its genocide; int\u2019l intervention required \n content: Palestinian Territory - An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is imminent as the Israeli occupation tightens its siege on the Jabalia camp and Beit Lahia project in the northern Gaza Strip for the fourth consecutive day. Israel is accelerating the pace of its genocide against the Palestinians there by carrying out mass and planned killings, as well as widespread forced displacements. The international community, led by the United Nations, must act swiftly and decisively to save 10s of thousands of residents who are being subjected to one of the most violent campaigns of genocide the Strip has ever witnessed.\nIsraeli occupation forces have intensified their siege of the Jabalia camp and the surrounding neighborhoods, including Tal al-Zaatar, al-Sikka, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahia. The Israeli forces have also taken up positions in the western region of the Gaza Strip, advancing as far as the Jaffa Cemetery and the Tawam Junction.\nWith airstrikes, fire belts, and artillery shelling\u2014including bombing homes over the heads of their occupants\u2014the Israeli occupation forces have been occupying large portions of northern Gaza since Saturday evening, 5 October. Dozens of people have been killed and injured as a result of this ongoing invasion.\nInitial reports confirmed that five citizens\u2014including a woman, a man, and his son\u2014were executed by the occupation forces for trying to escape the Jabalia camp while waving white flags.\nIn an extremely dangerous development, Israeli army forces ordered the complete evacuation of Kamal Adwan Hospital, located in the Beit Lahia project, north of Gaza. Kamal Adwan Hospital\u2019s director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, reported that he received a call from the occupation forces telling him that if he did not get the patients and medical staff out of the hospital within a day, they would be put in danger.\nAlong with two other hospitals in northern Gaza, Al-Awda Hospital and the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalia, Kamal Adwan Hospital is partially operational after being raided and destroyed in the Israeli military\u2019s first invasion of northern Gaza last December, during which the hospital\u2019s medical staff, patients, and displaced persons were severely mistreated by the occupation forces. Kamal Adwan Hospital is currently being besieged by Israeli quadcopter aircraft for the second day in a row, with smoke bombs being detonated at its gate and dozens of raids on nearby buildings.\nThe sole road that ambulances used to move dozens of seriously injured patients from Kamal Adwan Hospital to the Baptist Hospital has been cut off, following an Israeli bombing of a building in the vicinity. This was followed by the occupation forces\u2019 tightening of the siege on the hospital, and the blocking of ambulances and any other methods of victim transport.\nEarlier today, the occupation forces arrested a paramedic who was transporting patients from the Kamal Awdan Hospital to the Baptist Hospital, despite prior coordination with Israeli authorities.\nThe Euro-Med Monitor field team received testimonies from citizens, who were able to reach Gaza City, about witnessing dead bodies lying in the streets. The citizens also stated that they saw victims trapped beneath the debris of bombed-out houses, and that ambulance and civil defense crews were unable to reach the area as at least 20 houses were targeted by Israeli forces in a four-day period.\nThousands of people trapped in the Jabalia and Beit Lahia camps are suffering from a near-total shortage of food supplies, which were already scarce due to Israel\u2019s closure of the border crossings. The limited amount of goods and other aid that had previously been allowed to enter the area was blocked by Israel for more than a week prior to the new invasion.\nNumerous families remain stuck in their homes, enduring harsh living conditions under the intensified and brutal Israeli bombing. Citizens are not even able to leave their homes in order to obtain water, and municipal crews and local committees are unable to assist them. As a result, thousands of residents face the threat of starvation, dehydration, or death, knowing full well that they are all victims of the catastrophic effects of malnutrition brought on by Israel\u2019s year-long starvation policy.\nThe Israeli army is systematically working to empty northern Gaza of its residents and force them to move to the south, recently issuing several evacuation orders and dropping leaflets demanding their evacuation.\nIt is clear that the Israeli army\u2019s latest operation has no military objective or necessity; rather, it is intended to finish the destructive operations that, during three prior incursions, have affected over 85% of the buildings in northern Gaza. Additionally, it is intended to target civilians and force them to flee the area, converting it into a full military zone.\nSalah al-Din Road is now blocked from the Civil Administration side by an Israeli military checkpoint, and anyone attempting to use it to leave the camp is being searched. This afternoon, a paramedic was arrested despite prior coordination with the Red Cross, which belies Israel\u2019s claims about the existence of \u201csafe routes\u201d for displaced people heading south.\nThe forcible deportation of a population is defined as a crime against humanity under the statute of the International Criminal Court, and the United Nations and the international community must intervene immediately to save 10s of thousands of Palestinian residents in northern Gaza who face ethnic cleansing by Israel. Furthermore, the UN and international community have a legal and moral obligation to put an end to the horrific crime of genocide being committed by the Israeli occupation for the second year in a row now.",

        "content": "title: AIDA Statement: One year of devastation: marking the unprecedented atrocity crimes and suffering in Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel \n content: Over the past year, we have issued countless statements alerting the world of the horrific situation unfolding in Gaza. Each time, the same message was repeated with updated numbers reflecting the horrors inflicted on Palestinians, with no new words to describe the scale of what we are witnessing. On this one-year mark, we choose not to echo those warnings. What we want to say is simple: we never imagined the world would allow this horror to continue for so long, or for Israel to act with such impunity.\nThese last 12 months are not only a marker of the brutal violence inflicted on Palestinians but an indictment of our collective humanity. It reflects the failure of the international order\u2014particularly powerful nations whose inaction and enabling of Israel\u2019s actions have compounded Palestinian suffering and shattered international norms. This failure extends far beyond Gaza, undermining the very foundations of what the global community has strived to uphold since its establishment.\nAlmost a year ago, Israeli authorities declared a \"total siege\" on Gaza, with the defence minister publicly announcing: \"There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.\" This exacerbated the suffering caused by the existing 17-year blockade and decades-long dehumanising and unlawful occupation, which already severely restricted the flow of people, essential goods, services, and humanitarian aid while collectively punishing an entire civilian population.\nIn the last year, Israel\u2019s military actions\u2014including indiscriminate bombings, relentless airstrikes, and shelling\u2014have killed and maimed Palestinian civilians, including children, in record numbers. The widespread destruction of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and homes, has brought its healthcare system to its knees and made access to clean water nearly impossible while spreading disease. Starvation has been used as a method of warfare, with Israel restricting the entry of food, fuel, and medicine. The repeated unlawful forced displacement of millions of Palestinians has erased any sense of safety or dignity, squeezing them into ever smaller patches of land as Israeli military-designated humanitarian areas shrink to just 11% of the enclave\u2019s territory, fragmenting communities even further. These atrocities, in clear violation of international law, have caused an unprecedented human catastrophe, leaving Palestinians in cycles of displacement, suffering, and deprivation. A generation of children is orphaned, maimed, and traumatized, with the impacts set to last for generations, even if a ceasefire is reached. The devastation in Gaza continues to send disastrous ripple effects, destabilizing the region and impacting global peace and security, with consequences felt far beyond its borders.\nLast year\u2019s October 7th attacks led by Palestinian armed groups on Israelis were a devastating reminder of the cycles of violence that show no signs of abating. The deliberate targeting of Israelis caused immense suffering, trauma, and loss of life. These acts have inflicted deep scars on countless families and communities, and we unequivocally condemn them. As we remember those who perished, we call for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages and the thousands of unlawfully detained civilians\u2014whether Israeli or Palestinian. The protection of civilians must be a shared priority for all, and it is imperative that international law is upheld in all cases.\nThe United Nations reported an unprecedented number of children killed and maimed in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel in 2023, marking it as the year with the highest recorded grave violations against children worldwide since monitoring began. The data for 2024 is set to reveal even more horrifying realities. As humanitarian workers, we face immense risks as we attempt to deliver aid in dire conditions. More humanitarian colleagues have been killed in Gaza in the past year than in any other single year of conflict, anywhere in the world. Since October 7th, more Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank than over the 6 years prior to this date.\nThe unlawful, prolonged and belligerent Israeli military occupation of Palestinian territory continues to strip the Palestinian people of their rights, in defiance of international legal bodies with rising numbers of violations of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, including the widespread killing and maiming of Palestinians, the destruction of their homes, schools, and essential infrastructure necessary to sustain life. Furthermore, according to the International Court of Justice, there is a risk that Palestinian rights under the Genocide Convention are being violated, and Israel must cease any actions contributing to this. Third States are obligated to prevent genocide, including stopping arms supplies or military assistance that could be used by Israel in such acts. Failure to adhere to the ICJ\u2019s decision and its most recent advisory opinion as well as the historical United Nations General Assembly votes will send a message that states can be selective in their application of international law and will only fuel Israel\u2019s impunity.\nAs we mark one year of devastation and the collective punishment of an entire civilian population, we stand in collective mourning and condemnation of the atrocity crimes committed over the past 12 months. It is not too late for the global community to act. We urge leaders to implement a ceasefire, protect civilians, ensure humanitarian access, secure the release of hostages and unlawfully detained civilians, address the conflict\u2019s root causes, fully uphold international law including halting the export of arms to warring parties ensure accountability by triggering international mechanisms, and support investigations into these atrocities, and genuinely work towards an end of Israel\u2019s illegal occupation.\nIf the world continues to merely publish void condemnation, the principles of international law will continue to be weakened or disregarded, and we will risk setting a dangerous precedent for future atrocities and undermining of international mechanisms for justice and peace.\nThe Association of International Development Agencies (AIDA)",

        "content": "title: Israel after October 7: Between decolonisation and disintegration \n content: Israel after October 7: Between decolonisation and disintegration\nIt is difficult to predict what will happen in Israel, but history may give us a clue.\nA year has passed since October 7, 2023, and it is time to explore if we have a better understanding of this monumental event and everything that followed it.\nFor historians like me, a year is usually not enough to draw any significant conclusions. However, what happened in the past 12 months falls within a much wider historical context, one that stretches back at least to 1948, and I would argue, even to the early Zionist settlement in Palestine in the late 19th century.\nTherefore, what we can do as historians is place the past year within the long-term processes that have unfolded in historical Palestine since 1882. I will explore two of the most important ones.\nColonisation and decolonisation\nThe first process is colonisation and its opposite \u2013 decolonisation. Israeli actions both in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank in the last year gave new credence to the use of these twin terms. They transited from the vocabulary of the activists and academics of the pro-Palestine movement to the work of international tribunals such as the International Court of Justice.\nMainstream academia and media still refuse to define the Zionist project as a colonial, or as it is referred to more accurately a settler-colonial project. However, as Israel intensifies the colonisation of Palestine in the next year, that might prod more individuals and institutions to frame the reality in Palestine as colonial and the Palestinian struggle as anticolonial and dispense with tropes about terrorism and peace negotiations.\nIndeed, it is time to stop using misleading language peddled by US and Western media, like \u201cIran-backed terrorist group Hamas\u201d or \u201cpeace process\u201d, and instead talk about Palestinian resistance and decolonisation of Palestine from the river to the sea.\nWhat will help in this effort is the growing disrepute of the Western mainstream media as a credible source of both analysis and information. Today, media executives are fighting tooth and nail against any change in the language, but they would eventually come to regret its place on the wrong side of history.\nThis change of narrative is important because it has the potential to affect politics \u2013 more specifically the politics of the Democratic Party in the United States. The more progressive Democrats have already embraced a more accurate language and framing of what is happening in Palestine.\nWhether this will be enough to effect change in a Democratic administration should Kamala Harris win the election remains to be seen. But I am not sanguine about such a change unless the processes of social implosion within Israel, its growing economic vulnerability and international isolation put an end to the hollow Democratic efforts to resurrect the dead \u201cpeace process\u201d.\nIf Donald Trump wins, the next US administration will be the same as the current one at best or it would openly grant Israel a carte blanche at worst.\nRegardless of what happens in the US election next month, one thing will remain true: As long as these twin frames of colonisation and decolonisation are ignored by those who have the power to stop the genocide in Gaza and the Israeli adventurism elsewhere, there is a little hope for pacifying the region as a whole.\nThe disintegration of Israel\nThe second process that surfaced in full force in this last year was the disintegration of Israel and the possible collapse of the Zionist project.\nThe original Zionist idea of planting a European Jewish state at the heart of the Arab world through the dispossession of the Palestinians was illogical, immoral and impractical from the onset.\nIt has held on for so many years because it has served a very powerful alliance that for religious, imperialist and economic reasons, has regarded such a state as fulfilling the ideological or strategic objectives of whoever was part of that alliance, even if sometimes these interests contradicted each other.\nThe alliance\u2019s project of solving a European problem of racism through colonisation and imperialism in the midst of the Arab world is entering its moment of truth.\nEconomically, an Israel that is engaged not in a short successful war as in the past, but in a long war with little prospect of a total victory, is not conducive to international investment and economic bonanzas.\nPolitically, an Israel that commits genocide is not as attractive any more to Jews, especially those who believe that their future as a faith or a cultural group does not depend on a Jewish state and in fact might be more secure without it.\nThe governments of the day are still part of the alliance, but their membership depends on the future of politics all together. By this I mean that the catastrophic events over the past year in Palestine, alongside global warming, the crisis of immigration, increasing poverty and instability in many parts of the world have exposed how distanced many political elites are from their peoples\u2019 elementary aspirations, concerns and needs.\nThis indifference and aloofness will be challenged and every time it is successfully confronted, the coalition that sustains the Israeli colonisation of Palestine will be weakened.\nWhat we did not see in the past year is the emergence of a Palestinian leadership that reflects the impressive unity of the people inside and outside of Palestine and the solidarity of the global movement of support for them. Maybe it is too much to ask at such a dark moment in Palestine\u2019s history, but it will have to occur, and I am quite positive it will.\nThe next 12 months are going to be a worse replica of the past year in terms of the genocidal policies of Israel, the escalation of the violence in the region and the continued support of governments, backed by their media, for this destructive trajectory. But history tells us that this is how a horrific chapter in the chronology of a country ends; it is not how a new one begins.\nHistorians should not predict the future but they can at least articulate a reasonable scenario for it. In this sense, I think it is reasonable to say that the question of \u201cwhether\u201d the oppression of the Palestinians will end can now be replaced with \u201cwhen\u201d. We do not know the \u201cwhen\u201d, but we can all strive to bring it about sooner rather than later.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.",

        "content": "title: Rethinking the Narrative on Palestine: Towards a Feminist Liberation Agenda \n content: One year has passed since the world witnessed the intensification of war crimes and the horrific genocide in Gaza, perpetrated by Israel. This is the start of a blog series, which offers a nuanced feminist understanding of the longstanding, intersecting systems of oppression in Palestine. This piece interrogates power structures and uncovers the interconnectedness of patriarchy, militarism and colonialism in perpetuating the ongoing violence.\nOne year has passed since the world witnessed the intensification of war crimes and the horrific genocide in Gaza, perpetrated by Israel. It has not stopped, and the violence continues to seep into neighbouring countries, affecting the lives and the political stability in the region.\nThis is the start of a blog series that will explore different narratives outside the reductionist existing binary and will employ a feminist analysis framework for understanding the violence in Palestine as gendered \u2013 not as the result of a \u201cconflict\u201d but as a result of the intentional politics of settler colonialism\u2013the systemic displacement and subjugation of an Indigenous population by a settler group, enabled by patriarchal structures and militaristic powers.\nThese blogs will provide analysis on what feminist alternatives are there and unpack the root causes of violence through a feminist lens including: how settler colonialism, patriarchy and militarism intersect, analysing their impact on women, racialised groups, social structures, environment, and the broader political economy in Palestine.\nThe current dominant narrative of two groups \u2014 the Palestinians and the Israelis \u2014 fighting over the land is misleading. It overlooks the deeper, historic power structures of settler colonialism, patriarchy and militarism, and shifts the focus from the liberation of oppressed people to resolving a conflict. Such reductionist frameworks overlook the systemic nature of settler colonialism, patriarchal structures, and militarism and the role of imperialist powers in perpetuating the imbalance of power. In Palestine this has manifested in decades of violence. This includes; unlawful occupation, forced displacement, dispossession, ethnic cleansing, exploitation of resources and labour, and apartheid.\nBy ignoring the long-term gendered impact of systematic displacement, land appropriation and compounded patriarchal structures, these narratives fail to acknowledge the historical and ongoing injustices faced by Palestinians including Palestinian women. Settler colonialism is obscured, and the fundamental issues of Indigenous rights, self-determination and gender justice are overlooked.\nOur aim through these blogs is to open up space for thoughts, imagination, and discussions on how justice, feminist peace and equality could be achieved, hoping to advance a feminist agenda for liberation grounded in equality, justice, solidarity and collective action.\nA Feminist Lens on Ending Systemic Violence\nA feminist and decolonial critique of the so-called peace processes reveals the fundamental shortcomings as they surface the realities of colonisation and power imbalance. Peace agreements and mediation attempts have failed due to deeply entrenched power imbalances, geopolitical interests and the lack of acknowledgment of the settler colonial nature of Israeli occupation, which has meant that the root cause of the violence has not been adequately addressed.\nThe substantial military and financial support provided by economically and militarily dominant states, plays a significant role in enabling Israel\u2019s defiance and violations of international law. The U.S., for example, has consistently provided military aid to Israel and has used its veto power to block UN Security Council resolutions critical of Israeli actions. This alignment helps sustain Israel\u2019s settler colonial policies and allows for the continued expansion of control over Palestinian lands and the ethnic cleansing of the Indigenous population.\nExamining systemic violence through a feminist and intersectional lens helps us understand how deeply rooted this oppression is in overlapping power structures. It also reveals the urgent need to move beyond the dominant \u201cconflict\u201d narrative, which often seeks a superficial balance of power, and towards more profound and transformative justice.\nTowards a Feminist Liberation Agenda\nThe agenda for feminist liberation is deeply intertwined with the broader struggle for justice, equality and self-determination. This liberation agenda aims to dismantle all forms of oppression by recognizing the deep interconnection between colonialism and patriarchy. The fight against colonialism is inherently linked to the fight against patriarchy, as both systems rely on hierarchies of power, domination, and control. Gender-based violence and apartheid systems are tools used to maintain these oppressive structures, reinforcing one another. Thus, the call for liberation must simultaneously demand an end to both colonial and patriarchal violence in order to achieve true justice and equality.\nJustice could begin by dismantling settler colonial systems and patriarchal structures, as well as the apartheid regime through the restoration of Palestinian inalienable rights and sovereignty. A decolonial approach to justice would also include delegitimizing Zionist narratives that have justified land expropriation and the erasure of Palestinian history and identity. Restoring the names, cultural heritage, and historical significance of Palestinian places that have been renamed or erased is a key aspect of this process, as it should not only include the removal of physical barriers like the separation wall, but also decolonisation of narratives, where the dignity and self-determination of Palestinians are restored.\nSuch an approach necessarily brings the collective decolonial struggle of the Global South at the forefront, harnesses solidarity and movement building, and creates stronger links with other similar contexts, than merely looking at it as a particular issue between the two people.\nIn pursuit of moving towards a feminist liberation agenda, we will continue to collectively develop and advocate for feminist narratives with Palestinians and partners. These narratives examine the complex layers of oppression, as well as the gendered and racial violence created, reinforced, and sustained by colonial and patriarchal power structures. Through our blogs we will explore the root causes of militarism, colonialism, patriarchy, and the economic and environmental exploitation and dispossession in Palestine.",

        "content": "title: UN officials remember brutal 7 October attacks, reiterate need for peace \n content: UN officials remember brutal 7 October attacks, reiterate need for peace\nSenior officials from across the UN system underscored the need for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and across the wider region, in statements marking one year since the brutal 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel.\n\u201cThat day left deep scars on individuals, families, and the collective memory of the State of Israel and the world,\u201d said Tor Wennesland, UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, who is based in Jerusalem.\n\u201cToday, we mourn for the over 1,200 people, including many women and children, who were murdered in cold blood. Even a year later, the brutality is impossible to comprehend.\u201d\nRelease all hostages\nMr. Wennesland added that more than 250 people were also abducted from Israel and taken into Gaza, and hostages continue to be held in abhorrent and unimaginable conditions.\n\u201cMy thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those who were kidnapped. I carry their anguish with me every day,\u201d he said.\nThe envoy reiterated his appeal for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other militant groups. In the interim, they must be treated humanely and allowed visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\nCommit to peace\nAdding that the war \u201ccontinues to shatter lives and inflict profound human suffering for Israelis, Palestinians, and now the people of Lebanon\u201d, he called for an immediate ceasefire to ensure the safety and security of all civilians.\n\u201cViolence begets violence, and in these moments of grief, we must reaffirm our commitment to peace,\u201d he said.\nIn New York, the President of the UN General Assembly lamented that the Middle East \u201chas been witnessing death, destruction and displacement for too long.\u201d\nDialogue and diplomacy\nPhil\u00e9mon Yang emphasized the need for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of the hostages, and \u201ca return to dialogue with a view to finding diplomatic solutions to the conflicts in the region.\u201d\nHe added that no sustainable peace will be achieved military, and only a two-State solution based on the UN Charter, international law and relevant UN resolutions, can guarantee lasting peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the rest of the region.\n\u201cI call for all parties - Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah - to abide by their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law. I also urgently call for the protection of civilians and the unimpeded access to the much-needed humanitarian assistance,\u201d he said.\nRemembering survivors of sexual violence\nMeanwhile, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, expressed heartfelt solidarity with the victims of the 7 October attacks, their families, and affected communities.\n\u201cToday we stand united in remembrance of those who lost their lives and in unwavering support of the survivors who bear the scars of that fateful day, in particular the victims of sexual violence, a heinous crime that has devastating physical and psychological impacts,\u201d she said.\nMs. Patten recalled her mission to Israel earlier this year which concluded that conflict-related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, was committed during the attacks in multiple areas across the Gaza periphery, and subsequently against hostages during captivity.\nFurthermore, there are reasonable grounds to believe such violence against hostages may still be ongoing.\nCall for justice\nThe UN expert voiced continued concern over the plight of hostages still in captivity and reiterated her call for their immediate, safe and unconditional release. She also urged political leaders and those with influence over the warring parties to step up efforts towards ensuring their release.\n\u201cA year since these heinous attacks, victims, survivors, and their families deserve justice. It is of vital importance to ensure fully-fledged independent investigations into all allegations of sexual violence during or in the aftermath of the 7 October attacks. My mandate stands resolute in its offer of support to the Israeli authorities, in the pursuit of justice and accountability\u201d, she said.\nDeath, devastation, destruction\nThe UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, noted that the attacks were the deadliest in Israel\u2019s history \u201c- a horrific event that foreshadowed the devastation brought on by the Israeli response.\u201d\nThe staggering toll includes the more than 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals killed, and nearly 5,500 injured, while more than 41,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip, and 96,900 injured, according to the local Ministry of Health. Thousands more are believed to be trapped under the rubble.\nNearly everyone in Gaza has been displaced, many multiple times over, and there is nowhere safe to go. Civilians also face extreme deprivation, with limited or no access to healthcare, food, electricity or humanitarian aid, and children have missed an entire year of education.\nAt the same time, schools sheltering displaced families have been repeatedly shelled, healthcare workers and hospitals have been systematically attacked, and aid convoys have been continually blocked and even shot at, OCHA said.\nMeanwhile, in the West Bank, the use of lethal force by Israeli forces, along with rampant settler violence and home demolitions, have led to a sharp increase in fatalities, widespread destruction and forced displacement.\nCommitment to deliver\nOver the past year, Israel has blocked humanitarian access both into and within Gaza, crippling aid operations. More than 300 aid workers have also been killed, the vast majority from the UN agency that assists Palestine refugees, UNRWA. This is more than in any other single crisis, OCHA said, making Gaza the most dangerous place in the world for aid workers.\nYet despite the immense risks, humanitarians continue to deliver aid when and where they can. They have also vaccinated more than 560,000 young children against polio during the first phase of an emergency vaccination campaign.\nOCHA said that although this represents an example of what can be achieved when aid workers can reach people in need, such examples are few.\n\u201cIt has been 12 months of unrelenting tragedy \u2013 this must end,\u201d said Joyce Msuya, UN Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.\n\u201cMember States must wield their influence to ensure respect for international humanitarian law and human rights and compliance with the rulings of the International Court of Justice. They must also work to end impunity. An immediate ceasefire and durable peace are long overdue.\u201d",

        "content": "title: One year on: This war is changing us all \n content: One year on: This war is changing us all\nSince the 1948 Nakba, the tent has been a central symbol of the Palestinian narrative, representing displacement and a life of misery.\nTents are meant to be temporary shelters in times of conflict, as we wait and hope that the tragedy will end soon. A prolonged tent life, however - as we have seen since the start of Israel\u2019s genocidal war on Gaza a year ago - suggests that this hope has been shattered.\nFrom the outset of this war, it was clear that mass displacement was a key part of Israel\u2019s plan. The Israeli government swiftly urged hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to leave their homes, instructing those in the north to flee south.\nAs the army\u2019s massacres intensified, including the destruction of entire residential blocks and the bombing of \u201csafe\u201d zones such as hospitals and schools, displaced people were forced to flee over and over again. Residents of Khan Younis flooded Rafah, only to return again to a destroyed Khan Younis.\nEverywhere the army entered, it left a widespread path of destruction in its wake. Around two-thirds of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or razed in the ongoing Israeli bombardments.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nMany Palestinians have lost everything they owned: homes, land, furniture, businesses. They have suddenly found themselves with nothing but a tent, a few blankets and mattresses, and some simple tools they salvaged from the rubble of their homes.\nBut even obtaining a tent can be a difficult task, due to the limited quantities and sheer numbers of displaced Palestinians in Gaza. Some have instead taken refuge in schools, where education has been disrupted for the second year in a row, or on small pieces of land demarcated by strips of cloth.\nEndless challenges\nLife in a tent comes with an endless series of challenges. With no electricity in Gaza since the war began, total darkness prevails at night, broken only by fires or the light generated by solar-powered lamps.\nObtaining water is a daily struggle, with people lining up in long queues to fill gallon jugs, which they must then transport long distances back to their tents. Toilets are created by digging pits in the ground. Sewage is no longer treated, and piles of rubbish remain uncollected, fuelling the spread of disease.\nFollow Middle East Eye's live coverage of the Israel-Palestine war\nThe lack of food across Gaza compounds our daily suffering. Because of Israel\u2019s strict blockade, many items that were readily available in markets before the war have now disappeared. When you can get food, the price has soared, sometimes up to tenfold when compared with prewar days.\nBecause most people have no sources of income these days, many are unable to afford food for their families. Their only options are the charity kitchens set up by volunteer activists, but even these cannot meet the needs of all people, and the food they distribute is often of poor quality.\nIt feels as though the world has abandoned us to the whims of a colonial, genocidal regime - and there is no sign of hope that this will end anytime soon\nMany Palestinians in Gaza have become emaciated due to the lack of food, to the extent that residents in the north have shared a darkly humorous assertion: if you see someone who hasn\u2019t lost weight during the war, they might be working as a spy for Israel.\nLiving in a tent, even the simplest things become distant dreams. Markets are empty. If your clothes or shoes become worn out, you must keep wearing them anyway, because there are no replacements. Even the most basic hygiene items, like soap bars or shampoo bottles, are unavailable or exorbitantly priced.\nLiving in a tent, you come to miss even the basic comfort of a wall to lean your back against, so cruel is this deprivation. You also come to recognise strange new types of insects that you\u2019d never before seen in your life. You\u2019re lucky if it\u2019s not a dangerous, venomous one.\nPsychological pressure\nIn tents, families have absolutely no privacy. The tents are packed tightly together, and everyone is under immense psychological pressure due to the humiliating conditions that rob them of their dignity. It\u2019s common to hear couples or children arguing; you are forced, unwillingly, to know all the details of their quarrel, because you cannot help but hear them.\nIt\u2019s also tough to find a spot to pitch your tent after being displaced from one area to the next. Even before the war, Gaza was among the most densely populated places on earth. The situation is even worse now, with entire neighbourhoods razed and the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people crammed into a significantly smaller area.\nDisplaced people are crowded along the seashore, in hospital courtyards, in schools and even on pavements. Finding a place to pitch a tent entails an exhausting search.\nAnd there\u2019s no guarantee of safety, as Israeli warplanes have repeatedly bombed tents, instantly killing their inhabitants. Palestinians are forced to clean up the remains and erect new tents atop such tragedies.\nI saw this process unfold once, and I was shocked. How could someone bear to live in a place where a slaughter had occurred just a few hours earlier; where a person\u2019s body had lain in pieces? I shared my astonishment with a friend, who replied: \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t put up his tent, someone else would have done so right away.\u201d\nThis war is changing us all. When will the volume of tragedy satisfy Israel\u2019s appetite for punishing the Palestinian people?\nWarplanes never stop circling above our tents. At night, when you close your eyes, you hear that terrifying hum, and wonder whether you will see the next morning.\nWhen residents of northern Gaza were displaced from their homes at the beginning of this war a year ago, many thought it would last only days or weeks. As a result, many families separated, with some staying up north and others moving south. But with the Israeli army preventing people from returning home, these separations have lasted much longer.\nA full year has passed in this tragic situation. It feels as though the world has abandoned us to the whims of a colonial, genocidal regime - and there is no sign of hope that this will end anytime soon.\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.\nMiddle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

Among them, more than 160 children.\nCivilian life is increasingly militarized, and settlement activity is expanding aggressively.\nThe Israeli Security Forces routinely destroy public infrastructure during military operations, inflicting collective punishment on Palestinians.\nLebanon is the latest casualty of this widening conflict.\nCivilians are paying a heavy price.\nAir strikes by Israeli forces are killing and injuring thousands, and displacing hundreds of thousands, while Hezbollah continues to attack Israel with rockets.\nUNRWA has opened 11 shelters in Lebanon, hosting more than 4,500 Lebanese, Palestinian and Syrian displaced persons.\nThe need for the Agency\u2019s services in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and Lebanon has never been greater.\nAnd we have never been under fiercer attack.\nExcellencies,\nThe blatant disregard for international humanitarian law, and a near total breakdown of civil order, is crippling the humanitarian response in Gaza.\nGaza is the most dangerous place in the world for aid workers \u2013 226 UNRWA personnel have been killed in 12 months.\nUnited Nations premises, including two-thirds of UNRWA\u2019s buildings, have been damaged or destroyed.\nOur premises have also been used for military purposes by Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, and the Israeli Security Forces.\nHumanitarian aid convoys are looted by armed gangs and obstructed by Israeli soldiers defying their own chain of command.\nWithout a lasting ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, and unfettered humanitarian access, the aid operation will collapse, plunging two million people into chaos.\n***\nIn the broader occupied Palestinian territory, the Agency\u2019s operational space is shrinking.\nSenior Israeli officials have described destroying UNRWA as a war goal.\nLegislation to end our operations is ready for final adoption by the Israeli Knesset.\nIt seeks to ban UNRWA\u2019s presence and operations in the territory of Israel, revoking its privileges and immunities, in violation of international law.\nIf the bills are adopted, the consequences will be severe.\nOperationally, the entire humanitarian response in Gaza \u2013 which rests on UNRWA\u2019s infrastructure \u2013 may disintegrate.\nCoordination with Israel would cease, further disrupting the provision of shelter, food, and healthcare to people in desperate need as winter approaches.\nMore than 650,000 children would lose any hope of resuming their education and an entire generation would be sacrificed.\nIn the West Bank, the delivery of education, primary healthcare and emergency aid to hundreds of thousands of Palestine Refugees would grind to a halt.\nLegally, the Knesset legislation violates Israel\u2019s obligations under the United Nations Charter and international law.\nIt defies the will of the international community expressed through General Assembly resolution 302 on UNRWA, and deepens violations recognized by the International Court of Justice.\nPolitically, the anti-UNRWA legislation, which is part of a broader campaign to dismantle the Agency, seeks to strip Palestinians from their refugee status, and change \u2013 unilaterally \u2013 the parameters for a future political solution.\nMadam President,\nThese attacks set a grave precedent for other conflict situations where governments may wish to eliminate an inconvenient United Nations presence.\nThey target not just UNRWA, but any individual or entity calling for compliance with international law and a peaceful political solution.\nFailing to push back against attempts to intimidate and undermine the United Nations in the occupied Palestinian territory will eventually compromise humanitarian and human rights work worldwide.\nThis Council must decide to which extent it will tolerate acts that strike at the heart of multilateralism and compromise international peace and security.\nThe climate of impunity that prevails will not dissipate without decisive action.\nWe can uphold the UN Charter and enforce international law, including the Geneva Conventions and the decisions of international courts, without exception.\nOr we can concede that the post-World War II rules-based international order is at an end.\nThe devastation of the past year should pull us back from the brink of creating dangerous new norms of warfare and reneging on our decades-long commitment to Palestine Refugees.\nUNRWA is an integral part of the United Nations, which anchors the multilateral system.\nI urge you to shield this UN agency from efforts to end its mandate, arbitrarily and prematurely, in the absence of a long-promised political solution.\nThank you.",

        "content": "title: UN mission says Israeli tanks forcibly entered base in southern Lebanon \n content: The UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has said two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered a base in the south of the country as Israel\u2019s ground operation against Hezbollah moved deeper into Lebanese territory.\nThe incident in Ramyah on Sunday morning was the latest in a string of violations that Unifil, the UN force deployed since 1978 to southern Lebanon, has blamed on the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nAfter the tanks left, shells exploded about 100 metres from the base, and the ensuing smoke left 15 staffers needing medical treatment for unusual symptoms despite the use of gas masks. Unifil also accused the Israeli military of holding up a logistics convoy.\nIn a statement released late on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Merkava tank had been trying to evacuate injured soldiers and had backed into the Unifil post accidentally.\nFive peacekeepers have been injured since Friday as Israeli ground troops have begun to advance farther north in Lebanon after two weeks of intense fighting and airstrikes. The death toll in the small Mediterranean country now stands at more than 1,400 since late September, after intense Israeli airstrikes overnight on the centre of the southern city of Nabatieh.\nUnifil said it had requested an explanation from the IDF for what it called \u201cshocking violations\u201d.\nIn a videoed statement addressed to the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated Israeli calls for Unifil troops to evacuate.\n\u201cThe time has come for you to withdraw Unifil from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields.\u201d\nHe later said on X: \u201cIsrael will make every effort to prevent Unifil casualties and will do what it takes to win the war.\u201d\nLate on Sunday, UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric said: \u201cUnifil peacekeepers remain in all positions and the UN flag continues to fly.\n\u201cThe secretary-general reiterates that Unifil personnel and its premises must never be targeted. Attacks against peacekeepers are in breach of international law, including international humanitarian law. They may constitute a war crime,\u201d he said.\nIsrael argues that Unifil has failed in its mission to uphold a UN resolution from two decades ago that was supposed to ensure that Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-allied Lebanese militia, withdrew from the border area.\nIn the three weeks since a year of tit-for-tat cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah escalated into all-out war, the 10,000-strong Unifil force from 50 different countries has refused to leave 29 positions across southern Lebanon, citing the same UN resolution, which ensures freedom of movement for its staff.\nIsraeli forces have repeatedly fired on medics and first responders as well as Unifil peacekeepers since Israel invaded Lebanon on 1 October, amid growing international opprobrium.\nHezbollah had begun firing on Israel the day after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack that triggered the new war, ostensibly in solidarity with the Palestinian group. The IDF accuses Hezbollah of using ambulances to carry fighters and weapons and says Hezbollah operates in the vicinity of the peacekeepers, but has not provided evidence.\nRelations between Israel and the UN, frosty for decades, have reached a nadir since the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023. In territory under its control, Israel is attempting to close down Unrwa, the world body\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, accusing it of routinely employing Hamas operatives. The UN fired nine staff members implicated in the 7 October attack but an investigation stressed that Israel had not provided evidence for its main allegations.\nIsrael\u2019s foreign minister, Israel Katz, reiterated on Sunday that Guterres was barred from entering the country due to what Katz described as \u201cantisemitic and anti-Israel conduct\u201d.\nElsewhere in Lebanon, at least three people were killed and dozens wounded in Israeli airstrikes overnight in which mosques and residential buildings were targeted, after strikes on several villages on Saturday killed 15. The IDF said it had hit 200 Hezbollah sites over the past 24 hours.\nHezbollah responded with rocket barrages fired across northern and central Israel on Sunday, most of which were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems. Israel\u2019s N12 News television said at least 67 people were wounded after what Hezbollah said was its attack on a camp of the Israeli military\u2019s Golani Brigade in Binyamina, northern Israel.\nAlso over the weekend, Israel ordered residents of another 23 villages across southern Lebanon to evacuate north. About 1.2 million people \u2013 a quarter of the population \u2013 have been driven from their homes since fighting escalated three weeks ago when Israel killed much of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership in airstrikes, including its secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli evacuation directives now cover a quarter of the country.\nIn the Gaza Strip, fierce fighting in the Jabaliya area of Gaza City that the UN estimates has left 400,000 people trapped with dwindling water and food supplies entered a second week. The World Food Programme, the UN food agency, reported on Saturday that no food aid had reached northern Gaza since 1 October, raising new fears of famine and extreme hunger.\nAn Israeli strike on the central town of Deir al-Balah on Sunday killed a family of eight, local medics said.\nThe region is still bracing for an anticipated Israeli response to an unprecedented missile attack by Iran two weeks ago, launched in support of its Lebanese ally after Israel\u2019s ground invasion.\nNBC reported on Saturday that US officials believed Israel had narrowed down targets to military and energy infrastructure. Miscalculation could propel Iran and Israel into a full-scale war. The US, Israel\u2019s staunch ally, is wary of being drawn into the fighting and of negative impacts on the global oil industry.\nIn a social media post, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said on Sunday there were \u201cno red lines\u201d for Tehran on the issue of defending itself, and indirectly threatened US forces against operating in Israel.\n\u201cThe US has been delivering record amount of arms to Israel,\u201d he said on X. \u201cIt is now also putting lives of its troops at risk by deploying them to operate US missile systems in Israel.\n\u201cWhile we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests.\u201d\nLater on Sunday, the Pentagon confirmed that the US would send a sophisticated anti-missile system known as Thaad and operator troops to Israel to protect from missile attacks such as those launched against the Jewish state by Iran in April and September.",

        "content": "title: Palestinians ordered to flee northern Gaza as Israel moves towards 'general's plan' \n content: Palestinians ordered to flee northern Gaza as Israel moves towards 'general's plan'\nThe Israeli military launched a major new offensive on the Jabalia refugee camp on Wednesday, suggesting it was implementing a controversial \"general's plan\" that would see the forcible expulsion of the entire population of northern parts of Gaza.\nThe army, which dropped leaflets over the camp and other areas of northern Gaza on Monday, ordered all Palestinians to flee south to the already overcrowded Mawasi \"humanitarian zone\", an area which has repeatedly been targeted by Israeli forces in the year-long war.\n\"We reiterate our call that you in the Jabalia camp evacuate your homes and shelters immediately,\" Avichay Adraee, the army's Arabic-language spokesperson said in a video posted on X on Wednesday.\n\"This is your chance. Move now without delay from your shelters and homes to the southern Gaza Strip.\"\nThe spokesperson's comments came as Israeli tanks pushed deeper into Jabalia as fighter jets pounded the area after the Israeli military issued fresh expulsion orders for almost all of northern Gaza, particularly Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia, where at least 400,000 remain.\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch\nSign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\nThe Palestinian civil defence said the strikes had targeted civilians and their homes, \"causing significant fear and terror\" among residents.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent Society said that its teams were receiving urgent pleas to remove casualties but were unable to respond due to the intensity of the bombardment.\n\"Soldiers are firing at anyone who moves in the Be\u2019e al-Na\u2019ja area, west of Jabalia in northern Gaza,\" they reported. Meanwhile, residents took to social media with frantic posts warning that \"Jabalia is being wiped out.\"\nThe renewed assault, which began on Sunday when Israeli tanks encircled the camp, has killed at least 19 people so far, according to the Palestinian civil defence, and trapped most of Jabalia\u2019s residents inside.\n\u201cOnce again, we see mounting catastrophic evidence that Israel looks like it may be committing the war crime of forced displacement,\u201d Nadia Hardman, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, told MEE.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen repeatedly that evacuation orders have put people in harm\u2019s way, and that evacuation areas are in fact not safe and people don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d she added.\nDrones firing at everyone\nPalestinians attempting to flee the camp have also been shot at, according to residents and footage shared with CNN.\n\"Drones were firing at everyone passing by on the road,\" 28-year-old Mohammed Sultan told CNN.\n\"Three people were shot right in front of me. My brother and I tried to help the injured get to the hospitals, but a little girl was shot in the neck, and her father was also injured.\"\nHassan Hamad, a 19-year-old journalist and Jabalia resident, was killed in an Israeli missile attack on his home on Sunday following threats from Israeli officials instructing him to stop filming Israeli attacks in Gaza.\nPhillipe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said that many people are refusing to leave their homes, knowing there is no safe place in Gaza to flee to.\nHe reported in a post on X that at least 400,000 people were \"trapped\" in northern Gaza, where there is \"no end to hell\", warning that with no basic supplies available, \"hunger is spreading and deepening again\".\nHe added that the incursion has forced UN shelters and services to shut, some for the first time since the war started over a year ago.\nDoctors Without Borders said that the assault was turning the area into an \"unliveable wasteland\".\nThis is the third incursion launched by Israeli forces on Jabalia since October 2023. In May, a 20-day assault from land and air laid the camp to waste.\nThe 'general\u2019s plan'\nThe renewed assault comes amid fears that the military is implementing a plan conceived by retired Major-General Giora Eiland to empty northern Gaza of its 400,000 residents to make way for a \"closed military zone\".\n\"The general's plan,\" which was launched in an Israeli TV campaign, calls for the ethnic cleansing of northern Gaza, warning that those that remain will face starvation.\n\"The right thing to do is to inform the approximately 300,000 residents who remained in the northern Gaza Strip\u2026 we are ordering you to leave,\" Eiland said last month.\n\"In a week, the entire territory of the northern Gaza Strip will become military territory.\"\nIn recent weeks, the plan was reportedly being considered by Israel's government, with Reuters reporting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said it \"makes sense\".\nIsrael's public broadcaster Kann reported that the renewed incursion on Jabalia could signal the implementation of the plan.\n\"The entire northern area of the Gaza Strip will be cleansed according to the generals' plan \u2013 the entire population will be evacuated\u2026and the entire northern area of the Gaza Strip will be declared a closed military area,\" the network reported on Saturday.\n'As long as there are patients, I won't leave'\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces issued expulsion orders for three main hospitals in northern Gaza - Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and the Indonesian hospital, giving them just 24 hours to flee.\nThe army threatened that if they didn't leave, they would face \"the same fate as al-Shifa hospital, with destruction, killing and arrest\u201d, according to a statement by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.\nThe enclave\u2019s health ministry reported that Israeli forces had besieged the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia, warning that it would imminently run out of fuel. It said that one paramedic was detained while accompanying a patient being removed, despite coordination efforts.\nThe hospital, which is the only remaining hospital in northern Gaza that specialises in maternity services and dialysis, is currently housing some 60 patients.\nAccording to Medical Aid for Palestine (MAP), staff at Kamal Adwan removed newborn patients from the neonatal unit but reported that ambulances were being stopped at Israeli checkpoints despite assurances of \"safe passage\" to another hospital by the Israeli military.\nThe hospital's director, Dr Hossam Abu Safia, told Drop Site News that he is refusing to flee.\n\"As long as there are patients, I won't leave,\" he said. \"I've been here since the genocide started, and I am determined to continue helping my people.\"\nNGO Action Aid said the organisation was \"gravely alarmed\" by the expulsion orders for the northern Gaza hospitals.\n\u201cThis impacts all patients, medical staff, critically ill individuals in intensive care, pregnant women, and newborns in incubators,\u201d it warned in a statement on X.\nMiddle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

        "content": "title: Dead children were no props \n content: \u201cTales of infanticide\u201d is not what is happening in Gaza (\u201cTales of infanticide have stoked hatred of Jews for centuries. They echo still today\u201d). These are real deaths and real children and real loss. The blood libel myth is a horrific example of how antisemitic propaganda was used to persecute, and eventually exile, the Jewish population of England. It is a shameful facet of British history but it is, and it is important that we strip its power by firmly establishing this, a myth. The killing and bombing and starving of Gaza children is not a myth. It is fact, it is continuing and it is irrevocably disrespectful to their memory and their families to suggest that their bodies are only a prop in an antisemitic narrative.\nWhat is antisemitic is to equate an entire religion with one violent regime and occupier, which is precisely what Jacobson does in this article. The Jewish population and faith is diverse and there are many who do not support the Gazan occupation and genocide.\nEsther Chauncy\nLondon E7\nAs a writer of fiction, Howard Jacobson is an excellent polemicist who in his article gives cover for Israel\u2019s war crimes against my people, and so risks stoking antisemitism. I will never defend antisemitic blood libel, although I will accuse Israel of habitually murdering Palestinian children.\nHere are some facts: Guardian reporter Chris McGreal wrote in April that doctors were \u201cdeeply troubled by the number of children who were severely wounded or killed by single gunshots\u201d from Israeli sniping. A group of 45 doctors sent a letter with accompanying documentary evidence attesting to this. My mother\u2019s cousin, 15-year-old Abdallah El-Farra, was shot like this while fetching bread for his family in July.\nAlso in April, the Guardian reported that Israel knowingly allows the killing of civilians with its AI-powered targeting methodology. In Nasser hospital, in November 2023, I watched as a grim procession consisting of a baby, three older children and two adults were carried to the morgue immediately after an Israeli airstrike on the Khan Younis refugee camp. Twenty-five of my maternal family, including children, were killed by an Israeli airstrike on their home in Khan Younis last week.\nWe accuse Israelis and their western arms dealers, not Jews, of murdering more children than in any other conflict in the past two decades. Jacobson should pause to consider facts and the impact of conflating Jewishness with Israel if he truly cares about antisemitism.\nMohamed Ghalaieny\nManchester\nI\u2019m positively charged\nRos Coward is right to ask for a more coherent and effective system of public EV charging (\u201cFour years after buying an electric car, why am I still forced to play hunt-the-charger?\u201d).\nNonetheless, my 18 months of EV ownership has left me feeling much more positive. For those of us able to charge at home it is a no-brainer. Aside from the heavy carbon footprint, internal combustion engines are woefully inefficient in energy use. At best, about a third of the energy in the fuel is used to propel the car \u2013 two-thirds is discarded as heat from the radiator and exhaust. Hybrids are better than conventional cars, but only marginally. Driven sensibly, our mid-sized EV has a range between 280 (winter) and 320 (summer) miles. It has taken us to west Wales and to south-west France. Long trips require a little forethought, but so does anything in life that is to be done effectively. \u201cRange anxiety\u201d feels suspiciously like a neurosis that is being promoted by lobbyists for the oil industry.\nDr John Gee\nForest Row, East Sussex\nLooking good, feeling good\nAt last, someone with common sense who realises that the reason people get surgery is simply to feel better about themselves (\u201cSocial media isn\u2019t driving the plastic surgery boom. Who doesn\u2019t want to look better?\u201d). I wish the sour grapes crowd would stop shaming those who simply want to feel better about themselves, instead of insinuating that anyone who cares about how they look is somehow a bad person.\nBekah Griffiths\nCobham, Surrey\nWhat about the climate?\nWill Hutton always has something important to say about politics and society. His new book is no different. But there is a flaw at its heart and he illustrates that in his piece (\u201cAfter 100 days of mistakes, we need to hear Labour\u2019s underlying philosophy\u201d). The world has changed and yet here we are again, 70 years back, picking the brains of a long-dead politician. The challenges we face are unprecedented and the elephant in the room is the climate and biodiversity crisis. No mention of that here and hardly any in his book, yet the looming failure to address it will negate all his vision. His plea to the new government is valid and heartfelt but the gap between that and the action we need, now, is a yawning chasm.\nNeil Blackshaw\nAlnwick, Northumberland\nHard work pays off\nTorsten Bell rightly highlights the role that inherited wealth plays in financial security, but strays too far into defeatism (\u201cTikTok is full of advice on how to retire early. The truth is you just need rich parents\u201d). Reducing success to luck of birth ignores the value of hard work, innovation and perseverance.\nSuggesting that financial success is unattainable without rich parents risks fostering resignation in young people. Yes, inherited wealth creates advantages, but it doesn\u2019t make ambition and effort futile. Social mobility stagnates when we promote a sense of helplessness. Instead, we should empower young people to believe that, despite the challenges, they can change their circumstances.\nWhile the system is rigged towards the wealthy, there are countless examples of people who have built success through smart choices and persistence. It may be harder today, but it\u2019s not impossible. The state has a role in levelling the playing field, but individuals must take charge of their own destiny.\nOmar Sarhan\nLeeds\nPut a brake on boozing\nRe \u201cEngland urged to bring in minimum unit price on alcohol as deaths rise 10% a year\u201d: prevention takes many forms in public health. The people who design seatbelts do not generally want to outlaw cars, but to reduce the deaths from crashes. Some people will drink a lot of alcohol, if it is readily available and relatively cheap. Damage to the body from alcohol relates to the amount consumed and how frequently. Alcohol-related deaths are at a high-water mark \u2013 and still rising. Our society does not encourage driving a car without brakes. A minimum unit price is effective, for some drinkers, in putting a brake on their boozing.\nWoody Caan\nDuxford, Cambridgeshire\nPortobello porkies\nIn his review of Boris Johnson\u2019s Unleashed, Tim Adams asks us to spare a thought for the factcheckers (New Review). He cites Johnson\u2019s claims that \u201cgraffiti appeared on the wall in Portobello Road\u201d, saying \u201cBrexit saves lives\u201d. As a resident of the road, I can confirm that is a fact. I can also confirm that beneath it, in the same handwriting, were the words \u201cBrexit keeps Britain white\u201d. I painted over it. That may be why Johnson failed to mention it in his memoir.\nJohn Lowery\nLondon W11",

        "content": "title: Forgotten generation: After one year of conflict, the IRC warns of the life-long impacts for Gaza\u2019s children \n content: Amman, Jordan, October 9, 2024 \u2014 In Gaza, an entire generation of children is now at risk of being \u2018forgotten\u2019. With the cumulative effects of unrelenting violence, forced displacement and loss of an entire school year likely to impact them for the rest of their lives. The time to act to provide relief and scale-up humanitarian aid is now, to protect children and ensure their recovery.\nOne year has passed since the latest escalation of conflict in Gaza, and nearly every facet of civilian life in Gaza has been destroyed. Israeli forces began a deadly campaign of airstrikes and ground invasions, killing more than 41,000 people, following an attack on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups, that killed 1,200 people and the taking of over 200 hostages.\nThe conflict has left the entire population in Gaza in crisis, without access to basic necessities such as adequate food, water, shelter, education and healthcare. Half of those affected are children.\nNo safe spaces for children\nAmong the most vulnerable groups of children are unaccompanied and separated children. It is estimated that around 17,000 children could be unaccompanied or separated from parents and caregivers, but based on previous experience of other crises, IRC believes this number may be three times higher. IRC research has found that the risk family separation has increased dramatically in the past months, exacerbated by multiple rounds of displacements, arrests, Israeli evacuation orders and fatalities, with some children found living alone in hospitals.\nEven before the latest escalation, at least half a million children in Gaza needed mental health and psychosocial support. Now, the burden of witnessing profoundly distressing events, multiple displacements and lack of safety means that every child, parent and caregiver in Gaza is experiencing trauma, which could require long-term mental health and psycho-social support.\nOngoing toxic stress from violence and displacement will lead to long-term health challenges for children. There are currently no safe places for civilians in Gaza, and children feel the negative impacts most acutely. There is an urgent need for support for children through psychosocial activities or safe spaces. Without this, there is a significant risk of long-term developmental impacts, including on brain development. The situation urgently calls for immediate international support and intervention to mitigate these long-term impacts and support the resilience and recovery of an entire generation of Palestinian children.\nFaten Abu Mousa, IRC\u2019s Child Protection Manager in Gaza, says:\n\u201cIn Gaza, children are the most vulnerable group, and their basic needs, especially their sense of safety, have become non-existent. At IRC, we have been working with our community facilitators to give children a helping hand by creating safe spaces for expression and communication and providing mental health and psycho-social support services, and we feel how much this support means to children every day, all of whom have profound trauma. These interventions help restore a sense of security, provide coping mechanisms, and enhance emotional resilience. Engaging children in mental health and psychosocial support activities during crises not only strengthens resilience, but also enables them to rebuild their lives, creating a foundation for healing and hope.\u201d\nMalnutrition crisis\nGaza is now facing an unprecedented food crisis with the entire population of 2.2 million people facing crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity\u2014the highest share ever classified for any area or country. Even prior to this crisis, chronic malnutrition was already an issue in Gaza, meaning that with an influx of new cases of acute malnutrition IRC teams in Gaza are seeing increased rates of severe and acute malnutrition in children under five. While humanitarian partners are able to treat cases in the Israeli-designated \u201csafe zone\u201d, humanitarian operations to treat children in the north are severely restricted due to prevention of access and hostilities.\nEven if a child survives acute malnutrition, they will often face long-term health impacts, and require lifelong support. Prolonged malnutrition can negatively impact physical and mental development, including stunting, when a person\u2019s growth and cognitive development may be held back for their age. Acute malnutrition leads to wasting; where muscles rapidly deteriorate leading to a life-threatening situation. It is very common for a child to experience both stunting and wasting at the same time. In these cases, the child's risk of death is more than 11 times higher than that of a healthy child especially because their weakened bodies are not able to fight off common diseases. Children under five are particularly at risk as they are in a critical period of growth.\nEducation disrupted\nChildren in Gaza have now missed one year of education due to the destruction of school buildings and the collapse of the education system. Reports suggest that the impact of war and trauma will set Gazan children\u2019s education back by up to five years. The absence of schooling for more than a year means that children are not just behind developmentally, but they have also lost access to safe spaces that schools would have previously provided.\nWhile ensuring physical safety, preventing starvation, and providing life-saving medical attention are the most immediate and urgent needs in Gaza, the consequences of repeated exposure to violence, upheaval and a breakdown in education and early developmental supportive services are devastating. Severe and prolonged stress and trauma in the first years of life can have profoundly detrimental effects on children\u2019s future health, learning and overall wellbeing, as well as threatening to cause lasting impacts for future generations of Palestinians.\nBart Witteveen, IRC Country Director for the occupied Palestinian territory, says: \u201cChildren are bearing the brunt of this war, and it\u2019s clear that without an immediate and lasting ceasefire in sight, the long-term impacts will only become greater. Prolonged toxic stress from violence and displacement can lead to long-term health challenges for children. Without support through psychosocial activities or safe spaces for children, there is a significant risk of long-term developmental impacts, including on brain development. The international community must act immediately to safeguard children, not just in the immediate term, but also taking into account their long-term health needs, whether related to mental health, healthcare or education. Children in Gaza cannot wait any longer, prolonged restrictions on humanitarian aid and continued fighting means that a generation of children will now experience life-long health and developmental issues.\u201d\nIn light of the desperate need for a massive scale-up in humanitarian aid and the need to prioritise responding to the acute needs of children, the IRC continues to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire as the only way to protect Palestinian lives and enable the release of the remaining hostages.\nMedia contacts\nIRC Global Communications\n+1 646 761 0307\ncommunications@rescue.org",

        "content": "title: Ms. Lisa Doughten, Director of Financing and Partnerships Division, OCHA, on behalf of Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Ms. Joyce Msuya - Briefing to the Security Council on Gaza, 9 October 2024 - occupied Palestinian territory | ReliefWeb \n content: New York, 9 October 2024\nAs delivered\nMadam President, Members of the Security Council,\nThank you for this opportunity to update you on the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory \u2013 both Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe past year has brought unimaginable suffering. It has been one year since the horrendous attack by Hamas and other armed groups in Israel. And rockets continue to be fired indiscriminately into Israel.\nFew times in recent history have we witnessed suffering and destruction of the size, scale, and scope that we see in Gaza. In the past year, this Council has been briefed repeatedly on the horror unfolding in Gaza, at least monthly on average.\nOnce again, we find ourselves at a critical juncture. Unfortunately, much of what I am about to say mirrors what we reported a month ago. Widespread suffering persists while the humanitarian situation worsens.\nThe recent evacuation orders by Israeli authorities for large areas of northern Gaza, along with intensified ground operations, risk more death, destruction and yet another mass displacement of civilians.\nOnce again, utter chaos ensues as the world watches on.\nBefore we turn to the situation, we express, deep concern about the ongoing legislation to stop the activities of UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency]. This would be disastrous for the provision of aid and essential services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\nNearly every one of the more than 2 million people in Gaza receives some form of aid or service provision from UNRWA, along with nearly one million Palestine refugees in the West Bank. If approved, such legislation would diametrically be opposed to the UN Charter and in violation of Israel\u2019s obligations under international law.\nMadam President,\nOver the past year, relentless Israeli-issued displacement orders have affected almost 84 per cent of Gaza\u2019s territory. Around 90 percent of Gaza\u2019s population is internally displaced.\nHundreds of thousands of people are pressured to move south to Al Mawasi, but southern Gaza cannot accommodate more people.\nIn Al Mawasi \u2013 where civilians were told to go \u201312 Palestinians were reportedly killed and at least 26 others injured when two tents were struck in the camp at Al Mawasi on 1 October.\nEvacuation orders are meant to protect civilians, but the exact opposite is happening. As we have said so many times, there is no safe place in Gaza.\nThree of the ten partially functional hospitals in the north have been ordered to evacuate all patients without providing alternatives for relocating them. We have not been able to get fuel to other hospitals in the north.\nThere has been no electricity since October last year. Without electricity, or fuel for the generators, everything shuts down: medical facilities, water, sanitation, and other essential services.\nAnd bakeries are closing, deepening the already high levels of food insecurity.\nAs this conflict persists, civilians must have the essentials for their survival. They must be allowed to seek protection. Those displaced must be guaranteed the right to voluntarily return.\nMadam President,\nSevere impediments on the entry of essential commercial supplies and humanitarian access continue.\nFor instance, in September, humanitarian workers spent a total of 212 hours \u2013 that\u2019s nearly 9 days\u2019 worth of waiting -- to receive a green light from Israeli authorities to undertake life-saving missions.\nAnd in the past week, there have been no humanitarian movements to the north, while both land crossings have been closed for supplies entering Zikim and Erez.\nThe north of Gaza has been cut off, putting at risk the second round of the polio vaccination campaign, scheduled for mid-October.\nFurther, essential commercial supplies entering Gaza have drastically reduced in the past week.\nIn recent days, on average 50 truckloads of goods enter each day\u2013 quantities that do not begin to meet needs. Humanitarian assistance cannot be a substitute for the flow of commercial goods; and vice-versa.\nAid workers are only able to deliver a trickle of humanitarian aid through Israeli checkpoints.\nThese are life threatening restrictions.\nPeople are traumatized, hungry, digging with their bare hands in rubble for their loved ones.\nThey are increasingly frustrated about the international community\u2019s failure to stop the hostilities. And, as the situation worsens, this anger is increasingly being directed at humanitarian workers.\nThe lack of adequate humanitarian access means that food insecurity and diseases are spreading fast.\nThe severe lack of shelter supplies is likely to worsen health conditions and further undermine the dignity of vulnerable populations, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions, this coming winter.\nHumanitarian partners report that women and children are hard-hit by the trauma of this war.\nEach day, according to UNRWA,10 children are losing one or both of their legs. Gaza is home to the largest cohort of child amputees in modern history. Women are three times more likely to miscarry, and three times more likely to die from childbirth.\nAnd, yet humanitarians are not giving up.\nMadam President,\nWe also remain deeply concerned about the worsening situation in the West Bank.\nOver the past year, Israeli military operations, along with rampant settler violence and house demolitions, have led to a sharp rise in fatalities, widespread destruction and forced displacement.\nJust last week, on 4 October, 18 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed in an airstrike on a residential building in Tulkarm refugee camp; this was the single deadliest incident carried out by Israeli forces in the West Bank since OCHA began systematically documenting casualties in 2005.\nIn the West Bank, the use of lethal force must comply with international human rights law and the standards governing law enforcement. Tactics typically used during hostilities in armed conflict raise concerns about the excessive use of force.\nWe urge full respect for international law and compliance with the determinations of the International Court of Justice.\nMaximum influence must be exerted to alleviate the suffering of civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\nWe cannot claim ignorance to what is happening\u2014nor can we afford to look away.\nThat is why we repeat our calls for the Security Council, and Member States, to take action.\nThis includes ensuring respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law by exerting necessary pressure and cooperating in pursuing accountability for international crimes.\nThis means ensuring that all hostages are released.\nThis means ensuring civilians are protected, and their essential needs for survival met, wherever they are, whether they evacuate or not.\nThis means ensuring that humanitarian operations are protected and facilitated, including in accordance with the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice, for all civilians in need.\nUrgent diplomatic efforts are needed to de-escalate the situation in the Occupied Palestinian\nTerritory and to prevent a wider regional descent into bloodshed.\nMember States must take steps to achieve an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and a path towards sustainable peace.\nThese atrocities must end.\nThank you.\nDisclaimer\n- UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n- To learn more about OCHA's activities, please visit https://www.unocha.org/.",

If\n---\napproved, such legislation would diametrically be opposed to the UN Charter and in violation of Israel\u2019s obligations under international law. Madam President, Over the past year, relentless Israeli-issued displacement orders have affected almost 84 per cent of Gaza\u2019s territory. Around 90 per cent of Gaza\u2019s population is internally displaced. Hundreds of thousands of people are pressured to move south to Al Mawasi, but southern Gaza cannot accommodate more people. In Al Mawasi \u2013 where civilians were told to go \u2013 12 Palestinians were reportedly killed and at least 26 others injured when two tents were struck in the camp at Al Mawasi on 1 October. Evacuation orders are meant to protect civilians, but the exact opposite is happening. As we have said so many times, there is no safe place in Gaza. Three of the 10 partially functional hospitals in the north have been ordered to evacuate all patients without providing alternatives for relocating them. We have not been able to get fuel to other hospitals in the north. There has been no electricity since October last year. Without electricity, or fuel for the generators, everything shuts down: medical facilities, water, sanitation and other essential services. And bakeries are closing, deepening the already high levels of food insecurity. As this conflict persists, civilians must have the essentials for their survival. They must be allowed to seek protection. Those displaced must be guaranteed the right to voluntarily return. Madam President, Severe impediments on the entry of essential commercial supplies and humanitarian access continue. For instance, in September, humanitarian workers spent a total of 212 hours \u2013 that\u2019s nearly nine days\u2019 worth of waiting \u2013 to receive a green light from Israeli authorities to undertake life-saving missions. And in the past week, there have been no humanitarian movements to the north, while both land crossings have been closed for supplies entering Zikim and Erez. The north of Gaza has been cut off, putting at risk the second round of the polio vaccination campaign, scheduled for mid-October. Further, essential commercial supplies entering Gaza have drastically reduced in the past week.\n---\nIn recent days, on average 50 truckloads of goods enter each day \u2013 quantities that do not begin to meet needs. Humanitarian assistance cannot be a substitute for the flow of commercial goods; and vice versa.\n\nAid workers are only able to deliver a trickle of humanitarian aid through Israeli checkpoints. These are life-threatening restrictions. People are traumatized, hungry, digging with their bare hands in rubble for their loved ones.\n\nThey are increasingly frustrated about the international community\u2019s failure to stop the hostilities. And, as the situation worsens, this anger is increasingly being directed at humanitarian workers.\n\nThe lack of adequate humanitarian access means that food insecurity and diseases are spreading fast.\n\nThe severe lack of shelter supplies is likely to worsen health conditions and further undermine the dignity of vulnerable populations, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions, this coming winter.\n\nHumanitarian partners report that women and children are hard hit by the trauma of this war.\n\nEach day, according to UNRWA, 10 children are losing one or both of their legs. Gaza is home to the largest cohort of child amputees in modern history. Women are three times more likely to miscarry, and three times more likely to die from childbirth.\n\nAnd yet, humanitarians are not giving up.\n\nMadam President, We also remain deeply concerned about the worsening situation in the West Bank.\n\nOver the past year, Israeli military operations, along with rampant settler violence and house demolitions, have led to a sharp rise in fatalities, widespread destruction and forced displacement.\n\nJust last week, on 4 October, 18 Palestinians, including women and children, were killed in an airstrike on a residential building in Tulkarm refugee camp; this was the single deadliest incident carried out by Israeli forces in the West Bank since OCHA began systematically documenting casualties in 2005.\n\nIn the West Bank, the use of lethal force must comply with international human rights law and the standards governing law enforcement. Tactics typically used during hostilities in armed conflict raise concerns about the excessive use of force.\n---\nWe urge full respect for international law and compliance with the determinations of the International Court of Justice. Maximum influence must be exerted to alleviate the suffering of civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. We cannot claim ignorance to what is happening \u2013 nor can we afford to look away. That is why we repeat our calls for the Security Council, and Member States, to take action. This includes ensuring respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law by exerting necessary pressure and cooperating in pursuing accountability for international crimes. This means ensuring that all hostages are released. This means ensuring civilians are protected, and their essential needs for survival met, wherever they are, whether they evacuate or not. This means ensuring that humanitarian operations are protected and facilitated, including in accordance with the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice, for all civilians in need. Urgent diplomatic efforts are needed to de-escalate the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and to prevent a wider regional descent into bloodshed. Member States must take steps to achieve an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and a path towards sustainable peace. These atrocities must end. Thank you.",

        "content": "title: After a year of catastrophic failure, the international community must act urgently to protect Palestinian survival in Gaza \n content: As Gaza marks one-year of Israel\u2019s military assault and siege, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) demands meaningful action to enforce a ceasefire, uphold international law, and protect Palestinians from potential genocide.\nA year of Israel\u2019s indiscriminate bombardment has resulted in death and destruction on a previously-unthinkable scale in Gaza. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, and the more than 96,000 injured have entered an overwhelmed and systematically dismantled health system that cannot adequately care for them.\n986 health workers have been killed according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health \u2013 a number unprecedented in any other conflict in recent years \u2013 and those who survive are exhausted, having worked non-stop for 365 days of attacks and airstrikes.\nThe Israeli military\u2019s siege and obstruction of humanitarian aid operations have strangled access to electricity, food, water, medicine and fuel, and destroyed almost 70% of all buildings in Gaza. Many families now lack the basic necessities for life including safe drinking water, adequate food and hygiene materials. The humanitarian system has all but collapsed and infectious diseases, including polio, are spreading fast.\nOne year into these horrors in Gaza, Israel has also intensified indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks in the occupied West Bank and Lebanon, killing and injuring thousands more people. The region now continues to spiral towards all-out war, putting countless more civilians in harm\u2019s way.\nMore than nine months ago, the International Court of Justice ordered provisional measures to prevent a potential genocide in Gaza. These measures remain ignored, and the international community has failed to bring about a permanent ceasefire, enforce international law or ensure the unimpeded delivery of aid to people in Gaza.\nIsrael\u2019s attacks represent an existential threat to the communities MAP serves across the region. We therefore implore world leaders to end Israel\u2019s war on Palestinians before it is too late.\nFikr Shalltoot, MAP\u2019s Gaza Director, said: \u201cWe have run out of words to describe the horrors our teams are witnessing and experiencing in Gaza. Frequent mass killings of civilians, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and the systematic destruction of healthcare are an existential threat to people. Gaza is being erased in front of our eyes.\u201d\nRohan Talbot, MAP\u2019s Director of Advocacy and Campaigns, said: \u201cWe need a ceasefire now, a suspension of arms transfers to Israel and unobstructed delivery of humanitarian aid. We need all of this to stop a potential genocide and protect Palestinian survival in Gaza and, increasingly, across the region.\u201d\nSince October 2023, enabled by and unprecedented outpouring of solidarity and support from people around the world, MAP\u2019s local team in Gaza have been responding to this emergency, while themselves trying simply to survive. Their tireless work has meant that more than 560,000 people have benefitted from MAP\u2019s relief efforts. This includes essential medicines, medical equipment, food and shelter items. MAP has also sent 10 emergency medical teams of international doctors to Gaza, to support local health workers treating injuries.\nMohammed Aghaalkurdi, MAP\u2019s Medical Programme Lead said: \u201cThe health situation in Gaza remains dire following a full year of the deadliest Israeli military attacks I can ever recall. We Palestinians deserve a better future and better lives. We deserve freedom. It starts with a ceasefire, nothing less than that. It will take many decades to rebuild Gaza and our lives here, so we must be able to start now.\u201d\nSondos Alashqar, MAP\u2019s Programme Assistant in Gaza, said: \u201cThere is no single word that can describe the past year. Who could have imagined that in this era of rapidly advancing technology, world leaders would remain silent, witnessing constant Israeli military attacks and the displacement of so many people now living in tents, yet saying nothing?\u201d\n\u201cThe past year has been a period of immense hardship for the people of Gaza, with constant challenges in accessing basic needs, healthcare and education, and rebuilding efforts amid ongoing instability. Yet, despite the crisis, the steadfastness of the local community continues to shine\u201d.\nMAP\u2019s emergency response has now extended to the West Bank and Lebanon where we are also supporting medical services amid a significant escalation of Israeli military attacks which are affecting Palestinian communities.\n---\nMAP has received more than \u00a360m in donations from supporters in over 160 countries. We are very grateful for the massive care and solidarity being shown to MAP colleagues in Gaza and the communities we serve in this time of unprecedented crisis.\nENDS\nNotes to editors:\nQuotes from MAP staff and humanitarian workers:\nMohammed Aghaalkurdi, Medical Programme Lead in Gaza - MAP, he said:\n\u201cOne moment that has stuck with me was when there were families who were sheltering in the hospital and in the ICU. I saw a particular family who were tearful and were asking if they could see their 10-year-old son, who had been admitted to the ICU unresponsive and intubated. They were evacuating the hospital, and they knew the Israeli military had a plan for this hospital and that they might never see their child again. They wanted to bid goodbye to him as they knew that the medical care might have to be stopped when the electricity was cut, and he might die, meaning they would never see him again. This was one of the hardest moments I I have ever experienced in my entire life.\u201d\nLiz Allcock, Head of Protection - MAP. She was working in Gaza in July, August and September 2024. She said:\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many compounding horrors as I\u2019ve seen in Gaza. It\u2019s not just poor living conditions, it\u2019s also the constant threat to life, the repeated forced displacement, the constant siege, and the list goes on. People are trying to survive in places that have been totally decimated by the Israeli military.\u201d\nDr Ammar Darwish, volunteer surgeon in a MAP / IRC organised emergency medical team that travelled to Gaza from 13 August - 10 September 2024. Working at Nasser Hospital. He said:\n\u201cAt Nasser Hospital we were having to operate without any equipment like sterile gowns or abdominal packs which are key for trauma surgeries. Without these we cannot operate appropriately. There is a shortage of all supplies, including medical supplies, and medicines, which made our work unbelievably challenging and resulted in sometimes deadly outcomes for patients. It was extremely difficult and heartbreaking.\nI can't really believe that the world is turning a blind eye and turning away from what's happening in Gaza. An immediate ceasefire is an absolute necessity\u201d.\nContact:\nFor media inquiries or interviews, additional quotes or testimony, please reply to this email or contact:\nEmail: press@map.org.uk Phone: +44 (0)203 869 1310\nAbout Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP)\nMAP, which has existed for 40 years, works for a future where every Palestinian has access to a comprehensive, effective and locally-led system of healthcare, and the full realisation of their rights to health and dignity.Our team in Gaza were among the first to respond to the current emergency and remain one of the only international organisations working to provide humanitarian and medical services, including in the north.\nWhile our emergency response is mainly focused on Gaza, we are also supporting medical services in the occupied West Bank, amid a significant escalation of Israeli military and settler violence against Palestinians, and supporting the healthcare needs of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.\nFor more information please visit: www.map.org.uk",

        "content": "title: UN Commission finds war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israeli attacks on Gaza health facilities and treatment of detainees, hostages [EN/AR/HE] - occupied Palestinian territory | ReliefWeb \n content: GENEVA (10 October 2024) \u2013 Israel has perpetrated a concerted policy to destroy Gaza\u2019s healthcare system as part of a broader assault on Gaza, committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination with relentless and deliberate attacks on medical personnel and facilities, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel said in a new report today.\nThe Commission also investigated the treatment of Palestinian detainees in Israel and of Israeli and foreign hostages in Gaza since 7 October 2023, and concluded that Israel and Palestinian armed groups are responsible for torture and sexual and gender-based violence.\n\u201cIsrael must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction of healthcare facilities in Gaza,\u201d said Navi Pillay, Chair of the Commission. \u201cBy targeting healthcare facilities, Israel is targeting the right to health itself with significant long-term detrimental effects on the civilian population. Children in particular have borne the brunt of these attacks, suffering both directly and indirectly from the collapse of the health system.\u201d\nThe report found that Israeli security forces have deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel and targeted medical vehicles while tightening their siege on Gaza and restricting permits to leave the territory for medical treatment. These actions constitute the war crimes of wilful killing and mistreatment and of the destruction of protected civilian property and the crime against humanity of extermination.\nAttacks on medical facilities in Gaza, particularly those devoted to paediatric and neonatal care, have led to incalculable suffering of child patients, including newborns, the report said. In continuing these attacks, Israel has violated children\u2019s right to life, denied children access to basic healthcare, and deliberately inflicted conditions of life resulting in the destruction of generations of Palestinian children and, potentially, the Palestinian people as a group.\nIn one of the most egregious cases, the Commission investigated the killing of five-year-old Hind Rajab, along with her extended family, and the shelling of a Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulance and killing of two paramedics sent to rescue her. The Commission determined on reasonable grounds that the Israeli Army\u2019s 162nd Division operated in the area and is responsible for killing the family of seven, shelling the ambulance and killing the two paramedics inside. This constitutes the war crimes of wilful killing and an attack against civilian objects.\nThe deliberate destruction of health infrastructure providing sexual and reproductive healthcare, combined with the lack of access and availability to healthcare, is also a violation of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 reproductive rights and their right to life, health, human dignity and non-discrimination, as well as the crime against humanity of other inhumane acts.\nRegarding the detention of Palestinians in Israeli military camps and detention facilities, the report found that thousands of child and adult detainees, many of whom were arbitrarily detained, have been subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence. Male detainees were subjected to rape, as well as attacks on their sexual and reproductive organs and forced to perform humiliating and strenuous acts while naked or stripped as a form of punishment or intimidation to extract information. The deaths of detainees as a result of abuse or neglect amount to the war crimes of wilful killing or murder and violations of the right to life.\nChild detainees released by Israeli authorities have returned to Gaza severely traumatized, unaccompanied, with limited ability to locate or communicate with their families.\nThe report found that the institutionalized mistreatment of Palestinian detainees, a longstanding characteristic of the occupation, took place under direct orders from the Israeli Minister in charge of the prison system, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and was fuelled by Israeli government statements inciting violence and retribution.\n\u201cThe appalling acts of abuse committed against Palestinian detainees require accountability and reparations for the victims,\u201d said Pillay. \u201cThe lack of accountability for actions ordered by senior Israeli authorities and carried out by individual members of Israeli security forces and the increasing acceptance of violence against Palestinians have allowed such conduct to continue uninterrupted, becoming systematic and institutionalized.\u201d\nRegarding the Israeli and foreign hostages held in Gaza by Palestinian armed groups, the report found that many were mistreated to inflict physical pain and severe mental suffering, including physical violence, abuse, sexual violence, forced isolation, limited access to hygiene facilities, water and food, threats and humiliation. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups forced hostages to participate in videos with the intent of inflicting psychological torture on the families of hostages, to achieve political aims. Several hostages were killed in captivity. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups committed the war crimes of torture, inhuman or cruel treatment, and the crimes against humanity of enforced disappearance and other inhumane acts causing great suffering or serious injury.\n\u201cPalestinian armed groups must release immediately and unconditionally all Israeli and foreign hostages held in Gaza. Hostages must be treated in accordance with the requirements of international humanitarian law and international human rights law until they are released,\u201d said Pillay.\nThe Commission urges Israel\u2019s Government to immediately cease targeting medical facilities, staff and vehicles, halt the arbitrary and unlawful detention of Palestinians, including children, and end torture and other ill-treatment of all those who have been arrested or detained.\nThe Commission calls on the Government of the State of Palestine and the de-facto authorities in Gaza to ensure the protection and safe release of all hostages immediately and unconditionally, and thoroughly and impartially investigate and prosecute violations of international law, including the targeting of medical facilities in Israel.\nAddressing the conflict\u2019s root causes, the Commission urges the Government of Israel to comply with the directions of the July 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice to end the unlawful occupation of Palestinian territory, cease new settlement plans and activities, evacuate all settlers and make reparations to victims. It also calls on Israel to comply with provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of Article II(a)-(d) of the Genocide Convention.\nThe Commission\u2019s report will be presented to the General Assembly\u2019s 79th session on 30 October 2024 in New York.\nBackground: The UN Human Rights Council mandated the Commission on 27 May 2021 to \u201cinvestigate, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel, all alleged violations of international humanitarian law and all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law leading up to and since 13 April 2021.\u201d Resolution A/HRC/RES/S-30/1 further requested the commission of inquiry to \u201cinvestigate all underlying root causes of recurrent tensions, instability and protraction of conflict, including systematic discrimination and repression based on national, ethnic, racial or religious identity.\u201d The Commission of Inquiry was mandated to report to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly annually commencing from June 2022 and September 2022, respectively.\nMore information on the work of the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, can be found here.\nFor more information and media requests, please contact: Todd Pitman, Media Adviser for the Human Rights Council\u2019s Investigative Missions, at todd.pitman@un.org, or Pascal Sim, Human Rights Council Media Officer, at simp@un.org.",

        "content": "title: Israeli attack on northern Gaza hints at retired general's \"surrender or starve\" plan for war \n content: Israeli attack on northern Gaza hints at retired general's 'surrender or starve' plan for war\nOn Saturday morning, a message was posted on social media by the Israeli military\u2019s Arabic spokesman warning people living in the \u2018D5\u2019 area of northern Gaza to move south. D5 is a square on the grid superimposed over maps of Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It is a block that is split into several dozen smaller areas.\nThe message, the latest in a series, said: \"The IDF is operating with great force against the terrorist organisations and will continue to do so for a long time. The designated area, including the shelters located there, is considered a dangerous combat zone. The area must be evacuated immediately via Salah al-Din Road to the humanitarian area.\"\nA map is attached with a large yellow arrow pointing from block D5 down to the south of Gaza. Salah al-Din Road is the main north-south route. The message is not promising a swift return to the places people have been living in, an area that has been pulverised by a year of repeated Israeli attacks. The heart of the message is that the IDF will be using \"great force\u2026 for a long time\". In other words, don\u2019t expect to come back any time soon.\nThe humanitarian area designated by Israel in the message is al-Mawasi, previously an agricultural area on the coast near Rafah. It is overcrowded and no safer than many other parts of Gaza. BBC Verify has tracked at least 18 airstrikes on the area.\nHamas has sent out its own messages to the 400,000 people left in northern Gaza, an area that was once the urban heartland of the Strip with a population of 1.4m. Hamas is telling them not to move. The south, they are told, is just as dangerous. As well as that, Hamas is warning them that they will not be allowed back.\nMany people appear to be staying put, despite Israeli airstrikes and artillery bombardments. When I went down to an area overlooking northern Gaza I could hear explosions and see columns of smoke rising. The intensity reminded me of the first months of the war.\nSome of the people who have stayed in northern Gaza when so many others have already fled south are doing so to remain with vulnerable relatives. Others are from families with connections to Hamas. Under the laws of war, that does not automatically make them belligerents.\nOne tactic that has been used over the last year by civilians who want to avoid IDF operations without taking their chances in the overcrowded and dangerous south of Gaza is to move elsewhere in the north, for example from Beit Hanoun to Gaza City, while the IDF is operating near their homes or shelters. When the army moves on, they return.\nThe IDF is trying to stop that happening, according to BBC colleagues who are daily contact with Palestinians in Gaza. It is channelling families who are moving in one direction only, down Salah al-Din, the main road to the south.\nIsrael does not allow journalists to enter Gaza to report the war, except for brief, rare and closely supervised trips with the IDF. Palestinian journalists who were there on 7 October still do brave work. The Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 128 Palestinian media workers in Gaza have been killed since the war began. In northern Gaza, since Israel went back on the offensive, they have been filming panic-stricken families as they flee, often with small children helping out by carrying oversized backpacks.\nOne of them sent out a brief interview with a woman called Manar al-Bayar who was rushing down the street carrying a toddler. She was saying as she half-walked, half-ran on the way out of Jabalia refugee camp that \"they told us we had five minutes to leave the Fallujah school. Where do we go? In southern Gaza there are assassinations. In western Gaza they\u2019re shelling people. Where do we go, oh God? God is our only chance.\u201d\nThe journey is hard. Sometimes, Palestinians in Gaza say, people on the move are fired on by the IDF. It insists that Israeli soldiers observe strict rules of engagement that respect international humanitarian law.\nBut Medical Aid for Palestinians\u2019 head of protection, Liz Allcock, says the evidence presented by wounded civilians suggest that they have been targeted.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re receiving patients in hospitals, a large number of those women and children and people of, if you like, non-combatant age are receiving direct shots to the head, to the spine, to the limbs, very indicative of the direct targeted attack.\u201d\nOnce again, the UN and aid agencies who work in Gaza are saying that Israeli military pressure is deepening what is already a humanitarian catastrophe.\nDesperate messages are being relayed from the remaining hospitals in northern Gaza, saying that they are running low on fuel to power the generators that keep the hospitals going, and keep badly wounded patients alive. Some hospitals report that their buildings have been attacked by the Israelis.\nThe suspicion among Palestinians, the UN and relief agencies is that the IDF is gradually adopting some or all of a new tactic to clear northern Gaza known as the \"Generals\u2019 Plan\". It was proposed by a group of retired senior officers led by Maj-Gen (ret) Giora Eiland, who is a former national security adviser.\nLike most Israelis they are frustrated and angry that a year into the war Israel still has not achieved its war aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. The Generals\u2019 Plan is a new idea that its instigators believe can, from Israel\u2019s perspective, break the deadlock.\nAt its heart is the idea that Israel can force the surrender of Hamas and its leader Yahya Sinwar by increasing the pressure on the entire population of the north. The first step is to order civilians to leave along evacuation corridors that will take them south of Wadi Gaza, an east-west stream that has become a dividing line in Gaza since the Israeli invasion last October.\nGiora Eiland believes Israel should have done a deal straight away to get the hostages back, even if it meant pulling out of Gaza entirely. A year later, other methods, he says, are necessary.\nIn his office in central Israel, he laid out the heart of the plan.\n\u201cSince we already encircled the northern part of Gaza in the past nine or 10 months, what we should do is the following thing to tell all the 300,000 residents [that the UN estimates is 400,000] who still live in the northern part of Gaza that they have to leave this area and they should be given 10 days to leave through safe corridors that Israel will provide.\n\"And after that time, all this area will become to be a military zone. And all the Hamas people will still, though, whether some of them are fighters, some of them are civilians\u2026 will have two choices either to surrender or to starve.\"\nEiland wants Israel to seal the areas once the evacuation corridors are closed. Anyone left behind would be treated as an enemy combatant. The area would be under siege, with the army blocking all supplies of food, water or other necessities of life from going in. He believes the pressure would become unbearable and what is left of Hamas would rapidly crumble, freeing the surviving hostages and giving Israel the victory it craves.\nThe UN World Food Programme says that the current offensive in Gaza is having a \"disastrous impact on food security for thousands of Palestinian families\". The main crossings into northern Gaza, it says, have been closed and no food aid has entered the strip since 1 October. Mobile kitchens and bakeries have been forced to stop work because of air strikes. The only functioning bakery in the north, which is supported by WFP, caught fire after it was hit by an explosive munition. The position in the south is almost as dire.\nIt is not clear whether the IDF has adopted the Generals' Plan in part or in full, but the circumstantial evidence of what is being done in Gaza suggests it is at the very least a strong influence on the tactics being used against the population. The BBC submitted a list of questions to the IDF, which were not answered.\nThe ultra-nationalist extremists in Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet want to replace Palestinians in northern Gaza with Jewish settlers. Among many statements he\u2019s made on the subject, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said \u201cOur heroic fighters and soldiers are destroying the evil of Hamas, and we will occupy the Gaza Strip\u2026 to tell the truth, where there is no settlement, there is no security.\u201d",

A ceasefire would mean that the civilians, including children, who are killed today would still be alive tomorrow. Without a ceasefire, more lives will be lost, and people will continue living in fear.\n\"I'm willing to pay any price just to hug my child\"\nDr. Ahmed Abu Warda, MSF medical activities manager\nTo be honest, a ceasefire has become a dream for us. It means a lot of things. It means that I could see my son, who I haven't seen for seven months. He left Gaza for Egypt when he was 14 months old. Everything in his life changed during this period. I missed out on him growing up, from his first steps to the first words he spoke, his choices, his games\u2014so many things in his life. For me, it has become a dream to see my son with my wife during this period. My wife has a big burden as she has she played the role of a mother and a father at the same time, because she wanted to make up for my absence in her life during this period.\nMy biggest nightmare is, will my son forget me as his father? I talk about this with my wife. She reminds him of me and we talk to each other. We make video calls and try to show him that life is normal even though life is far from normal.\nThe things that we are losing now are irreplaceable. I know that every step or every change in my son's life during this period is irreplaceable. These things are gone forever and will not happen again.\nDr. Ahmed Abu Warda, MSF medical activities manager\nThe things that we are losing now are irreplaceable. I know that every step or every change in my son's life during this period is irreplaceable. These things are gone forever and will not happen again. They happen once in life. Because of the war, I missed out on all the monumental things I was deprived of, like seeing my family regularly\u2014my father, my mother, and my brothers, who are currently living in one area.\nFor us, a ceasefire has become a dream.\n\"I hope to be reunited with my fianc\u00e9\"\nDr. Haya Hashem Salman, MSF doctor at MSF\u2019s field hospital in Deir al-Balah\nA ceasefire is a dream for me. It means a lot to me but I feel it is becoming more impossible.\nThe most important thing [would be] feeling security and stability. Because every day, especially in our job as doctors, we have to go out for long periods of time when we leave home, and we don't know if we will return home or not. Even during long, busy shifts, I keep up with the news. You fear something might happen near your family when you're not there and regret not being there to help.\nI always have this feeling of fear. The sense of stability fades with new evacuation orders every day; we have to collect all our stuff after settling in a certain place, we have to move to another place. Repeated displacement ... nearly 100 times. So we have lost that feeling of stability. Maybe this is the most important thing we all need.\nWe will try to continue our lives on the rubble of the past. Even if it's not the way we imagined it before.\nDr. Haya Hashem Salman, MSF doctor at MSF\u2019s field hospital in Deir al-Balah\nBut a ceasefire will not bring back the people we have lost.\nThree months before the war I got engaged and I was preparing for the wedding. I was happy with all the details of preparing the wedding. Of course, after October 7, I won't be able to do what I dreamed of. But at least I hope to be reunited with my fianc\u00e9, because he stayed in the north, and I came to the south. Maybe the thing I wish for most is to see him again.\nA ceasefire has been our long-awaited hope for more than a year. It would mean that I can sleep without thinking that the house might collapse on me or that I might wake up and find myself buried under rubble. A ceasefire would mean I can go to work feeling relaxed and reassured that my children are safe, that I can walk in the street without fear ... A ceasefire is what we\u2019ve been waiting for over a year. A ceasefire would mean that we can live a peaceful life ... [it would mean] returning to the life we lived before October 7.\nI long to go back to my home and live a normal life, to send my children to school in the morning, to sit on the balcony, drink coffee, and listen to Fairouz.\nAmina Al-Qurra, MSF social worker\nI long to go back to my home and live a normal life, to send my children to school in the morning, to sit on the balcony, drink coffee, and listen to Fairouz.

I miss it so much\u2014family gatherings, seeing my mother, whom I haven\u2019t seen for over a year.\n\"I just want the good days to return\"\nJamil Hamada, MSF watchman\nA ceasefire means a lot to me. First of all, my wife and children are in Gaza [City]. I haven\u2019t seen them in 11 months. I suffer daily because I haven't seen them and because of the dangerous situation in Gaza. There\u2019s bombing day after day, night after night. I can\u2019t sleep because of the continuous bombing.\nI wonder [about my family], how are they doing? Was the house bombed or not? It\u2019s a very stressful situation.\nIt has become our life\u2019s wish to not hear gunfire or bombing, because this has affected us greatly. I wish for peace to prevail in all countries.\nJamil Hamada, MSF watchman\nMy situation has also become difficult. Psychologically, I\u2019m exhausted. I haven\u2019t seen [my family], and I\u2019m here in the south. The situation is extremely difficult because every day there\u2019s displacement. And every day, there are evacuations from one area to another ... sometimes there's no network. You go two or three days without communication and you\u2019re constantly worried about [family]. For me, there is also suffering because every day there\u2019s displacement from one area to another.\nAmal Hassan Ibrahim Al-Ghazawi, MSF hygienist. Palestine 2024 \u00a9 MSF\n\"I want to die in one piece\"\nAmal Hassan Ibrahim Al-Ghazawi, MSF hygienist\nA ceasefire means that I am going back to my house that was bombed. It took 15 years to build it, and I had been working on it [before] it was destroyed. In a moment, I lost my all of my house. It is a pile of stones now.\nI want to go back to see my daughter in the north. She is sick from the war and has suffered greatly. She was in great need of me but I couldn\u2019t be with her. I want to see my brother's grave. He was killed during the war and my other siblings, my family, and relatives. I want to see my country, family, people, I want to see what happened to the north of Gaza. What more can I say?\nI want to see my country, family, people, I want to see what happened to the north of Gaza. What more can I say?\nAmal Hassan Ibrahim Al-Ghazawi, MSF hygienist\nI miss my daughter, a piece of my heart. I am deprived of seeing her. I see her in video calls, but the connection is difficult. I wish I could see her, check on her, and see what condition she is in. The house next to my daughter's was bombed. She was in the bathroom and screamed, which caused her psychological trauma. She is in a better condition now, but remembering the past worsens her state.\nDr. Mohamed Abu Mughaiseb, MSF deputy medical coordinator. Palestine 2024 \u00a9 MSF\n\"I remember every corner of my house\"\nDr. Mohamed Abu Mughaiseb, MSF deputy medical coordinator\nI had a house, a family. I remember every corner of my house\u2014the living room, the bedroom, the garden. It was my dream to have this house. I was working with my wife to build and to have it like this. Sitting, chatting, laughing, smiling, joking. We could buy whatever we wanted\u2014sweets for the kids, chocolates, vegetables, fruits. We were making plans. We had dreams. Our kids were growing up before our eyes. We were planning for their future.\nAll of this changed suddenly, on the 7th of October. Drinkable water was not available, food was not available. We went to Rafah, on the coastal side, in what is called the humanitarian zone\u2014[but] it is not a humanitarian zone. It was hell because strikes didn't stop.\nWhat do I miss most from my previous life? Everything! My memories have almost been erased, memories of the last 24 years in Gaza have mostly faded so all that is left is my family. I hope they are always safe, as they now are, and that God will unite me with them.\nDr. Mohamed Abu Mughaiseb, MSF deputy medical coordinator\nHow can I protect my family on a daily basis? I managed to take my family out of Gaza to go to Cairo. Now I'm alone since February. I have moved maybe five times from my place in Rafah. I need to evacuate. I struggle to go to the toilet, the shared toilet, [because it is] busy and I have to wait. I'm far from my family. I feel lonely, mentally tired. I need to reunite with my wife, my daughter, my two boys.",

        "content": "title: One year on from the 7 October attacks in Israel: helping the helpers \n content: As the 1-year mark of the October 2023 Hamas-led attacks passes in Israel, the mental health crisis triggered by the atrocities of that day looms large.\nFrontline responders, such as the ambulance drivers and health workers in hospitals who received the wounded or were first to attend the scenes of the attack, witnessed first-hand the carnage and horror. Others, who later supported with the identification of bodies and the preparation of the dead for burial were also powerfully affected by what they saw.\nIn response to this collective trauma, one organization, Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach (which translates as \u201cBringing back the spirit\u201d), is providing mental health and psychosocial support for frontline workers. Its workshop retreats, which have been supported by WHO/Europe, offer a safe space for participants to discuss and process their experiences, and to develop resilience and coping mechanisms that enable them to face the future and support other frontline workers.\nHelping the helpers\nIn the days after the attacks, like many others, Eyal Kravitz, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach watched videos of responders helping in unimaginably difficult situations. \u201cI just felt that the first responders and the caregivers would need assistance. So I decided to build a supportive group for civilians.\u201d He worked with co-founder Daniel Chermon and others to draw up a plan of action.\n\u201cSo many people came forward to help in the days after the attacks,\u201d recalls Chermon, \u201cAnd we thought, who is helping the helpers?\u201d.\nVered Atzmon Meshulam, another co-founder and Professional Director of Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach is one of those helpers. In the immediate aftermath of the 7 October attacks, she volunteered as a psychologist to support bereaved families as they identified the bodies of their loved ones.\nThis difficult and profound experience brought her into contact with the search and recovery volunteers, who were some of the first to attend the scenes of the attacks. The experience affected them deeply, and insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety surged, with a ripple effect that impacted on their families and at their workplace. However, in the chaos of the following months, there was no organization to support them through their ordeal.\nMashiv Ha\u2019Ruach stepped in to fill this gap, delivering a programme of workshops developed by Atzmon Meshulam. The workshops are held as part of a retreat, which takes place in the desert, far from the noise and distraction of daily life. Group sessions allow participants to share their experiences and build a strong support network that endures after the retreat is over.\n\u201cOne of the symptoms of trauma is that people are very isolated from others. They feel that nobody can understand what they saw,\u201d says Atzmon Meshulam.\nAmong the groups the organization has worked with are wives of injured soldiers, volunteer first responders and medical staff from Soroka Medical Center, who received many of the victims of the attacks.\nProcessing trauma together\nThe attacks on 7 October left Israelis deeply scarred and frightened. For many, moving forward with their lives and regaining a sense of security and normalcy seemed impossible at the time and remains difficult today.\nHowever, in the initial months after the attacks, many volunteers were not ready or willing to speak about what they had seen.\n\u201cAt first, no one thought they needed to talk about their experiences,\u201d says Chermon. \u201cSo it was initially hard for us to convince them to come, but once they came, people started hearing from their colleagues about the value of the retreats.\u201d\nA language to describe feelings and share experiences\nOz Tal has volunteered with a nongovernmental organization (NGO) dedicated to search and recovery operations for many years. He responded in the aftermath of the attacks, even coming under fire as he attempted to retrieve bodies from the Nova Festival.\nHe says the workshops gave him a language to describe and express his feelings, and sharing his experiences with others has allowed him to process his trauma. Now he encourages his colleagues to attend a retreat.\n\u201cFirst of all, most of the volunteers, when I tell them to come to the retreat, they tell me that they\u2019re okay. They don\u2019t need anything. They don\u2019t want to come. But during the retreat, after we start talking about our feelings, the first one starts talking and starts sharing their problems, then the whole group starts. You cannot imagine the spirit in the room in that moment.\u201d\nThe workshops encompass activities intended to help participants make sense of their traumatic experiences, to find coping mechanisms and, in effect, a language to speak about what they have been through.\n\u201cThe therapists are working with the volunteers on the meaning they give to their story because the story is a reality,\u201d says Atzmon Meshulam. \u201cYou can\u2019t change the parts that contain horrors, but you can change the way you are talking with yourself about what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d\nAfter the retreat, participants are calmer, she says. \u201cI received a message from the wife of a volunteer who attended the workshops. She wrote to me that she had got a new man back, that this was the first time that he had slept through the night since October 7th.\u201d\nThe organization is now offering retreats to the partners of affected staff and volunteers, to build a wider network of resilience and support skills.\nHodaya Leshem, a mother of four who attended a retreat is married to an injured soldier. \u201cI had no support before I came to the meetings. I had to hold everyone in the family and community together, but there was no one there to hold me.\u201d\nBuilding resilience\nSoroka Medical Center, 40 km from Gaza, is the hospital that took in most of the wounded on 7 October. In the first 16 hours, the emergency department treated about 680 patients, of whom 120 were critically wounded.\nMany of Soroka\u2019s staff lost close relatives or live in the areas that were attacked, and among the victims were 2 physicians and 2 retired nurses.\nDr Dan Schwarzfuchs, Deputy Director General and Director of the Emergency Department at Soroka Medical Center, knew he had to find an outlet for his staff to talk about their experiences.\n\u201cThey are strong,\u201d he says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t survive in this job if you were not. But this was an exceptional experience that affected every aspect of people\u2019s lives. I knew in my belly I had to find something that would help them stay resilient.\u201d\n\u201cEvery staff member has a story,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe therapy makes them stronger and because of this experience we are more connected. Colleagues who before didn\u2019t want to speak about their experiences are opening up because they hear experiences from others. People I didn\u2019t expect would ever attend are doing so now.\u201d\nAyelet Harris is Head of the Community Department of the Kibbutz Movement. In the days and months after the attacks she was closely supporting the families of kibbutz dwellers, many of whom had lost family members, and many of whom had had to evacuate.\n\u201cThis was the first time us responders could express ourselves. Our energy was always pointing outwards to help other people and to be there for them,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the retreat, I felt that this was one of the first times I felt re-energized, as the focus was on me and my needs. It was a safe place for me to express what I went through, and someone was there to listen to me. It was a place where I could just be me. This was refreshing and renewing.\u201d\nOne year on \u2013 taking stock\nSince January 2024, Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach has supported almost 1000 people through their retreats.\n\u201cEach participant is not there only for themselves. They become an ambassador, supporting 30 or 40 people in their workplace or community,\u201d says Kravitz.\nOn the first anniversary of 7 October, Dr Schwarzfuchs will be in Soroka Medical Center. \u201cI thought of staying home with my own recollections, but I know that some of the patients that we treated on that day will return, to try to psychologically close the loop. I will go in to be there for them, and for my staff.\u201d\nHe believes that 1 year on, people are more ready to speak about their experiences.\n\u201cIn the beginning, people have to fight or to fly. You close yourself off; you want to be in control of yourself. But I feel that the more time is passing, the more people want to speak.\u201d\nChermon acknowledges the huge need for psychosocial support among those who are helping others: \u201cWe didn\u2019t start Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach under good circumstances. But the fact is that people need it and they\u2019re going to still need it for years to come\u201d.\nKravitz continues: \u201cThe support of WHO has been pivotal in enabling us to reach more individuals and groups in need. We are proud to be the only resilience initiative in Israel that has received WHO recognition, thanks to the recommendation of the Israeli Ministry of Health. This partnership has been invaluable, and I want to express our deep appreciation for WHO\u201d.\nWHO\u2019s mandate is to support health providers and civilians in need, no matter who or where. Alongside support for Mashiv Ha\u2019Ruach, WHO has supported the Israeli NGO Mosaica to develop an initiative that leverages the influence of religious leaders from both Jewish and Muslim communities to connect people with critical mental health support, increasing the uptake of these services and reducing the stigma of seeking help.",

        "content": "title: Humanitarian Situation Update #227 | Gaza Strip \n content: As of 4 October, the Humanitarian Situation Update is issued by OCHA Occupied Palestinian Territory twice a week. The Gaza Strip is covered on Tuesdays and the West Bank on Thursdays. The Gaza Humanitarian Response Update continues to be issued every other Wednesday. The next Humanitarian Situation Update will be issued on 10 October.\nKey Highlights\n- Hundreds of thousands of people and dozens of humanitarian facilities have been affected by four new evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military; at least 70,000 people have been displaced and there are growing risks that humanitarian access will be further constrained, particularly between southern and northern Gaza.\n- The Israeli military launches a military operation in northern Gaza and the area is becoming increasingly cut off.\n- September saw the lowest volume of commercial and humanitarian supplies entering Gaza since at least March 2024, with a drop in dietary diversity of children aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women across Gaza, reports UNICEF.\n- Nearly 68 per cent of Gaza\u2019s cropland has been damaged, increasing the imminent risk of famine and jeopardizing current and future potential food production, warns FAO.\nHumanitarian Developments\n- Israeli bombardment from the air, land and sea continues to be reported across the Gaza Strip, resulting in further civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of civilian infrastructure. Between 5 and 7 October, Israeli forces issued several evacuation orders for areas in northern Deir al Balah, North Gaza and Gaza governorates, reminding residents that these areas are still considered active combat zones, as well as areas in Khan Younis (additional information available below). On 6 October, the Israeli military announced that a military operation commenced the night before in Jabalya, with heavy fighting in the area reported. Rocket fire by Palestinian armed groups toward Israel was also reported. On 7 October, the UN Human Rights Office stated that the \u201cattacks in northern Gaza, combined with mass evacuation orders, which are inconsistent with international humanitarian law, raise serious concerns about the forced displacement and forced transfer of Palestinian residents of Gaza.\u201d\n- In a statement marking one year since the 7 October attack in Israel and the escalation of hostilities in Gaza, Ms. Joyce Msuya, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator said that no \u201cstatistics or words can fully convey the extent of the physical, mental and societal devastation that has taken place,\" stressing that \u201cwe know what must happen: The hostages must be released and treated humanely. Civilians must be protected and their essential needs met. Palestinians arbitrarily detained must be released. Humanitarian workers must be safeguarded and their work facilitated. Perpetrators must be held accountable for any serious violations of international humanitarian law. And the assault on Gaza must stop.\u201d\n- Between the afternoons of 4 and 7 October, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, 163 Palestinians were killed and 737 were injured. Between 7 October 2023 and 8 October 2024, at least 41,965 Palestinians were killed and 97,590 were injured, according to MoH in Gaza.\n- The following are some of the deadly incidents reported between 4 and 6 October:\n- On 4 October, at about 14:10, five female Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Al Bureij refugee camp, in Deir al Balah.\n- On 4 October, at about 16:00, seven Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit, in Ash Shati\u2019 (Beach) camp, in Gaza city.\n- On 4 October, at about 23:30, six Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit northeast of An Nuseirat refugee camp, in Deir al Balah.\n- On 5 October, at about 8:30, six Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a group of people was hit in east Beit Hanoun, in North Gaza.\n- On 5 October, at about 20:00, ten Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit, in Jabaliya town, in North Gaza.\n- On 5 October, at about 22:00, nine Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit west of Jabalya refugee camp, in North Gaza.\n- On 5 October, at about 22:00, five Palestinians, including two children and two women, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Beit Lahiya, in North Gaza.\n- On 6 October, at about 2:10, 21 Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when Al Aqsa Martyrs Mosque in front of Al Aqsa Hospital was hit in Deir al Balah.\n- On 6 October, at about 14:10, five Palestinians, including one girl, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Ash Shati' refugee camp west of Gaza city. The Palestinian Civil Defense reported that others remained under rubble.\n- Between the afternoons of 4 and 8 October, one Israeli soldier was reportedly killed in Gaza and one soldier died of wounds sustained in Gaza in June 2024, according to the Israeli military. Between 7 October 2023 and 8 October 2024, according to the Israeli military and official Israeli sources cited in the media, more than 1,548 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, the majority on 7 October 2023 and its immediate aftermath. The figure includes 348 soldiers killed in Gaza or along the border in Israel since the beginning of the ground operation. In addition, 2,299 Israeli soldiers were reported injured since the beginning of the ground operation.\n- Between 5 and 7 October, the Israeli military issued four new evacuation orders for: 11 blocks in Al Bureij and An Nuseirat refugee camps in northern Deir Al Balah; Gaza and North Gaza governorates; 31 neighbourhoods in North Gaza including Beit Hanoun, Jabalya and Beit Lahiya; and eight neighbourhoods in Khan Younis. Residents were ordered to relocate immediately to Al Mawasi area west of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. According to the same announcements by the Israeli military, the area designated for civilians to stay (Al Mawasi) initially expanded by 10.71 square kilometres and was subsequently reduced by 1.4 square kilometres. As of 7 October, the Israeli-designated area for civilians to relocate is estimated to span 57 square kilometres or some 15 per cent of the Gaza Strip. At present, the total area covered by evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip, excluding those that have been revoked, constitutes about 84 per cent of the Gaza Strip.\n- These orders affect hundreds of thousands of people, particularly in northern Gaza where more than 400,000 people are under pressure to move southward to Al Mawasi, which is already overcrowded and lacks basic services. Humanitarian access also risks becoming further constrained, particularly between southern and northern Gaza, and so are the accessibility and functionality of key humanitarian facilities within areas slated for evacuation. Initial estimates from the Site Management Working Group (SMWG) indicate that about 50,000 people have already moved from North Gaza toward Gaza city and more than 20,000 have moved from An Nuseirat and Al Bureij refugee camps toward southern Deir al Balah and Khan Younis. The SMWG additionally reports that 12 sites for internally displaced persons (IDPs) are in areas newly affected by these orders in northern Deir al Balah, and so are more than 300 patients in the Indonesian, Kamal Adwan and Al Awda hospitals in North Gaza according to the Health Cluster, and dozens of facilities that offer critical health, water, hygiene, sanitation, and education services.\n- Overall, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 10 hospitals with a cumulative capacity of 730 beds, 19 primary health-care centres and 32 medical points in the North Gaza and Gaza governorates risk being affected by the unfolding situation. Should WHO and its partners be unable to maintain these facilities fuelled, critical health services in Intensive Care Units, operation theatres, maternity wards, haemodialysis units and emergency departments might have to be abruptly stopped. Additionally, essential health supplies and medications must be immediately delivered to these facilities, including trauma disposables and medications for patients with non-communicable diseases. In light of the dire shortage of blood units, on 7 October, the Ministry of Health appealed to people in northern Gaza to urgently donate blood, either at the Emergency Department of Al Shifa Hospital or at As Sahaba Medical Complex.\n- The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) reports that, in September, the volume of supplies entering Gaza \u2013 both commercial and humanitarian \u2013 has been the lowest since at least March 2024, noting that the situation is expected to further deteriorate. A survey conducted by UNICEF in mid-September of over 2,500 recipients of humanitarian cash assistance shows that both the availability of goods and the dietary diversity of children aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women decreased across all areas of Gaza compared with July. According to survey responses, over 35 per cent of children and 40 per cent of pregnant and breastfeeding women had only eaten one food type the day prior to the survey and 30 per cent in both groups had only consumed two food types. Moreover, only five per cent of pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed dairy products, and six per cent of children had eaten some meat, with these percentages plummeting to one and three per cent in northern Gaza, respectively. Moreover, the survey, complemented by in-person visits to markets, showed further price increases of basic food items in northern Gaza. For example, rice and vegetable oil in northern Gaza now cost more than US$5 per kilogramme (kg) or litre (l), while remaining more affordable in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis (below $2/kg and 2.5/l, respectively).\n- According to the World Food Programme (WFP), in the northern governorates, wheat flour and canned food are the only food items readily available on the market. Dairy products are unavailable, while vegetables, fruits, eggs, and vegetable oil are in severe shortage and priced very high. Other food items, such as pulses and rice, are moderately available. In Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, wheat flour, canned food, rice, pulses, and vegetable oil remain available. However, there is a moderate shortage of vegetables and eggs, while dairy products are in severe shortage. Media reports suggest that the spike in the price of market commodities is partly due to extremely high increases in costs of bringing in commercial supplies, including hefty import permits, transportation costs, and fees paid to private security companies to secure the trucks due to looting driven by the breakdown of law and order. These costs are then passed on to consumers. An analysis conducted by Christian Aid in late August in northern Gaza shows that, while the price of some staples like bread and flour has decreased since March, others have continued to soar, with onions for instance costing 700 per cent more compared to five months prior, and some products such as chicken, dates or bottled water being unavailable, forcing people to buy drinking water from mobile tanks.\n- No cooking gas has entered northern Gaza for twelve consecutive months, according to the Food Security Sector (FSS), while the price of firewood on the market is making it inaccessible to most households. Firewood found in markets is sourced from the remains of demolished homes, furniture and electricity poles, WFP reports, and its relatively high prices, combined with severe gas shortages \u201cis pushing more people into energy poverty.\u201d This continues to force displaced families, who are among the most vulnerable people, to cook by burning wood and plastic from waste, which hinders proper food preparation, exacerbates health risks and causes environmental hazards, including the risk of fires in severely overcrowded tent sites.\n- The latest satellite-based agricultural damage assessment conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and UNOSAT shows that 67.6 per cent of Gaza\u2019s cropland had been damaged, as of 1 September, up from 57.3 per cent in May and 42.6 per cent in February 2024, with North Gaza currently having the highest proportion of damage among all governorates (78.2 per cent). Additionally, over 71 per cent of orchards and other trees, 67 per cent of field crops, and 58.5 per cent of vegetables have been damaged. Heavy vehicle tracks, razing, shelling, and other conflict-related pressures have also significantly damaged Gaza\u2019s agricultural infrastructure, with a total of 1,188 out of 2,261 agricultural wells (52.5 per cent) and over 44 per cent of greenhouses damaged. Furthermore, most of the Gaza city port infrastructure and vessels were destroyed in October 2023 and remain non-functional, with severe repercussions on trade and livelihoods.\n- The extremely limited entry of fertilizers and other livestock and crop production inputs into the Strip continues to be a key obstacle hampering the restoration of local food production in Gaza, with agricultural activities \u2013 including small-scale gardening that is critical to enhance dietary diversity \u2013 remaining largely suspended, highlights FSS. Coupled with the \u201cunprecedented levels\u201d of agricultural damage in Gaza, FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol, stressed that this \u201craises serious concerns about the potential for food production now and in the future\u201d and \u201ccompounds the imminent risk of famine in the whole Gaza Strip.\u201d\n- The Gaza Strip has faced a year of humanitarian crisis, with frontline civil defense, health, and aid workers enduring immense challenges. Over 300 aid workers have lost their lives in Gaza, the majority being UNRWA staff, making Gaza the most dangerous place for aid workers globally. The situation is equally dire for health workers; MoH reported that a total of 986 health workers have been killed, including some who are counted as aid workers. Furthermore, the Palestinian Civil Defense (PCD), which is currently operating at 20 per cent of its capacity, reported that 85 of its staff have been killed, and another 292 injured, with 14 instances of staff being hit while on duty. Additionally, 52 PCD vehicles have been destroyed or damaged, and a lack of fuel and spare parts, alongside access constraints, have resulted in over 15,600 unaddressed appeals for assistance, PCD reported.\nFunding\n- As of 8 October, Member States have disbursed about $1.72 billion out of the $3.42 billion (50 per cent) requested to meet the most critical needs of 2.3 million* people in Gaza and 800,000 people in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between January and December 2024. For funding analysis, please see the Flash Appeal Financial Tracking dashboard. (*2.3 million reflects the projected population of the Gaza Strip upon issuance of the Flash Appeal in April 2024. As of July 2024, the UN estimates that about 2.1 million people remain in the Gaza Strip, and this updated number is now used for programmatic purposes.)\n- During September 2024, the Occupied Palestinian Territory Humanitarian Fund (OPT HF) managed 87 ongoing projects, totalling $77.5 million. These projects aimed to address urgent needs in the Gaza Strip (90 per cent) and the West Bank (10 per cent). They were strategically focused on education, food security, health, protection, emergency shelter and non-food items, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), coordination and support services, multi-purpose cash assistance and nutrition. Of these projects, 48 projects are being implemented by international non-governmental organizations, 27 by national NGOs and 12 by UN agencies. Notably, 31 out of the 60 projects implemented by INGOs or the UN are being implemented in collaboration with national NGOs. Monthly updates, annual reports, and a list of all funded projects per year, are available on the oPt Humanitarian Fund webpage, under the financing section.\nDisclaimer\n- UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n- To learn more about OCHA's activities, please visit https://www.unocha.org/.",

On 7 October, the UN Human Rights Office stated that the \u201cattacks in northern Gaza, combined with mass evacuation orders, which are inconsistent with international humanitarian law, raise serious concerns about the forced displacement and forced transfer of Palestinian residents of Gaza.\u201d\n\nIn a statement marking one year since the 7 October attack in Israel and the escalation of hostilities in Gaza, Ms. Joyce Msuya, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator said that no \u201cstatistics or words can fully convey the extent of the physical, mental and societal devastation that has taken place,\" stressing that \u201cwe know what must happen: The hostages must be released and treated humanely. Civilians must be protected and their essential needs met. Palestinians arbitrarily detained must be released. Humanitarian workers must be safeguarded and their work facilitated. Perpetrators must be held accountable for any serious violations of international humanitarian law. And the assault on Gaza must stop.\u201d\n\nBetween the afternoons of 4 and 7 October, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, 163 Palestinians were killed and 737 were injured. Between 7 October 2023 and 8 October 2024, at least 41,965 Palestinians were killed and 97,590 were injured, according to MoH in Gaza.\n\nThe following are some of the deadly incidents reported between 4 and 6 October:\n\nhttps://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-227-gaza-strip\n\n1/3\n---\n10/8/24, 1:06 PM\n\nHumanitarian Situation Update #227 | Gaza Strip | United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - occupied Palestinian territory On 4 October, at about 14:10, five female Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Al Bureij refugee camp, in Deir al Balah.\n\nOn 4 October, at about 16:00, seven Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit, in Ash Shati\u2019 (Beach) camp, in Gaza city.\n\nOn 4 October, at about 23:30, six Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit northeast of An Nuseirat refugee camp, in Deir al Balah.\n\nOn 5 October, at about 8:30, six Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a group of people was hit in east Beit Hanoun, in North Gaza.\n\nOn 5 October, at about 20:00, ten Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit, in Jabaliya town, in North Gaza.\n\nOn 5 October, at about 22:00, nine Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit west of Jabalya refugee camp, in North Gaza.\n\nOn 5 October, at about 22:00, five Palestinians, including two children and two women, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Beit Lahiya, in North Gaza.\n\nOn 6 October, at about 2:10, 21 Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when Al Aqsa Martyrs Mosque in front of Al Aqsa Hospital was hit in Deir al Balah.\n\nOn 6 October, at about 14:10, five Palestinians, including one girl, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Ash Shati' refugee camp west of Gaza city. The Palestinian Civil Defense reported that others remained under rubble.\n\nBetween the afternoons of 4 and 8 October, one Israeli soldier was reportedly killed in Gaza and one soldier died of wounds sustained in Gaza in June 2024, according to the Israeli military. Between 7 October 2023 and 8 October 2024, according to the Israeli military and official Israeli sources cited in the media, more than 1,548 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, the majority on 7 October 2023 and its immediate aftermath. The figure includes 348 soldiers killed in Gaza or along the border in Israel since the beginning of the ground operation. In addition, 2,299 Israeli soldiers were reported injured since the beginning of the ground operation.\n\nBetween 5 and 7 October, the Israeli military issued four new evacuation orders for: 11 blocks in Al Bureij and An Nuseirat refugee camps in northern Deir Al Balah; Gaza and North Gaza governorates; 31 neighbourhoods in North Gaza including Beit Hanoun, Jabalya and Beit Lahiya; and eight neighbourhoods in Khan Younis. Residents were ordered to relocate immediately to Al Mawasi area west of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. According to the same announcements by the Israeli military, the area designated for civilians to stay (Al Mawasi) initially expanded by 10.71 square kilometres and was subsequently reduced by 1.4 square kilometres. As of 7 October, the Israeli-designated area for civilians to relocate is estimated to span 57 square kilometres or some 15 per cent of the Gaza Strip. At present, the total area covered by evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip, excluding those that have been revoked, constitutes about 84 per cent of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThese orders affect hundreds of thousands of people, particularly in northern Gaza where more than 400,000 people are under pressure to move southward to Al Mawasi, which is already overcrowded and lacks basic services. Humanitarian access also risks becoming further constrained, particularly between southern and northern Gaza, and so are the accessibility and functionality of key humanitarian facilities within areas slated for evacuation. Initial estimates from the Site Management Working Group (SMWG) indicate that about 50,000 people have already moved from North Gaza toward Gaza city and more than 20,000 have moved from An Nuseirat and Al Bureij refugee camps toward southern Deir al Balah and Khan Younis. The SMWG additionally reports that 12 sites for internally displaced persons (IDPs) are in areas newly affected by these orders in northern Deir al Balah, and so are more than 300 patients in the Indonesian, Kamal Adwan and Al Awda hospitals in North Gaza according to the Health Cluster, and dozens of facilities that offer critical health, water, hygiene, sanitation, and education services.\n\nOverall, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 10 hospitals with a cumulative capacity of 730 beds, 19 primary health- care centres and 32 medical points in the North Gaza and Gaza governorates risk being affected by the unfolding situation. Should WHO and its partners be unable to maintain these facilities fuelled, critical health services in Intensive Care Units, operation theatres, maternity wards, haemodialysis units and emergency departments might have to be abruptly stopped. Additionally, essential health supplies and medications must be immediately delivered to these facilities, including trauma disposables and medications for patients with non-communicable diseases. In light of the dire shortage of blood units, on 7 October, the Ministry of Health appealed to people in northern Gaza to urgently donate blood, either at the Emergency Department of Al Shifa Hospital or at As Sahaba Medical Complex.\n\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) reports that, in September, the volume of supplies entering Gaza \u2013 both commercial and humanitarian \u2013 has been the lowest since at least March 2024, noting that the situation is expected to further deteriorate. A survey conducted by UNICEF in mid-September of over 2,500 recipients of humanitarian cash assistance shows that both the availability of goods and the dietary diversity of children aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women decreased across all areas of Gaza compared with July. According to survey responses, over 35 per cent of children and 40 per cent of pregnant and breastfeeding women had only eaten one food type the day prior to the survey and 30 per cent in both groups had only consumed two food types. Moreover, only five per cent of pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed dairy products, and six per cent of children had eaten some meat, with these percentages plummeting to one and three per cent in northern Gaza,\n\nhttps://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-227-gaza-strip\n\n2/3\n---\n10/8/24, 1:06 PM\n\nHumanitarian Situation Update #227 | Gaza Strip | United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - occupied Palestinian territory\n\nrespectively. Moreover, the survey, complemented by in-person visits to markets, showed further price increases of basic food items in northern Gaza. For example, rice and vegetable oil in northern Gaza now cost more than US$5 per kilogramme (kg) or litre (l), while remaining more affordable in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis (below $2/kg and 2.5/l, respectively).\n\nAccording to the World Food Programme (WFP), in the northern governorates, wheat flour and canned food are the only food items readily available on the market. Dairy products are unavailable, while vegetables, fruits, eggs, and vegetable oil are in severe shortage and priced very high. Other food items, such as pulses and rice, are moderately available. In Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, wheat flour, canned food, rice, pulses, and vegetable oil remain available. However, there is a moderate shortage of vegetables and eggs, while dairy products are in severe shortage. Media reports suggest that the spike in the price of market commodities is partly due to extremely high increases in costs of bringing in commercial supplies, including hefty import permits, transportation costs, and fees paid to private security companies to secure the trucks due to looting driven by the breakdown of law and order. These costs are then passed on to consumers. An analysis conducted by Chistian Aid in late August in northern Gaza shows that, while the price of some staples like bread and flour has decreased since March, others have continued to soar, with onions for instance costing 700 per cent more compared to five months prior, and some products such as chicken, dates or bottled water being unavailable, forcing people to buy drinking water from mobile tanks.\n\nNo cooking gas has entered northern Gaza for twelve consecutive months, according to the Food Security Sector (FSS), while the price of firewood on the market is making it inaccessible to most households. Firewood found in markets is sourced from the remains of demolished homes, furniture and electricity poles, WFP reports, and its relatively high prices, combined with severe gas shortages \u201cis pushing more people into energy poverty.\u201d This continues to force displaced families, who are among the most vulnerable people, to cook by burning wood and plastic from waste, which hinders proper food preparation, exacerbates health risks and causes environmental hazards, including the risk of fires in severely overcrowded tent sites.\n\nThe latest satellite-based agricultural damage assessment conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and UNOSAT shows that 67.6 per cent of Gaza\u2019s cropland had been damaged, as of 1 September, up from 57.3 per cent in May and 42.6 per cent in February 2024, with North Gaza currently having the highest proportion of damage among all governorates (78.2 per cent). Additionally, over 71 per cent of orchards and other trees, 67 per cent of field crops, and 58.5 per cent of vegetables have been damaged. Heavy vehicle tracks, razing, shelling, and other conflict-related pressures have also significantly damaged Gaza\u2019s agricultural infrastructure, with a total of 1,188 out of 2,261 agricultural wells (52.5 per cent) and over 44 per cent of greenhouses damaged. Furthermore, most of the Gaza city port infrastructure and vessels were destroyed in October 2023 and remain non-functional, with severe repercussions on trade and livelihoods.\n\nThe extremely limited entry of fertilizers and other livestock and crop production inputs into the Strip continues to be a key obstacle hampering the restoration of local food production in Gaza, with agricultural activities \u2013 including small-scale gardening that is critical to enhance dietary diversity \u2013 remaining largely suspended, highlights FSS. Coupled with the \u201cunprecedented levels\u201d of agricultural damage in Gaza, FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol, stressed that this \u201craises serious concerns about the potential for food production now and in the future\u201d and \u201ccompounds the imminent risk of famine in the whole Gaza Strip.\u201d\n\nThe Gaza Strip has faced a year of humanitarian crisis, with frontline civil defense, health, and aid workers enduring immense challenges. Over 300 aid workers have lost their lives in Gaza, the majority being UNRWA staff, making Gaza the most dangerous place for aid workers globally. The situation is equally dire for health workers; MoH reported that a total of 986 health workers have been killed, including some who are counted as aid workers. Furthermore, the Palestinian Civil Defense (PCD), which is currently operating at 20 per cent of its capacity, reported that 85 of its staff have been killed, and another 292 injured, with 14 instances of staff being hit while on duty. Additionally, 52 PCD vehicles have been destroyed or damaged, and a lack of fuel and spare parts, alongside access constraints, have resulted in over 15,600 unaddressed appeals for assistance, PCD reported.\n\nFunding\n\nAs of 8 October, Member States have disbursed about $1.72 billion out of the $3.42 billion (50 per cent) requested to meet the most critical needs of 2.3 million* people in Gaza and 800,000 people in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between January and December 2024. For funding analysis, please see the Flash Appeal Financial Tracking dashboard. (*2.3 million reflects the projected population of the Gaza Strip upon issuance of the Flash Appeal in April 2024. As of July 2024, the UN estimates that about 2.1 million people remain in the Gaza Strip, and this updated number is now used for programmatic purposes.)\n\nDuring September 2024, the Occupied Palestinian Territory Humanitarian Fund (OPT HF) managed 87 ongoing projects, totalling $77.5 million. These projects aimed to address urgent needs in the Gaza Strip (90 per cent) and the West Bank (10 per cent). They were strategically focused on education, food security, health, protection, emergency shelter and non-food items, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), coordination and support services, multi-purpose cash assistance and nutrition. Of these projects, 48 projects are being implemented by international non-governmental organizations, 27 by national NGOs and 12 by UN agencies. Notably, 31 out of the 60 projects implemented by INGOs or the UN are being implemented in collaboration with national NGOs. Monthly updates, annual reports, and a list of all funded projects per year, are available on the oPt Humanitarian Fund webpage, under the financing section.\n\nhttps://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-227-gaza-strip\n\n3/3",

Since 7 October 2023, the hostilities have caused extensive loss of life, widespread destruction of homes, and severe damage to vital infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and utilities. Civilians, especially women, children, and older persons, as well as persons with disabilities and persons with illnesses are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the violence, with many losing their homes, loved ones, and access to basic services.\n\nIsrael\u2019s restrictions on the entry of food, water, medicine, electricity and fuel, and continuing forms of siege imposed on Gaza have created a dire humanitarian situation in which Palestinians are dying of disease and hunger. Many people are suffering from acute food insecurity. The UN Human Rights Office has repeatedly urged the Israeli forces to avoid targeting civilians and civilian objects, including healthcare facilities and personnel, and in any event to minimize loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.\n\nThe war has compounded an already dire situation in Gaza, where years of blockade and recurring cycles of conflict have severely constrained access to food, medical supplies, and essential services.\n\nHospitals are destroyed, and healthcare facilities are struggling to provide critical care to the thousands of injured. The destruction of power and water systems has left large parts of the population without access to clean water and sanitation, increasing the risk of spread of disease.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Gaza, and repeated \u201cevacuation orders\u201d lead to displacement at an alarming rate, with hundreds of thousands of civilians forced to flee their homes. Many are seeking refuge in overcrowded \u201cshelters\u201d, which themselves have been subject to attacks. The lack of safe corridors and the ongoing violence have hindered humanitarian efforts to deliver life-saving aid, leaving people in desperate need of food, water, and medical assistance.\n\nIn addition, thousands of Palestinians have been arbitrarily detained, often held in secret, incommunicado detention, with consistent reports of ill-treatment and torture at the hands of Israeli security forces.\n\n\u201cI urge all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire, lay down their arms. Stop the killing once and for all.\u201d\n\nIn the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem, Israel has increased its use of airstrikes, attack helicopters, anti-tank missiles, shoulder-fired explosive projectiles and other weapons of war, resulting in destruction of civilian infrastructure, displacement, and the killing and injuries of hundreds of Palestinians, including children.\n\nAcross the West Bank, Palestinians are being driven from their homes and land, due to multiple coercive factors, including demolitions of property, settler violence, systematic discrimination, debilitating movement restrictions and Israeli forces arrests and often violent operations, which risks seriously deepening the already catastrophic situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nFollowing 7 October 2023, Israeli authorities distributed thousands of weapons to civilians and drafted around 5,000 settlers into regional defense battalions. This led to a significant rise in violence by armed settlers and soldiers, including against children, with the distinction between state and settler violence further blurred during this period.\n\nFurthermore, free expression and civic space are under unprecedented pressure, with legitimate forms of speech and criticism being met with heavy retaliation by Israeli forces.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also continually called for an end to the suffering and urged all\n\nparties to ensure compliance with international humanitarian\n\nlaw. The UN Human Rights OPT Office however continues to document serious violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law by Palestinian armed groups and the Israeli military, including possible war crimes and other atrocity crimes.\n---\nGaza\n\nThe attacks by Palestinian armed groups on 7 October 2023 resulted in the killings of at least 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, 1 with reports of torture and sexual violence. Over 230 hostages were taken into Gaza, 101 are still held there,\n\nwhile at least 35 hostages have reportedly been killed. Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza, has led to the deaths of 41,4952 Palestinians, which is greater than all previous escalations of hostilities in Gaza combined. On average, about 130 people have been killed every day in Gaza and most of the dead are women and children. Over 96,000 Palestinians have been injured, many permanently. 495,0003 people are already starving at the \u201cCatastrophe\u201d IPC five category. 1.9 million Palestinians are displaced and uprooted from their homes - many multiple times. At least 17 ,000 children are orphaned or separated from their families. Only 1 1 out of 36 hospitals remain partially functional and strikes have killed more than 885 health and medical workers, impacted hospitals and destroyed ambulances. Over 85% of school buildings have been damaged or destroyed and 625,000 children have lost a full year of education. Gender-based violence including cases of sexual abuse in shelters and host communities with intensifying protection and health risks particularly for girls, due to a lack of private, safe, and sanitary bathing and latrine facilities. Increase in violence against children within their families and communities, and of children being driven into child labour, including high-risk activities such as foraging for scrap metal, bringing children into contact with explosive remnants of war.\n\nWest Bank Including East Jerusalem\n\n\u2022 In the West Bank, 692 Palestinians were killed,4 including 161 children (157 boys and four girls), nine women and at least five persons with a disability, the highest levels since UN records began in 2005. \u2022 Over 1,510 Palestinians, including 627 children, have been displaced from at least 39 herding communities in Area C, and over 1,000 Palestinians have been displaced following Israeli forces operations in Jenin. \u2022 Between 7 October 2023 and 1 September 2024, OCHA recorded over 1,270 attacks by Israeli forces. \u2022 Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced the demolition of 1,697 Palestinian structures across the West Bank, displacing more than 4,400 Palestinians, including about 1,850 children. \u2022 According to the Jenin municipality, 70% of road networks have been destroyed, severely affecting the underlying infrastructure for water, sewage, and internet services.\n\n1 According to the Israeli Ministry of Defense 2 According to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry (as of 25 September 2024) 3 According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 4 Of the verified fatalities, Israeli security forces killed at least 673 Palestinians, settlers killed 11 Palestinians, and 8 Palestinians were killed either by Israeli security forces or settlers (figures verified by UN Human Rights OPT Office)\n\n3 UN Human Rights Occupied Palestinian Territory 2025 Funding Appeal\n---\nOur\n\nResponse\n\nThe high civilian casualties and injuries, mass displacement, destruction of infrastructure, the imposition of a siege, mass arrests, accelerated settlement expansion, and the prolonged emergency has already resulted in a human rights and humanitarian crisis of enormous magnitude.\n\nIn response, the UN Human Rights OPT Office has amplified its human rights monitoring and humanitarian protection work, including repurposing human resources and operational capacity, deploying teams into Gaza and across the West Bank, and onboarding additional staff with expertise in Women\u2019s Rights and Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Information Management, Communications, Security Coordination, and Military Expertise.\n\nProtection cluster mission in Gaza, Apr 2024. \u00a9OCHA OPT\n\nWhat Is Protection?\n\nIn humanitarian emergencies people become more vulnerable and are at risk of physical and psychological injury, abuse, violence and deprivation. In particular, some people are at greater risk including children, youth, elderly, women and girls, pregnant women and those with disabilities or chronic illness. Humanitarian protection are activities designed to prevent or minimize people\u2019s exposure to risks, mitigate/respond to the needs of those who have been exposed and to uphold human rights in accordance with international law. Protection is central to humanitarian response.\n\nProtection Cluster Emergency Operations Activated\n\nAs the lead agency of the Humanitarian Protection Cluster, the UN Human Rights OPT Office coordinates protection responses of about 100 inter-governmental organizations, national and UN partners across GBV, Child Protection, Mine Action, Housing Land and Property, monitoring and reporting, and advocacy.\n\nTo strengthen the humanitarian response, UN Human Rights OPT Office and its partners are putting in place protection measures including the training and deployment of Emergency Protection Responders (EPRs), available on rotation 24/7 for any new assignment with the Protection Cluster targeting internally displaced populations severely\n\naffected by the ongoing escalations within Gaza and deprived of dignified and safe services either in their primary residential areas or in new areas of displacement.\n\nIn parallel, the Protection Cluster is working with partners to re-establish light versions of protection specialized services and referral pathways (case management, GBV response, psycho-social support services), family reunification, registration and alternative care, material assistance (assistive devices, dignity kits), explosive ordnance risk education and risk assessments.\n\nWhen the situation allows, the Office aims to create two presences in Southern Gaza and Middle/North Gaza to coordinate and deliver these protection services.\n---\nThe EPRs model is also being rolled out in the West Bank for communities under siege of Israeli military style operations, mass arbitrary detention, unprecedented levels of settler violence and with significant risk of forcible transfer and displacement.\n\nDelivering Emergency Protection Responses, to Children, Women, Vulnerable Groups & Others\n\nThe crisis has profoundly impacted protection cluster partners on the ground. National NGOs in the OPT have always been and will remain the backbone of protection responses. However, these are the very same people who are being injured, displaced, separated, traumatized and are grieving their loved ones. Communication with partners is unreliable at best and non-existent in some cases. The UN Human Rights OPT Office is still working closely with partners on the ground to adapt to the rapidly changing and hostile environment, to deliver a coordinated protection response of critical services.\n\nScale up protection cluster work protection cluster on the ground:\n\nto\n\nsupport\n\nthe\n\nIntegration of protection responses across all sectors, through the EPRs model creating a pool of protection professionals and frontline inter-sectoral humanitarian workers to provide coordinated, time-critical, lifesaving and general protection support for affected communities.\n\nEnsuring coherent and targeted responses across child protection, gender-based violence, mine action, legal aid and cross-cutting approaches, including provision of material as well as cash-for-protection assistance to address critical needs. Strengthening integration of protection in all humanitarian sectors, to ensure vulnerable population groups, including persons with disabilities, and those at risk of abuse are prioritized across the emergency response. Community response mechanisms and support to community-led initiatives. Risk mitigation measures to avoid further harm to families, vulnerable groups and children, during primary response and distribution, as well as explosive ordnance risk education, and GBV risk mitigation. Monitoring, reporting and advocacy on violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law.\n\nThe scale of protection concerns and needs is unprecedented. New needs, vastly different in type and scale, will require new responses, and the roll-out of urgent, life-saving services accompanied by the establishment of new systems and coordination structures to ensure the most vulnerable are not left behind. The UN Human Rights OPT Office, along with partners, continues to strengthen its protection capacity and as space opens, there will be need to expand protection services and responses in various locations across the Gaza strip.\n---\nDEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA : An aerial view of debris of destroyed al-Bashir Mosque following the Israeli attacks in Hakar al-Jami area of Deir al-Balah, Gaza, Apr 2024. \u00a9Ashraf Amra / ANADOLU / Anadolu via AFP\n\nData Lead for the UN\n\nUN Human Rights Office OPT is responsible for the official compilation, verification and reporting of verified UN data on civilian fatalities. The Office serves a critical role in Gaza and the West Bank to monitor, document, and report on violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including conflict- related fatalities, to ensure accurate, reliable, and timely information and legal analysis is available aimed at guiding protection responses, preventing further violations, and ensuring accountability. The prompt monitoring work feeds directly into the overall contextual analysis of the crisis in the OPT and serves as early warning, guiding the Humanitarian Coordinator, the UN Humanitarian Country Team and through it, the UN leadership, and the UN system as a whole.\n\nDespite extreme challenges on the ground, and the enormous scale of violations, the Office is scaling up its monitoring capacity, both in Gaza and the West Bank, to continue to fulfil its human rights monitoring and reporting mandate. The Office has documented hundreds of cases of alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, in Gaza and the West Bank including East Jerusalem. The Office provides statements and briefings, which contain strong factual and legal analysis of rapidly unfolding events, to Member States and top UN officials on the situation in the OPT.\n\nTrusted Reliable Partner Following a major Israeli military offensive in Gaza in late 2008/early 2009, the UN Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner to strengthen the Office,\n\nto engage in the monitoring of the human rights situation in the OPT, and to provide periodic public reports of the Office\u2019s findings to the UN Human Rights Council and UN General Assembly. As such, the UN Human Rights OPT Office is the only international organization with a formal mandate to monitor and publicly report on the human rights situation in the OPT, and since then, the Office has acted as a reliable, impartial source of information for Member States, in their advocacy efforts with all duty-bearers, and for the international community more broadly. This function is particularly crucial to dispel any misinformation and disinformation, and to encourage addressing unfolding events through a human rights lens.\n\nUN Human Rights continues to remain highly operational and engaged in the OPT and continues to monitor and operate across the territory to the full extent of its capacity and effectively communicates up-to-date findings. The crisis demonstrates the vital importance of UN Human Rights\u2019 objective monitoring and reporting in the OPT and leading the Humanitarian Protection Cluster.\n\nAs indicated above, when the situation allows, the Office aims to have at least two presences in Gaza - Rafah and Gaza City, and one in Northern West Bank. The Office will continue to scale up its role as lead of the Protection Cluster, vital to ensure protection services are mobilized across the OPT and that protection and respect for international human rights and international humanitarian law are an integral part of the work of the Humanitarian Country Team. The scale of the crisis and the operational challenges, including re-establishing UN Human Rights offices in Gaza, and expanding in the West Bank, the rotation of staff in and out of Gaza, increased logistical needs and the necessity for additional staff capacity, have all driven up the UN Human Rights OPT Office\u2019s budget.\n---\nThe Office\u2019s priority is to secure the safety of its staff whilst remaining operational. The Office remains on the ground in the OPT, committed to stay and monitor and report on the situation and coordinate the Protection Cluster where access and security allow \u2013 a protection and human rights voice and focus need to be maintained.\n\nWhen the situation allows, the UN Human Rights Office will also cooperate with development actors to coordinate foreseen support for national institutions and civil society focusing on human rights-based approaches to recovery; strengthen links and coordination mechanisms with other non-humanitarian actors, and thus reinforce collective humanitarian and development outcomes and advance the recovery process. In this regard UN Human Rights will inter alia build on the successes and experiences of human rights treaty implementation with the Palestinian government to ensure a human rights-based approach is applied in all recovery processes.\n\nAligned to Humanitarian Principles UN Human Rights is committed to supporting all those affected, in accordance with the humanitarian principles: Humanity by protecting and ensuring respect for rights holders. Neutrality by adhering to the Office\u2019s mandate and always remaining neutral during the conflict. Impartiality by providing support to those most in need during the conflict. Independence by always working autonomously from political, economic, military or other objectives.\n---\nWinter impact on internally displaced Palestinians in shelters in Rafah, Gaza, Feb 2024. \u00a9Media Clinic\n\nContributions Will Result In:\n\nPreventing violations and strengthening protection\n\nEnhanced prevention and protection of vulnerable groups.

Movement restrictions, suspended permits for Palestinian workers entering Israel, and ongoing Israeli operations in Gaza and the West Bank have drastically impacted economic activities, leading to a 32 percent drop in Palestine\u2019s GDP in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. All major sectors saw declines, including a 34 percent drop in mining, manufacturing, electricity, and water (27 percent in the West Bank, 94% in Gaza), and a 49 percent fall in construction. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing decreased by 29 percent (11 percent in the West Bank and 93 percent in Gaza), while wholesale and retail trade, along with repair services for motor vehicles and motorcycles, contracted by 28 percent. From the third quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2024, Palestine's GDP decreased by 33 percent, from 4,018 million USD to 2,690 million USD. The West Bank's economy shrank by 22 percent while Gaza's economy collapsed by 86 percent, highlighting the severe impact of the conflict on economic activities, particularly in Gaza, exacerbating the existing fiscal and humanitarian crisis. INFLATION AND MARKET PRICES the onset of the conflict, the Consumer Price Index* (CPI) in Palestine has surged, driven primarily by price hikes in Gaza. As of August, the overall CPI increased by 51 percent compared to pre-conflict levels and 53 percent compared to August 2023. The Food CPI rose by 43 percent from pre-conflict levels and 37 percent year-on-year. In the West Bank, market prices increased moderately, with the CPI rising by 1 percent since September 2023 and 3 percent year-on- year. In contrast, Gaza\u2019s CPI skyrocketed by 244 percent since the conflict's start, though it saw a slight 2 percent decline in August. The Food CPI in Gaza climbed by 133 percent, despite a 4 percent decrease since June. Since CPI in Palestine September 2023-August 2024The All major sectors saw declines, including a 34 percent LABOR FORCE & UNEMPLOYMENT Aid In the West Bank, the rate of employed people saw a sharp decline of 27 percent between the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Employment numbers dropped from approximately 868,000 to 632,000* due to significant job losses in key sectors such as commerce, restaurants, hotels, mining, manufacturing, and construction. The unemployment rate surged to 35 percent in early 2024, compared to 13 percent before the conflict. Additionally, the number of West Bank people working in Israel and Israeli settlements dropped from 178,000 to just 33,000. In Gaza, the ongoing conflict and widespread destruction have rendered labor market monitoring nearly impossible. According to available information, employment is limited to a small number of people working for non-governmental organizations and informal traders operating in streets and shops. The destruction of infrastructure and the halting of most economic activities have left most of the population without formal employment opportunities, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis POVERTYIn In the West Bank, the rate of employed people Aid saw a sharp decline of 27 percent between the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.

Additionally, the number of West Bank people working in Israel and Israeli settlements dropped from 178,000 to just 33,000. Aid MEB AND SMEBAccording In August 2024, the rising prices in the West Bank led to a 5 percent increase in the cost of the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB), with the total value reaching 2,163 NIS compared to the original cost of MEB. Notably, the food component saw the most significant change, rising by 14 percent, with prices increasing from 680.87 NIS to 774 NIS. This sharp rise in food prices is the largest contributor to the overall increase in the MEB. Other components such as shelter,\n\neducation, and energy also saw modest increases. In July 2024, the cost of the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) in Gaza Strip experienced a significant increase of 55 percent compared to the original value, with the total value rising from 1,717 NIS to 2,665 NIS. The most striking increase occurred in the food component, where prices rose by 176 percent, increasing from NIS to 1,595 NIS. This substantial rise in food prices was the largest driver of the overall MEB cost hike.\n\n*PCBC: https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_QNAQ22024E.pdf **https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/ce9fed0d3bb295f0363d690224d1cd39-0280012024/original/Palestinian-Econ-Upd-May2024-FINAL-ENGLISH-Only.pdf (The Cash Working Group)\n\nPage 2\n---\nMarket Monitor - palestine WFP Palestine Food Security Analysis October 2024 SITUATION AND PRICES - WEST BANK Despite the ongoing conflict and movement restrictions, the West Bank\u2019s market remains functional. Basic food commodities are available in the market, with staple food sufficient for up to six months according to the Ministry of National Economy. Though logistical challenges persist, the West Bank market has managed to maintain access to essential supplies. While prices of certain goods have risen, the overall availability of staple foods has helped ensure stability in the market, contrasting with more severe disruptions in Gaza Strip.

The firewood still the main energy source used for cooking with high prices, due the limited availability of gas. In Deir Al-Balah and Khan Younis, most goods come from wholesalers, primarily imported items, while northern areas have a mix of imported, local production, and humanitarian assistance. Vendors struggle with restocking due to lack of stock, cash shortages, high costs, and expensive transportation. In the northern governorates, wheat flour and canned food are the only food items readily available in the market.

Nearly two-thirds of residents in North Gaza and Gaza governorates, and half of those in Deir Al-Balah and Khan Younis, reported difficulties. The main barriers to market access include a shortage of cash and the high prices of goods, which not only limit people's ability to buy essential items but also exacerbate the overall food insecurity crisis. This issue goes beyond the availability of food, as it is closely tied to affordability and logistical access to markets.\n\nTHE STRUGGLES OF GAZA'S MARKET: VOICES FROM THE GROUND\n\nGaza's market is facing significant challenges that threaten its stability. A primary issue is the urgent need for cash liquidity, with traders calling for financial support to sustain their businesses, protect them from exploitation, and improve overall market functionality. As one vendor put it: \u201cPlease support us so we can survive and protect us from the \u2018war traders\u2019 who are exploiting these difficult times.\u201d Access to essential supplies, including food and non-food items, remains a critical concern. Traders are advocating for the ability to import products from both within and outside Gaza to restock their shelves and meet the community's needs. \"We hope to bring in more goods so that everyone can buy,\" one trader explained. However, many traders operate under harsh conditions, such as unreliable electricity from broken solar panels, complicating daily operations. Due to the instability, they can only bring in small quantities of goods daily, lacking proper storage facilities. Price fluctuations, driven by scarcity and inflation, make long-term planning difficult. Goods are often purchased and sold on the same day, even at lower prices, because \"there is no place for storage.\" One vendor, who sells bread, reported selling sugar at three different prices in a single day due to market volatility. Those dealing in imported goods, detergents, and construction materials face additional challenges as costs rise. The disruption in aid distribution further exacerbates the situation, causing price instability and leading traders to \"not risk buying a large stock for fear of a sudden price drop.\" The market now heavily relies on frozen goods, as one stall owner noted: \"We only have frozen chicken wings and liver, as the markets now solely depend on frozen goods.\" This reliance is due to the breakdown of the cold and frozen supply chains in Gaza. Fresh produce, such as vegetables, often cannot be stored properly because of the electricity shortage, forcing vendors to sell it immediately. The scarcity of goods is increasingly evident, with many vendors lamenting the lack of fresh produce, shoes, and even winter clothing. Pharmacies are also struggling, with shelves emptied of many critical medications. A pharmacist shared, \"The shortage is clear, with large amounts of essential medicines missing.\" Despite the chaos, some vendors remain resilient, cautiously preparing to resume full operations. However, as one vendor stressed, \"We need telecommunications companies and other services to fully function again so we can rebuild.\" The prolonged instability has taken a toll on businesses and diminished the hope of many traders, who are disheartened by the rising prices and the spoilage of goods before they can be sold. Gaza's market is in a precarious state. Traders are navigating a landscape marked by price volatility, restricted access to supplies, and a lack of basic infrastructure. They are urgently calling on international organizations to help stabilize the situation by providing essential goods and financial aid. Only through a coordinated effort can the markets\u2014and the people who rely on them\u2014find a path to recovery.\n\nWe need telecommunications companies and other services to fully function again so we can rebuild.
