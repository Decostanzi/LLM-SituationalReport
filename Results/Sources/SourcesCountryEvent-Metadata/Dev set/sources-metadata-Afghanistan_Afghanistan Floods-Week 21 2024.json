Since 2021, 35% of girls in Afghanistan have been forced into marriage before the age of 18, and 17% before the age of 15.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has stated that forced marriages in South Asia, including Afghanistan, have increased due to family economic problems and the ban on education, with many families considering their daughters a \u201cburden.\u201d",

        "content": "title: Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment (MRAT) of Afghan returnees (April 2024) \n content: Executive summary\nDecades of conflict in Afghanistan have forced many people to seek refuge in neighboring countries like Pakistan and Iran. Overtime, additional drivers of movements were observed such as climate change, economic challenges, and limited livelihood opportunities. On October 3, 2023, Pakistan's Interior Ministry announced a 28-day deadline for all migrants residing illegally in the country to leave voluntarily or face deportation. This led to a widespread deportation of Afghans, with thousands being expelled from various crossing points and informally across the border. In response to these developments, The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Afghanistan devised a joint coordination framework aimed at ensuring an organized and cohesive response to the returning families in their destinations.\nThe joint framework specifically outlined the roles of the Inter-Cluster Coordination Team and Groups (ICCT/ICCGs) and the Durable Solutions Working Group (DSWG) in addressing the needs of returnees in return areas, emphasizing the importance of addressing both emergency and log-term concerns coherently. This report presents the findings of the Multi-Sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment Teams (MRAT) that targeted more than 24,000 households of returnees and host population across all seven regions of Afghanistan. Regrettably, a considerable number of these households encounter notable difficulties concerning food security, financial aid, and housing. Nonetheless, the majority of families indicate their desire to stay in Afghanistan, highlighting a chance for humanitarian organizations and essential service providers to work together closely and efficiently alleviate the struggles experienced by the most vulnerable individuals.",

On 10 January 2024, DTM began deploying field teams at four border crossing points with the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRN) and Pakistan (PAK), expanding to another border crossing point Ghulam Khan as of 11 February (see map below for the locations of all five crossing points), to conduct two interlinked exercises. The first is a headcount of all individuals entering or leaving Afghanistan (including returnees), also called Flow Monitoring Counting (FMC), to gauge flow volume. The second is a survey of randomly selected Afghan national individuals or groups entering or leaving Afghanistan, also called the Flow Monitoring Survey (FMS), to understand the profiles, motivations, and vulnerabilities of the target population. The inflow from Pakistan increased over the monitoring period. This may be related to media reports and speculation about a potential resumption of the repatriation process, targeting primarily Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders, starting from April 15, 2024. However, according to the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs as of April 26, the repatriation process has not yet begun. Additionally, the Government of Pakistan recently extended the validity of 1.3 million PoR cards for Afghan refugees in Pakistan up to June 30, with their repatriation planned for after the repatriation of ACC holders (Voice of America News). This snapshot provides key findings combining various IOM data sources, including DTM Afghanistan\u2019s FMC and FMS activities, DTM Pakistan\u2019s Flow Monitoring of Afghan returnees, and IOM Afghanistan\u2019s Cross-Border Post-Arrival Humanitarian Assistance (CB-PAHA) program, for the period 12 to 18 May 2024.

Hence, despite a significant decrease in active conduct of hostilities across Afghanistan, widespread protection risks persist, characterized by significant protracted displacement, mine and explosive ordnance contamination, discrimination, and denial of access to services, resources and humanitarian assistance, restrictions to freedom of movement, growing threat of forced evictions, increased risks of gender-based violence (GBV), child labour, early marriage and heightened needs for mental health and psychosocial support. The protection space is shrinking and is affecting particularly women, girls, IDPs, returnees, persons living with disabilities, elderly, and other vulnerable groups. The protection risks requiring immediate attention in the period covered by this analysis are:",

Floods at the weekend in the western province of Ghor and Faryab province in the north brought further devastation and killed at least 110* people, including children.\nArshad Malik, Country Director of Save the Children Afghanistan, said:\n\u201cExtreme weather events pose a serious risk to all children in Afghanistan whose families or communities rely on farming to survive. This equates to nearly 13.2 million children or 70% of children in Afghanistan. Severe flooding and prolonged drought are increasing in frequency, and they are wiping out crops, killing livestock and drastically reducing vital food supplies and diminishing water sources.\nWe are seeing the real time effect of the climate crisis here in Afghanistan and we can\u2019t delay action. The time to act is now. The international community must prioritize support for Afghanistan\u2019s disaster response efforts and invest in long-term resilience-building initiatives to help the country prepare for the impact of more climate-related disasters in the future.\u201d\nSave the Children has been supporting communities and protecting children's rights across Afghanistan since 1976, including during periods of conflict and natural disasters.\nENDS\nWe have a spokesperson available.\nNotes\n*At least 50 people were killed as of Saturday 18 May in Ghor province, according to figures given by the de facto authorities. At least 60 people were killed in Faryab. This number is likely to change as the situation evolves.\nAccording to the de facto authorties and the World Food Programme (WFP). https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-floods-flash-update-2-floods-hit-northeastern-afghanistan-16-may-2024\nIn BANGKOK: Amy Sawitta Lefevre: amy.lefevre@savethechildren.org +6681317923\nOur media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409",

The survey is carried out by using drones and helicopters for area monitoring.BMKG's proposal will later be discussed in more detail with PVMBG, including listening to and considering other proposals submitted by academics so that the EWS is effective in meeting information needs at the community level.\"We are targeting the early warning system units' installation to be carried out this year,\" he said.\nTranslator: Muhammad Zulfikar, Raka Adji\nEditor: Azis Kurmala\nCopyright \u00a9 ANTARA 2024",

WFP diverted its already dwindling resources to support flood-affected communities with food, non-food items and nutrition support.\nWhile food security has slightly improved, Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis persists. The projected number of severely food insecure people for the next Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis is expected to drop from 15.8 million to 14.2 million by October 2024. WFP can only assist 10 million out of the projected 14.2 million with current resources.\nSituation Update\nIncessent rains in March and April have triggered floods in several districts across Afghanistan leading to fatalities, infrastructure damage and casualties. Several districts, including Nahrin, Baghlan Markazi and Burka, declared some villages inaccessible for humanitarian teams.\nThe country is plagued by decades of violent conflict, exacerbated by climate hazards. Half the population lived in poverty even before the takeover in August 2021, and the situation has only worsened since. Women and girls took another step back as new edicts disenfranchised their freedom and denied them access to education and safe spaces outside their homes.\nThe expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan has meant that more people in the country are now hungry, vulnerable, and ill-equipped to support themselves. An estimated 1.4 million Afghans from Pakistan and Iran are anticipated to return during 2024.\nThe withdrawal of international development assistance and budget support caused an economic crisis characterized by high unemployment, cash shortages, and rising food prices, plunging an estimated 97 percent of Afghans into poverty. The economic shock exacerbated structural weaknesses formed by decades of conflict and extreme climate shocks as seen by the floods-induced destruction. At the same time, the operating space for humanitarian assistance is shrinking due to the restrictive measures by the de facto authorities.\nWFP Response",

        "content": "title: Protection Interventions for Afghan Returnees from Pakistan (April 2024 to December 2025) \n content: Introduction\nIn the wake of prolonged conflict and displacement in Afghanistan, many civil society organizations and community structures in return areas have dissolved. It is thus imperative to prioritize investment in communities and empower displaced and returnee populations to take ownership of their own protection. Embedding protection work within the communities, including among returnees, contributes to the sustainability of interventions and peaceful coexistence, a key factor facilitating their reintegration. Upon their return, returnees often grapple with limited resources, information and barriers to accessing basic needs and services, given that knowledge around this is primarily embedded within community-based structures.\nEconomic hardship and limited livelihood opportunities stemming from the ongoing humanitarian crises are exacerbating protection risks for the affected populations. The influx of Afghan returnees from Pakistan added significant strain to already deteriorated protection services. Through protection monitoring, humanitarian stakeholders are observing increased numbers of affected families adopting negative coping mechanisms, which result in further exploitation of vulnerable groups, especially children. Increased pressure on the host communities not only compromises their ability to welcome Afghan returnees, but also exacerbates the overall protection environment in Afghanistan for displaced people, returnees and host communities alike. Women and girls, constrained by severe restrictions of movement and participation in education, employment or public life, face particular challenges in meeting their basic needs. They often rely on family or community networks to access aid, services and information.\nReturnees have often experienced rights\u2019 violations by different actors during these journeys and remain particularly susceptible to harm given their precarious situation and limited support available in areas of returns. While multi-sectorial services are accessible at border points, such provisions are ad-hoc and are not as systematized in return areas. Therefore, establishing entry points for protection response, such as through protection information desks and integrated services with livelihoods, legal aid and health are essential to mitigate risks and deliver a comprehensive response to address the protection needs of returnees.",

The contribution will address the immediate needs of those affected, and be used for food, emergency shelter, emergency trauma care, non-food items as well as water, sanitation and hygiene items. The aid will directly enhance the relief efforts led by our Red Cross Red Crescent partners on the ground, including the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).\nSRC has also launched a public fundraising appeal to further support relief and recovery operations in Afghanistan.\n\u201cWe are saddened by the loss of lives, injuries, and the impact on homes and livelihoods due to the flash floods. We are working closely with our partners from the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement to stay updated on the situation. As we commence our fundraising efforts, we hope the people of Singapore will stand in solidarity with us, to support the communities-in-need,\u201d said Mr Benjamin William, Secretary General/CEO of the Singapore Red Cross.\nCurrently, ARCS is providing immediate assistance to those displaced, including evacuation, establishment of temporary shelters, and the provision of mobile emergency health services delivering crucial first aid. The IFRC has dispatched emergency response teams to support relief operations and is continuously assessing the needs on the ground.\nOn 10 May 2024, several provinces of northern Afghanistan were hit by heavy rains, resulting in severe flash floods resulting in more than 300 fatalities, with more than 1,600 injured. The number of casualties is expected to rise. The deluge led to the destruction of over 3,000 homes, extensive damage to roads and bridges, and significant losses of livestock and agricultural land. Challenging terrains and damaged infrastructure have hampered relief operations and efforts to reach areas in need of assistance, which were already vulnerable due to landslides, flooded roads and fragile infrastructure. The 10 May 2024 flash floods intensified the flooding across the Northeast region of Afghanistan that has been ongoing since 16 April 2024. The combination and accumulation of these floods have caused severe humanitarian needs in this region. A total of 25 provinces (out of 34 provinces in Afghanistan) have been impacted by floods.

This roadmap represents a unified vision detailing strategies and initiatives aimed at empowering affected individuals and ensuring equitable access to healthcare services.\nThe Health Cluster organized a three-day training on minimum standards in two batches: the first batch on 28-30 April, and the second batch on the 29-30 April-01 May. The training was organized in coordination with the AAP Working Group , Gender in Humanitarian Action (GiHA) Working Group, the Disability Inclusion Working Group (DIWG), the Protection Cluster, and the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) network, highlighting a collaborative effort to enhance humanitarian response standards. In the first batch, there were 35 participants representing 32 organizations, while the second batch had 31 participants from 28 organizations.\nThe Health Cluster planned to organize data management training for Health Cluster partners across seven regions. As of 30 April, the training had been conducted in northeastern, northern and central regions, offering a comprehensive three-day program. In Kunduz, in the northeastern region, 22 participants attended (3 female, 19 male), representing 11 organizations. In Balkh, in the northern region, there were 20 participants (3 female, 17 male) from 13 organizations. Meanwhile, in Kabul, in the central region, 17 participants (all male) joined from 15 organizations.\nRegional Health Cluster coordination teams have collaborated with health partners across all seven regions (eastern, southern, southeastern, western, northern, northeastern, and central). Their activities encompass regular and ad hoc coordination meetings with relevant authorities and health partners, and undertaking joint missions with the partners, and UN agencies to monitor the health response.\nBetween 01 November 2023 and 29 April 2024, a total of 25 Health Cluster partners supported the health response to returnees. The partners involved were: AADA, AFGA, ARCS, BARAN, HEALTHNET TPO, HEWAD, HMLO, INTERSOS, IOM, IRC, IRW, JACK, MEDAIR, MMRCA, OHPM, ORCD, PU-AMI, SCA, SCI, TDH, WORLD, WVI, UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO. However, in April 2024, 12 Health Cluster partners (AADA, HMLO, IOM, IRW, JACK, OHPM, PU-AMI, SCI, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, and WORLD) were involved in the response activities.",

        "content": "title: Afghanistan Floods: Flash Update #1 - Floods hit the Northern and Western Regions of Afghanistan (20 May 2024 ) \n content: Highlights\n\u2022 On 17 and 18 May, heavy rainfall caused intense flooding in Ghor province in the Western region and Faryab province in the Northern region of Afghanistan.\n\u2022 Across Faryab province, early reports indicate that 84 people have been killed, 5 people injured and 40 people are missing. About 1,870 houses have been destroyed or damaged, 150 shops flooded, 700 acres of agriculture land has been washed away, 900 livestock were lost, and 30,000 vines and fruit tress destroyed.\n\u2022 Initial reports shared by humanitarian partners in Ghor province indicate approximately 50 people have been killed and hundreds of people are missing. Early unconfirmed reports indicate substantial damage to over 6,000 houses, more than 1,200 shops, as well as other critical civilian infrastructure.\n\u2022 Across both Faryab and Ghor provinces, initial reports indicate that the most immediate and pressing needs for affected households are access to food, water, shelter and NFIs.\nOverview\nOn 17 and 18 May, heavy rainfall led to flash floods in the Northern and Western regions of Afghanistan, impacting 10 districts in Ghor province (Charsada, Dawlatyar, Dolayna, Ferozkoh, Lal Wa Sarjangal, Murghab, Pasaband, Saghar, Shahrak, and Tolak districts), as well as eight districts in Faryab province (Almar, Bilcheragh, Chehlgazi, Dawlatabad, Khaibar, Maimana, Pashtun Kot and Qaysar districts). While assessments are ongoing for both provinces, initial reports indicate the large-scale floods have resulted in the deaths of at least 120 people with hundreds more people missing and extensive damage to private properties and civilian infrastructure. Humanitarian partners and local authorities anticipate the number of casualties will increase significantly as search and rescue efforts continue amid reports that people may be trapped under collapsed buildings. In northern Afghanistan, the initial flooding on 17 May in Faryab province reportedly affected around 560 households followed by a second wave of flooding on 18 May which affected approximately 1,300 households across eight districts. Affected villages in Bilcheragh and Khaiber districts are currently inaccessible due to challenging terrains and road blockages. Partners plan to access the area through Gurziwan district to continue their assessment In the Western region, humanitarian partners note that Murghab district in Ghor province is considered at high risk due to the large amounts of debris that are reportedly blocking the flow of the Murghab River and increasing the risk of additional flooding of nearby villages if the river breaks (Asfarman with 500 families, Jandak with 900 families, Pai Khaza with 50 families, Raqsan with 800 families, Shamak with 3,500 families, Shuraba with 700 families, and Shardiz with 100 families). As of today, humanitarian partners have not been able to access Murghab district with humanitarian assistance. Partners reported that in the outskirts of Chaghcharan city in Ferozkoh district, both health facilities and markets are inaccessible. Furthermore, the road from Hirat to Ghor was heavily damaged and inaccessible until Sunday night, with partners mobilizing additional resources from Kabul via accessible roads.",

To subscribe, click here.\nI'm Abubakar Siddique, senior correspondent at RFE/RL's Radio Azadi. Here's what I've been tracking and what I'm keeping an eye on in the days ahead.\nThe Key Issue\nFlash floods that have ravaged Afghanistan in recent weeks have exacerbated the hunger crisis in the country, aid agencies said.\nHundreds of people have been killed, thousands of homes destroyed, and thousands of hectares of farmland wiped out by the floods in northern Afghanistan since May 10.\nThe UN World Food Program (WFP) has warned that flooding is likely to intensify in the months ahead, with a major impact on food security.\nStephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, said flood-affected areas are \"hunger hot spots, most of which are already in crisis levels of food insecurity.\u201d\nWhy It's Important: Survivors of the floods have said they urgently need help.\n\"We need shelter and water,\u201d Tora Khan, a resident of Baghlan, told RFE/RL\u2019s Radio Azadi. \u201cDrinking water is very scarce because many wells were destroyed.\u201d\nRelief organizations have struggled to deliver aid to at least 80,000 people affected by the floods, most of them in the provinces of Baghlan and Ghor.\nWithout help, there are fears that some Afghans are likely to succumb to disease or starvation.\n\u201cWe are in dire need of water,\u201d said Mohammad Yaser, a resident of Baghlan, who added that some local charities had sent them some food and clean water.\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t know how long until we run out,\u201d Yaser told Radio Azadi. \u201cMaybe today or tomorrow.\u201d\nThe UN estimates that nearly 24 million Afghans out of a total population of 40 million need humanitarian assistance this year. The WFP said almost 16 million Afghans are acutely food insecure.\nWhat's Next: Afghanistan is one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries to climate change. Experts say extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, are spurred by climate change and likely to increase.\nThe Taliban\u2019s unrecognized government is internationally isolated and international humanitarian funding for Afghanistan has been declining.\nThat is likely to make the country ill-equipped to prepare for and react to major natural disasters.\nWhat To Keep An Eye On\nTurkish Airlines has resumed flights to Afghanistan. The airline suspended air travel to the country in the wake of the Taliban\u2019s takeover in 2021.\nTurkish Airlines said on May 21 that it will operate four flights from Istanbul to Kabul each week.\n\"I am jubilant,\" said Muska, a Kabul resident whose extended family lives in Turkey. \"Now I can visit them, and they can visit us.\u201d\nLast year, Fly Dubai became the first major airline to resume flights to Afghanistan. Air Arabia, another low-cost airline in the United Arab Emirates, also restarted flights soon after.\nWhy It's Important: Turkish Airlines flights will make it easier for members of the Afghan diaspora, which numbers around 6 million, to visit their homeland.\nThe flights will also help the isolated country connect with the rest of the world. Istanbul is a major international aviation hub.\nThat's all from me for now.\nDon't forget to send me any questions, comments, or tips that you have. You can always reach us at azadi.english@rferl.org\nUntil next time,\nAbubakar Siddique\nIf you enjoyed this briefing and don't want to miss the next edition, subscribe here.

        "title": "Afghanistan: Minutes of FSAC Monthly Meeting (24 April 2024) [Meeting Minutes]",
        "content": "title: Afghanistan: Minutes of FSAC Monthly Meeting (24 April 2024) [Meeting Minutes] \n content: The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) presented a comprehensive overview of early warning information to the cluster partners. Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n\u27a2 Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n\u27a2 Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n\u27a2 Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n\u27a2 Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. \u27a2 Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n\u27a2 Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n\u27a2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n\u27a2 Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n\u27a2 Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

They\u2019ve lost their homes, they\u2019ve lost family members.\u201d\nThe image of destruction caused by the massive flooding in the northern part of Afghanistan remains vivid in the minds of midwives Habiba Danish and Roqia Saberi. But what struck them more was the suffering of women in the affected communities that they witnessed.\nHabiba is part of a Mobile Health Team (MHT) that was immediately deployed to Baghlan to provide round-the-clock maternal health and psychosocial support services to the people affected by the devastating floods in the province.\n\u201cWe had to trek for seven hours, and stay overnight on the way to reach Pushta Kaja Village because the roads were impassable,\u201d Habiba said.\nUpon reaching the village, Habiba encountered a 25-year-old woman who is four months pregnant.\n\u201cShe was visibly distressed because her home had been destroyed, putting her family in a dire situation,\u201d Habiba recounted. \u201cAfter examining her and administering some medication prescribed by the doctor in our team, I advised her to seek further evaluation from a well-equipped health facility for an ultrasound examination.\u201d\nThe midwife has since attended to other women who needed not just maternal health care but also psychosocial support. \u201cThe women were in shock,\u201d Habiba recalled. \u201cThey've lost their homes and family members.\u201d\nThe situation has exacerbated the hardship of the local community. OCHA reports that the districts most affected by the flooding are Burka and Baghlani Jadid/Markazi in Baghlan province, where 80 per cent of deaths have been recorded. Over 3,000 homes have also been destroyed or damaged in the province.\n\u201cWomen are particularly vulnerable; they're grappling with mental distress and struggling to focus, highlighting the urgency of providing them with crucial health services,\u201d Habiba said. \u201cThe MHT remains on the ground to provide psychosocial counselling and support to help women cope with the shock, anxiety and depression. It is crucial that we stand by them during this time.\u201d\nThe MHT\u2019s presence has been instrumental in facilitating the health education and counselling sessions for women and girls. However, due to the scattered population and the impact of the flash floods on the terrain and roads, reaching them is challenging.\nRoqia Saberi, a midwife from another MHT, said the Basic Health Center (BHC) in Shaikh Jalal Village, Baghlani Markazi District, was totally destroyed, leaving people in desperate need of health services. Thus, the MHT came to deliver maternal and reproductive health services.\nOn her first day on the ground, Roqia attended to more than 20 female patients who required her assistance. \u201cNine out of the 20 women needed antenatal care support,\u201d Roqia shared. \u201cTwo of the women were in the last trimester of pregnancy and both were in shock and fear. I provided them with Clean Delivery Kits and advised them to seek further care from a well-equipped health facility.\u201d\nAside from deploying MHTs to deliver maternal and reproductive health and psychosocial counselling, UNFPA also collaborates with partners to dispatch and distribute Dignity Kits, menstrual hygiene kits, tarpaulin sheets and blankets, prioritizing the well-being of affected women and girls.\nThe MHTs, managed by ORCD Afghanistan, are committed to remaining in the flood-affected area to offer 24/7 assistance for the immediate health needs of women and girls. The MHTs, supported with funding from the Government of Australia, were able to pivot from protracted emergency work to immediately respond to the flooding situation.",

The statement came after weeks of flooding, which has effectively \u2018inundated farms and villages\u2019 and \u2018swept away swathes of communities\u2019.\n\u2018Hundreds\u2019 of people have died due to flash flooding, this month. The floods have swamped agricultural lands in a country where a staggering 80 per-cent of the population depends on farming, to survive.\nThe latest \u2018heavy floods\u2019 hit multiple districts in the Faryab province, on Saturday night. Asmatullah Muradi (a spokesman for the Faryab governor) said in a statement that the floods \u201cresulted in human and financial losses\u201d.\n\u201cDue to the floods 66 people were killed\u201d he said, adding that at least five people were injured and others were \u2018still missing\u2019.\nThe flooding caused damage to more than 1,500 houses, swamped more than 1,000 acres of agricultural land and killed hundreds of livestock, he stated. The floods came only a day after provincial police said that more than 50 people died due to flash flooding in the western province of Ghor.\nAccording to officials from the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the Taliban \u201cmore than 300 people were killed by torrents in northern Baghlan province\u201d (just over a week ago).\nTaliban officials have warned that death tolls are likely to increase in the regions impacted by flooding. Floods have \u2018destroyed infrastructure\u2019, \u2018hampered aid delivery\u2019 and \u2018efforts to find the missing\u2019.\nOn Sunday, the death toll from the flooding in Ghor rose from 50 to 55, according to Abdul Wahid Hamas, who is a spokesman for the provincial governor. \u201cMore than 3,000 homes were totally destroyed due to the floods\u201d in Ghor, he added.\nVideos posted on the social media platform \u2018X\u2019, by the WFP, showed \u2018currents of brown water crashing through walls of homes and churning through streets\u2019 in Ghor.\n\u2018Washed away our life\u2019\nResidents in Baghlan, Ghor, Faryab and other affected provinces found themselves \u2018without shelter\u2019, whilst also being \u2018stripped of their homes and livelihoods\u2019.\n\u201cWe were inside our home when rain started and all of a sudden, a flash flood came, we were trying to get things out but it washed away our home, our life, everything\u201d a resident of Ghor, Jawan Gul, told journalists\u2019 on Saturday.\nIn addition to this, the flooding \u2018sparked concern\u2019 for the revered 12th-century \u2018Jam minaret\u2019 (located in a remote part of Ghor), provincial officials stated.\nImages circulating on the countries\u2019 media showed brown torrents \u2018crashing around the base\u2019, of the Unesco World Heritage Site.\n\u201cThe situation of Jam was very concerning\u201d Abdul Hai Zaeem, the director of information and culture in Ghor, told members\u2019 of the press. He added that mud was \u2018still piled high around the brick minaret\u2019.\nThe WFP \u2018warned\u2019 that the recent floods have\u2019 compounded an already dire humanitarian situation in the impoverished country\u2019.\nSpring floods are not uncommon in Afghanistan, which is a country of more than 40 million people. However, \u2018above-average rainfall\u2019 this year has spavrked \u2018devastating flash flooding\u2019.\nEven before the most recent spate of floods, about 100 people had been killed from mid-April to early May, owing to flooding in 10 of Afghanistan\u2019s provinces\u2019, authorities stated.\nThe rains come after a prolonged period of drought in Afghanistan, which is one of the \u2018least prepared nations to tackle climate change impacts\u2019, according to experts.\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2024",

        "content": "title: Fistula survivor looks forward to reuniting with family after surgery \n content: Kabul, Afghanistan \u2013 Rahila Bibi* developed obstetric fistula when she gave birth for the sixth time last year. Her baby also did not survive the prolonged labour, resulting in a stillbirth.\nShe was in labour for three days and did not immediately go to a health facility. When she finally decided to seek professional help, it was too late.\nObstetric fistula is a hole between the birth canal and bladder and/or rectum, which commonly happens as a result of prolonged, obstructed labour without access to timely, high-quality medical treatment. It leaves women and girls leaking urine, faeces or both, and often leads to chronic medical problems, depression, social isolation and deepening poverty.\nAshamed of her condition, the 35-year-old Rahila did not tell anyone what she was going through. She isolated herself from family and friends for fear of being rejected because of the obstetric fistula. \u201cI refrained from participating in family gatherings and events, which caused me immense pain. I felt excluded from society,\u201d Rahila narrated.\nWhile she lived in isolation, Rahila also sought treatment for her condition. \u201d She visited clinics and doctors, but because she did not have money, she was unable to find a lasting treatment.\nDespite the setbacks, Rahila persisted until she learned that the Malalai Maternity Hospital in Kabul could be the answer to her prayer. \u201cOne of the doctors that I consulted with informed me that I can avail of the fistula repair surgery from Malalai Maternity Hospital in Kabul,\u201d she recalls.\nWith renewed hopes, Rahila and her husband visited the hospital in November 2023.\n\u201cShe was in a poor psychological state and distressed when she came to us,\u201d said Dr. Huma Mangal, a fistula surgeon and trainer at the hospital. \u201cAfter conducting initial examinations, it was confirmed that she had an obstetric fistula.\u201d\nAfter a series of consultations with Rahila and her husband, the couple finally agreed to proceed with the surgery that would repair her fistula.\nFurther explaining Rahila\u2019s condition, Dr. Huma said failure to seek medical assistance during childbirth and prolonged labour could lead to the foetus changing its position and failing to progress into the birth canal. \u201cThis was the unfortunate outcome for Rahila, who lost her baby and developed a vaginal fistula,\u201d Dr. Huma said.\nMalalai Maternity Hospital is one of the three hospitals in Afghanistan that has the capacity to perform fistula repair surgery. The two others are the Herat Regional Hospital and Jalalabad Regional Hospital. UNFPA had previously supported the training of doctors for fistula surgery in these hospitals and provided medical equipment for their fistula wards.\nFollowing her successful surgery, Rahila looks forward to living a normal life again.\n\u201cI feel better. I know that I will be happy again, and I can\u2019t wait to see my friends and family members,\u201d Rahila told UNFPA from her hospital bed.\nDr. Nafiza Hamrah, a fistula surgeon at Malalai Maternity Hospital, said the hospital treated 145 cases of obstetric fistula in 2023 and 80 women so far this year.\nReiterating this year\u2019s theme of \u201cBreaking the Cycle: Preventing Fistula Worldwide\u201d for the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula, Dr. Hamrah said families and communities play an important role in fistula prevention.\n\u201cWe need to educate families and communities about the importance of seeking antenatal care from skilled health providers during pregnancy and delivery,\u201d she said.\n\u201cRegrettably, obstetric fistula is a neglected and overlooked condition in society. As a healthcare professional, I urge women suffering from fistula not to feel ashamed about their inability to control urinary and hygiene issues, as this can worsen their condition,\u201d she added.\n*Name changed for privacy reasons.",

        "content": "title: UN warns of more flooding in Afghanistan \n content: As the United Nations warns of more \"intensive\" floods affecting food security in Afghanistan in the coming months, experts say the country needs long-term planning to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.\nThe U.N. said that floods in the northeastern and northwestern provinces in the past two weeks have affected more than 80,000 people in the country.\nLocal Taliban officials in the western province of Ghor said Thursday that last week's flood in the province killed at least 50 people and damaged more than 4,000 houses and shops.\nAccording to the U.N., floods on May 10 and 11 in the northeastern provinces of Badakhshan, Takhar and Baghlan killed 347 people and injured 1,651. The floods destroyed 7,800 houses, killed nearly 14,000 livestock and destroyed about 24,000 hectares of land in the three provinces.\nThe worsening climate crisis has brought about \"the erratic weather pattern,\" which has \"become the norm\" in the country, according to the World Food Program.\n\"The affected people are living in districts with higher food insecurity,\" said Ziauddin Safi, a spokesperson for WFP in Afghanistan, adding that \"the floods are caused by unusual rainfall after a dry winter that left the ground too hard to absorb the rain caused by climate crisis.\"\n\"Unfortunately, WFP expects more floods in the future,\" Safi added.\nAfghanistan remains one of the world's most vulnerable countries to climate change, though it has one of the lowest greenhouse gas emissions.\nAccording to the INFORM Risk Index 2023, the country is ranked fourth on the list of countries most at risk of a crisis.\nAfghanistan is also one of the most vulnerable and least prepared countries on the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index.\nNajibullah Sadid, an Afghan water specialist at the University of Stuttgart in Germany, told VOA that Afghanistan needs a long-term plan to mitigate the effects of climate change but that the country lacks resources.\n\"Unfortunately, without international economic support, implementing projects [to mitigate the effects of climate change] in Afghanistan is impossible,\" Sadid said.\nHe added that Afghanistan needs support from the U.N. Green Climate Fund and Loss and Damage Fund for Developing Countries.\nSadid said that Afghanistan has no capacity to prepare communities in the face of challenges caused by climate change.\nSadruddin Fakhruddin, a former Afghan official at the Ministry of Agriculture, told VOA that most of the affected people in the provinces depend on agriculture, and the floods \"washed away the agricultural land and destroyed the irrigation system.\"\nWFP has called for an additional $14.5 million to assist flood-affected people with \"emergency food and nutrition assistance and resilience-building projects.\"\nEven before the recent floods, the country was facing a humanitarian crisis.\nWFP had requested $670 million for the first six months of 2024 to reach some 16 million people who needed food assistance in Afghanistan.\nAccording to the U.N., 4 million people, including 3.2 million children under the age of 5, are malnourished in Afghanistan.\n\"Acute malnutrition is above emergency thresholds in 25 out of 34 provinces, and is expected to worsen, with almost half of children under 5 and a quarter of pregnant and breastfeeding women needing life-saving nutrition support in the next 12 months,\" according to WFP.\n\"Women and children were disproportionately affected by the floods as they were inside their homes during the heavy rains, while men sheltered in public buildings such as mosques,\" said the Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group and the Women Advisory Group to the Humanitarian Country Team.\nFakhruddin said better management of resources is needed in the long term to mitigate the adverse effects of natural disasters in Afghanistan.\n\"In the short term, food security would be important; however, in the long term, issues such as reforestation, land and water management would need to be addressed.\"",

The train carries an assortment of humanitarian aid collected in a campaign by AFAD and 17 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for flood victims in Afghanistan.\nThis is the 20th such train carrying aid for the Asian country whose economy is in tatters. The train\u2019s load includes 600 tents, food, hygiene kits, beds and blankets. In total, it carries 619 tons of aid.\nDeputy Interior Minister M\u00fcnir Karalo\u011flu, AFAD Chair Okay Memi\u015f and representatives of Turkish charities attended a ceremony to see off the train. Karalo\u011flu said in a speech that floods killed more than 400 people in Afghanistan, and T\u00fcrkiye had already sent emergency aid by plane last week.\n\u201cThis train will also carry the passion, fraternity and love of Turkish people for Afghanistan,\u201d Karalo\u011flu said.\nAFAD Chair Memi\u015f stated that they launched the aid campaign amid Afghanistan\u2019s calls for international aid. Memi\u015f noted that T\u00fcrkiye was also a leading country in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza.\nThe train, consisting of 43 cars, is expected to arrive in Afghanistan within two weeks. T\u00fcrkiye started the \u201cGoodness Train\u201d series of campaigns for Afghanistan following the 2022 turmoil which saw the Taliban regain power. More aid followed after earthquakes hit Afghanistan last year and after a series of floods in 2022. So far, a total of 8,241 tons of aid have been sent to the Asian country.\nFresh floods killed 66 people in northern Afghanistan, a provincial official said last Sunday, after weeks of flooding that has inundated farms and villages and swept away swathes of communities.\nHundreds of people have died in flash floods this month that have also swamped agricultural lands in a country where 80% of the population depends on farming to survive. The latest heavy floods hit multiple districts of Faryab province on Saturday night and \"resulted in human and financial losses,\" said Asmatullah Muradi, spokesperson for the Faryab governor, in a statement. \"Due to the floods 66 people were killed,\" he said, adding that at least five people were injured and others were still missing.\nThe flooding damaged more than 1,500 houses, swamped more than 1,000 acres of agricultural land and killed hundreds of livestock, he said. The floods came a day after provincial police said more than 50 people were killed in flash flooding in the western province of Ghor.\nAbout two weeks ago, more than 300 people were killed by torrents in northern Baghlan province, according to the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) and Taliban officials. Taliban officials have warned the tolls would go up in regions impacted by flooding, as destroyed infrastructure hampered aid delivery and efforts to find the missing. The death toll from the Ghor flooding rose from 50 to 55 on Sunday, according to Abdul Wahid Hamas, a spokesman for the provincial governor. \"More than 3,000 homes were totally destroyed due to the floods\" in Ghor, he added.\nVideos shared on social media platform X by the WFP showed currents of brown water crashing through walls of homes and churning through the streets in Ghor.\nResidents in Baghlan, Ghor, Faryab and other affected provinces found themselves without shelter, stripped of their homes and livelihoods. \"We were inside our home when the rain started and all of a sudden, a flash flood came. We were trying to get things out but it washed away our home, our life, everything,\" Ghor resident Jawan Gul told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Saturday.\nThe flooding also sparked concern for the revered 12th-century Jam minaret, located in a remote part of Ghor, provincial officials said.\nImages circulated to the media showed brown torrents crashing around the base of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. \"The situation of Jam was very concerning,\" Abdul Hai Zaeem, information and culture director in Ghor, told AFP, adding that mud was still piled high around the brick minaret.\nThe WFP warned that the recent floods have compounded an already dire humanitarian situation in the impoverished country. Spring floods are not uncommon in Afghanistan, a country of more than 40 million people, but above-average rainfall this year has sparked devastating flash flooding.\nEven before the most recent spate of floods, about 100 people had been killed from mid-April to early May as a result of flooding in 10 of Afghanistan's provinces, authorities said.\nThe rains come after a prolonged drought in Afghanistan, which is one of the least prepared nations to tackle climate change impacts, according to experts.",

        "content": "title: Afghanistan: Stronger prevention measures needed amid measles surge \n content: Doctors Without Borders is calling for early vaccinations to combat a worrying spike in measles cases.\nIn a bed at Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Hospital in Afghanistan\u2019s Balkh province, 10-month-old Bilal undergoes treatment for measles and pneumonia as his mother Zakia watches.\nWhen Bilal fell ill with a fever, Zakia took him to one privately-run clinic after another, but his condition got worse.\n\"In the beginning, he had a severe fever, and despite taking him to two private medical facilities, they could not pinpoint what exactly was making him sick,\u201d says Zakia. \u201cAt first they suspected he had pneumonia and gave him some medication, but he did not show any improvement.\" In fact, her son\u2019s condition worsened.\nWhen she traveled to Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Hospital in the provincial capital, Bilal was diagnosed with measles. He was admitted to the MSF-supported measles isolation unit and then to intensive care, where his condition deteriorated further. Three days later, he is showing signs of improvement. \u201cToday, he slept well for the first time since falling ill,\u201d says Zakia.\nAnother mother, Zahra, keeps her eyes on her 10-month-old son, Ali Ramin, in the back of an ambulance while journeying from Bala Dara-i-Suf District in Samangan province to Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Hospital. \"He received treatment in the local hospital for several days, but as his condition deteriorated, we rushed here,\" Zahra says. Ali Ramin\u2019s condition is also improving.\nA worrying spike in measles cases in several provinces\nIn the first four months of 2024, Doctors Without Borders saw a surge in measles cases in facilities our teams run or support in three provinces of Afghanistan, affecting babies and young children. Cases of measles are reported annually in Afghanistan, but this year\u2019s spike in Balkh, Herat, and Helmand provinces is particularly concerning.\nBetween January and April, our teams treated almost 5,000 children for suspected measles: 2,700 at Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Hospital, 836 at Herat Regional Hospital in Herat province, and 1,406 at Boost Provincial Hospital in Helmand province. Four out of five of those admitted in Herat were under the age of one.\nIn Herat, we nearly doubled the number of beds in the isolation unit from 31 to 61. The measles isolation unit in Mazar-i-Sharif was running at more than 200 percent capacity between January and March, forcing children to share beds at times.\nAn MSF nurse checks the vital signs of five-year-old Hamid in the MSF-supported measles isolation ward at Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Hospital. Afghanistan 2024 \u00a9 Tasal Khogyani/MSF\nEarly vaccination is essential\nBilal and Ali Ramin are some of the lucky ones. Although it is a common childhood disease, measles can be deadly when complicated by other health issues such as malnutrition or congenital conditions. In the Doctors Without Borders measles isolation unit at Herat Regional Hospital, between 7 and 8 percent of children admitted for suspected measles in the first three months of this year ended up dying.\nBabies are particularly vulnerable to the disease, as children in Afghanistan do not receive their first dose of measles vaccine until they are nine months old. Zakia had not yet taken Bilal to be vaccinated when he fell sick, thinking he was still too young.\nSince mid-April, the number of children admitted with suspected measles to facilities run by or supported by Doctors Without Borders has started falling, and our teams are hopeful that this peak is over. But to reduce future cases and deaths among young infants, the first dose of the measles vaccine can be given at six months old and there must be a sustained effort to vaccinate every child in Afghanistan against the disease.\n\u201cOur main priority is to treat sick patients, but this is not enough,\u201d says MSF medical coordinator Dr. Piex Uwiragiye. \u201cThe best way to combat measles is prevention through vaccination. We are already vaccinating all eligible children who come to us, but more needs to be done to prevent the further spread of the disease. We recommend that the reactive vaccination age in Afghanistan be expanded to cover children from the age of six months, who are currently left out, despite being disproportionately affected.\u201d\nAbout our measles response in Afghanistan\nDoctors Without Borders teams are currently supporting the Ministry of Public Health by treating patients with suspected measles in three locations. At Mazar-i-Sharif Regional Hospital, we help manage a 36-bed isolation unit, donate medical supplies, and provide financial support to local health workers. We manage a 61-bed isolation unit at Herat Regional Hospital, and at Boost Provincial Hospital in Lashkar Gah, Helmand province, we support the isolation unit and treat measles patients.",

Large scale infrastructure damage is reported, including structural damage to vital bridges and roads. Many locations remain inaccessible for humanitarian teams.\n\nVerified reports of household level damage and loss from the flood events of 10-17 May are up to around 9000 homes, across Baglan, Takhar, Badakshan, Ghor, Heart and Mazar provinces.\n\nCasualties, already high at around 540 dead and injured, are expected to go up as areas become accessible. Joint Assessment teams are in the field and reporting back on priority locations, scale and impact. Initial reports note that Food assistance, Emergency shelter, and Access to clean water are among the priority needs.\n\nPEOPLE PLANNED FOR THE RESPONSE (PEOPLE IN NEED)\n\n80,000\n\nSAVING LIVES\n\nCHANGING LIVES\n\nPEOPLE PLANNED FOR RESILIENCE PROGRAMMING\n\nWFP response: WFP has been responding to a series of floods across the country since March. Recent high intensity rains have wreaked havoc in their path with devastating consequences to lives, livelihoods and infrastructure, adding significant unexpected caseloads to our contingency planning.\n\nAhead of the rains and triggered by its early warning system, WFP activated its contingency response plan, prepositioning food stocks in Herat and Mazar. Through this, WFP has responded with an immediate distribution to accessible affected households of high-energy biscuits, a nutritional supplement, and subsidised bread rations. This will be followed by the provision of food and nutrition assistance (100 percent ration for two months), with a reduced distribution (at 50 percent) for the remaining four months. Resilience activities will also be incorporated into the recovery programme, targeted in affected communities to mediate further loss.\n---\nEmergency Food and Nutrition Assistance (in-kind or cash)\n\nOn 10 May, WFP mobilized its area office within three hours of the floods to dispatch and distribute fortified biscuits to flood-affected populations and lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) for blanket distribution in all affected locations. Subsidised bread rations were also provided. Blanket food assistance has been distributed to affected populations in all areas currently accessible.\n\nTo support these efforts, WFP is erecting and replacing rub-halls (also known as mobile storage units), serving as hubs for WFP and other agencies. Additionally, new rub-halls for storage purposes are being set up and allocated where possible, with food trucks en-route to the second hub.\n\nWFP carefully assesses whether food or cash assistance is appropriate based on the specific needs of the affected populations. From 15 May, WFP initiated its its multi-purpose cash assistance (AFN 6,400 / USD 87.7) to flood affected populations, collaborating with its partners on joint distributions. This cash assistance is designed to complement the average income of Afghani households, enabling them to meet their essential needs. WFP aims to extend Multi-Purpose Cash (MPC) support to 34,000 people, with a particular focus on women, ensuring that no one is left behind in WFP\u2019s assistance efforts.\n\nResilience\n\nTimeline of Events A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE RESPONSE TO DATE\n\nMarch\n\nWFP started to preposition commodities at its warehouses in Herat and Mazar in light of low intensity flooding triggered by its early warning system.\n\nApril-May\n\nContinuous and heavy rainfall in April and May triggers flash floods and landslides, claiming numerous lives. WFP joins the Joint Assessment Team to conduct rapid assessments of the situation and identify the needs and requirements.\n\n11-17 May\n\nWFP starts distribution of food and MPC, including high-energy biscuits reaching 14,000 flood affected populations.\n\n17 May onwards\n\nAs floods ravage the country, WFP aims to support an additional 48,000 people based on rapid assessment results. The high- intensity rains have devastated lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure, drastically increasing the demands of WFP\u2019s contingency plans.\n\nWFP is seeking to support 11,000 households in affected districts through resilience building projects, focusing on flood mitigation activities.\n\nBy incorporating a resilience perspective into the recovery of flood affected communities, WFP ensures that people can rebuild better and sustainably after disasters. Thanks to WFP\u2019s early warning and preparedness systems, WFP was able to respond immediately to flood affected populations.\n\nFunding situation\n\nWFP is currently using its available resources to respond to this emergency amidst resource constraints. However, this response inevitably diverts attention and resources from existing and already reduced responses, including returnees from Pakistan and Iran.\n\nThe biggest threat to humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan remains the declining funding with WFP already responding to multiple emergencies at a reduced rate. Donor investments have helped to avert famine, but continued decline means there is a risk to losing the gains made over the last two years.\n\nWFP requires USD 14.5 million over the next seven months to reach at least 80,000 people through in-kind food assistance, cash-based transfers, nutrition activities and 80.000 people for six-month under the resilience programme.\n\n* Numbers of those needing assistance are projected to rise up to July based on the country based zonal rain pattern see . 20240510-Before-the-Deluge-FINAL pg. 13 Contact: Head of Partnerships and Reports, Afghanistan janerose.alvers@wfp.org.

        "content": "title: Afghan Women Face Serious Challenges Amid Flooding \n content: A lack of access to toilets and sanitary products plague Afghan women in the wake of recent floods, problems worsened by cultural taboos and strict gender-separation.\nMaqsooda and her daughters now drink as little water as possible during the day. They prefer to spend hours in discomfort rather than be forced to relieve themselves where they can be seen.\n\u201cThere is no place for showering or going to the bathroom,\u201d said Maqsooda, who was forced to flee her house with her daughters when floodwater inundated the area.\nMultiple provinces in Afghanistan have declared a state of emergency over the past two weeks as flash floods tear through the country\u2019s valleys. Earlier this month, the United Nations\u2019 World Food Program estimated that flash floods had killed over 300 and left many more injured as of May 11. At least 50 more people were killed in new flooding this past weekend.\nSurvivors, especially displaced women, face numerous challenges. Many of them are living in relatives\u2019 houses.\nA lack of functioning toilets in the flooded villages is one significant, yet overlooked, issue, posing a health hazard for everyone, and particularly causing misery for women and girls. In Afghanistan, men have priority access to available facilities, and women are not allowed to use the men\u2019s toilets.\n\u201cThere are only a few toilets available. Multiple households in the village share the same facilities. We are not permitted to use the toilets our male relatives use,\u201d Maqsooda said. \u201cWe live behind the veil, how can we use the same toilet?\u201d she added, referring to the strict segregation between genders practiced in Afghanistan.\nAfghanistan is home to many conservative Muslim communities.\nWhen the sun sets, and darkness falls on the village, the women seek a secluded spot away from the neighborhood. They take turns keeping watch and warning off any approaching men. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we can do if someone decides to watch us,\u201d said Maqsooda.\n\u201cWhere can I send my daughters alone? When we squat to relieve ourselves, we fear some man might approach.\u201d\nShe expressed deep shame at having to relieve herself in the open, especially after catching a man watching her.\nThe pregnant among the displaced can\u2019t wait all day, so they relieve themselves in the floodwater.\nDr. Ghafar Khan, a volunteer in the flood-affected areas of Baghlan province, reports that many of the patients he has seen recently have developed diseases due to the lack of toilets and clean water.\n\u201cIn the past three days, I have treated around 300 patients, many of whom exhibit symptoms of malaria, cholera, and other waterborne diseases,\u201d said Khan.\n\u201cThe lack of clean water and proper sanitation facilities are the main contributing factors to the rise in these diseases,\u201d he said.\nVolunteer doctors work tirelessly to see as many patients as possible each day, but the region faces a significant challenge due to the shortage of female doctors.\n\u201cFor critically ill female patients, families are often left with no choice but to seek help from male doctors due to the lack of female physicians,\u201d said Khan.\nWomen Struggling to Access Sanitary Products\nWomen affected by the floods are struggling to access sanitary products. Some feel uncomfortable talking about menstruation with aid providers, but women in the flood-affected areas are finding that NGO aid does not always contain sanitary products.\nFrishta, 49, from the Nahrin district of Baghlan province, said that some women need sanitary products during their period but they cannot talk about it and ask for sanitary pads.\nAfter their home was flooded, the family\u2019s belongings were destroyed. Relief organizations provided food and tents. \u201cWe had to move to a tent with our family,\u201d Frishta told The Afghan Times.\nShe said she and her relatives rushed to the tents in Baghlan at night, along with other families from flood-hit areas.\n\u201cDuring the night, without any facilities in the tents, we slept under the open sky,\u201d said Frishta. The next morning, the provincial administration and numerous volunteers and welfare organizations provided them with food and other essentials.\nBut Frishta said she had met a woman in distress, who had started her period and had no sanitary products.\nShe said she spoke to other menstruating women in the neighborhood and encouraged them to inform the authorities about their needs. She said that many felt they could not discuss such an issue and were afraid to speak up.\nFrishta said that women would turn to using pieces of cloth in lieu of proper sanitary products, but it was difficult, especially when they were covered in dust.\n\u201cAt that time, I reached out to the doctors who were in the village medical camp for those affected by the floods and informed them about the women having a menstruation cycle. The doctors said they had no sanitary products,\u201d Frishta said.\nShe said that she kept it a secret from male family members. If they found out that she discussed menstruation with doctors, it could put her in danger.\n\u201cAfter searching around and around, I was not able to find a single sanitary pad for women \u2013 while every woman needs it urgently,\u201d said Frishta.\nVolunteers say that people are hesitant to discuss menstruation due to cultural taboos.\nWe spoke to a volunteer named Shoaib who works for an aid organization in Baghlan province. We asked him why they weren\u2019t providing sanitary products to the women they were helping. Shoaib explained that he wanted to start by providing them to his own family first.\nWhen he told his mother about his plan to deliver sanitary pads to women affected by floods in Baghlan province, \u201cshe got angry and said it is shameful.\u201d Shoaib shared this story while he was delivering food to families affected by the floods.\n\u201cTalking about periods and menstrual health is still considered a taboo in the region,\u201d Shoaib said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t talk about this problem.\u201d Despite their efforts to raise awareness about hygiene kits, he and his team have faced difficulties while discussing sanitary products with the community.\nShoaib\u2019s team attempted to distribute sanitary pads to women through a team of female volunteers. \u201cThe women were hesitant to take the sanitary products from our female volunteer team. They tried to convince them as much as they could.\u201d He said one volunteer even reported facing difficulties while distributing the products among the women.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to accept that menstruation is a normal part of women\u2019s lives and to have open conversations about it,\u201d said Shoaib.\nThe names of the interviewees have been changed to protect their identities.",

        "content": "title: From Dream to Climate Action: Advancing Early Warnings for Flashfloods for All \n content: Najeebullah Saraj, former Acting Director for the Afghanistan Meteorological Department, is now a WMO Project Officer, where he plays a key role in the CREWS Afghanistan project, together with Rokhaya BA, aiming to improve early warning systems and bolster disaster resilience.\nSaraj's career began with a deep passion during his studies at the Hydrometeorological University, where he harbored ambitions of contributing to the WMO\u2014a dream he fulfilled after years of committed work with the Afghanistan Meteorological Department\nHis journey led him to a pivotal role at the WMO, operationalizing the Flash flood Guidance System (FFGS) with his team, a crucial element in early warning systems that safeguard lives and livelihoods against the devastating impacts of flash floods.\nOver a coffee chat at WMO headquarters, Saraj shared his rich experiences with Jesse Cruz, WMO Digital Media and Communication Officer. The purpose of this interview is to inform strategic discussion among WMO Members on how to Integrate the flash flood guidance system into national policies, strategies, and planning.\nInterview\nJesse: When did you first join the Afghanistan Metrological Department (AMD)?\nNajeebullah: I first joined AMD in 2014.\nJesse: Could you describe the state of AMD\u2019s early warning system when you joined?\nNajeebullah: Initially, Afghanistan's meteorological service was relatively unknown, with limited awareness of its existence. The country's meteorological observation capabilities were rudimentary, covering only about 10% of the area with basic equipment. Observations were manually recorded, and due to the absence of government-provided computers, we relied on personal laptops. Our facilities were limited, housed in an old building with scant internet access due to a few available ethernet ports.\nJesse: What responsibilities were you tasked with at AMD?\nNajeebullah: Before my arrival, data collection was manually done and logged in synoptic books, resulting in an archive filled with poorly maintained logbooks. My initial role in AMD involved digitizing these records, a task we began around 2015. We reorganized the data into a standardized Excel format from 2022 to 2014 to ensure consistency. Despite some data gaps, we managed to consolidate the archived information into a single, easily accessible location, aiding university students in their research.\nJesse: How did you first learn about the WMO?\nNajeebullah: My initial encounter with the WMO and its Flash Flood Guidance System project was met with skepticism. The concept of WMO support was new to us, and past experiences with other organizations had tempered my expectations. However, WMO's assessment of our staff's language skills, professional knowledge, and general awareness was a critical step in preparing us for the project, which promised to bring significant advancements. WMO's methodical training and infrastructure improvements marked the beginning of a transformative journey for AMD towards modernization.\nJesse: What convinced you that the FFGS project would be successful?\nNajeebullah: My conviction in the project solidified through two key experiences. The first was issuing our first successful warning, which demonstrated the system's effectiveness and our collective effort. The second, more profound realization came after the change of the government in 2021 when I assumed the role of Acting Director of Meteorology: the critical nature of weather forecasting, especially in restoring national and international flights, reinforced my belief in the project's value.\nJesse: Can you recount the experience of issuing your first warning?\nNajeebullah: Issuing our first warning was a defining moment, highlighting the potential of our early warning system to protect communities. Despite the unfortunate casualties in the identified risk area, the accuracy of our prediction was acknowledged by WMO, marking a significant achievement for our team. This event shifted my perspective on the project, enhancing my confidence in its impact and effectiveness.\nThe support from the Afghanistan President and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation was crucial in overcoming a hiring freeze and ensuring the project's success. Their commitment to investing in young talent and supporting the project's implementation underscored the national importance of our work.\nJesse: What challenges did you face after issuing the initial warning?\nNajeebullah: The initial phase was challenging, particularly in disseminating warnings through our website and Facebook. Public skepticism and negative feedback were hurdles we had to overcome. However, following a devastating flash flood in Herat province, which our alert helped mitigate, public trust in our warnings began to grow. This turning point validated our efforts and established a foundation of trust with the community.\nJesse: When did you realize the early warnings were truly making an impact?\nNajeebullah: The realization came when Kabul faced significant flooding risk, and the Afghanistan President's involvement, along with media collaboration, highlighted the effectiveness of our warnings and response. Our strategic communication, fostered by WMO training, proved essential in these successes.\nJesse: How did the transition from a WMO-supported to a nationally-supported project occur?\nNajeebullah: The transition involved extensive discussions, particularly with the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, where we found enthusiastic support. This collaboration was key in aligning the project with national needs and ensuring its successful implementation.\nJesse: Based on your experience, what was critical in persuading stakeholders to support this initiative?\nNajeebullah: Demonstrating the project's impact through real-case studies was vital in persuading stakeholders. Showcasing tangible benefits and successful outcomes helped to build confidence in the project's value and sustainability, highlighting its potential as a model for other countries.\nJesse: Any final thoughts?\nNajeebullah: This journey has been a dream come true for me, emphasizing the project's humanitarian goal of saving lives through improved early warning systems and disaster management. The focus on training and empowering local staff aligns with our strategy for sustainable improvement and self-reliance, ensuring the project's lasting impact.\nIn conclusion, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Fatih Kaya from the WMO for his crucial role in implementing the project. Additionally, my gratitude goes to both the WMO and USAID/BHA for their collaboration and support.",

The descriptive experiences and perceptions shared were analysed with Artificial Intelligence using natural language processing for semantic similarities and patterns.\n\nThe analysis done with a word count of over 34,554, found 12 detailed clusters shown in the diagram below. These 12 clusters can be broadly categorized into experiences leaving Pakistan, specific vulnerabilities in the household and requests for support to meet needs in Afghanistan. Amongst the 12 clusters, shelter and food needs, bribes paid, need for services other than protection and experiences of being arrested, were the top four most highlighted, compared to, shelter and food needs, experiences of being arrested, need for services other than protection and harassment by authorities in early May.\n\nThe top highlighted clusters vary with documentation status. For UNHCR Slip holders specifically, paying bribes was the most highlighted cluster followed by shelter and food needs and experiences of being arrested. For those without documentation, in need of support other than Protection services was the most frequently mentioned followed by female heads of households at risk. The later was also the most frequently mentioned by all women heads of household.\n\nExperience leaving Pakistan Shelter and Food Needs 19%\n\nHousehold vulnerabilities Support needs\n\n|    | 0            | 1                                     |\n|----|--------------|---------------------------------------|\n|  0 | Arrested 12% | Harassed/threatened by authorities 9% |\n\nBribes Paid 13%\n\nIn need of service other than protection 12%\n\n|    | 0                               | 1                             |\n|----|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|  0 | Financial Assistance Request 8% | Health Issues & Disability 7% |\n\n|    | 0                                   | 1                                                                        | 2                                                       |\n|----|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|  0 | Female head of household at risk 7% | Support for livelihoods or finding a job 4% Political protection risk 4% | Minor or older person at risk 4% Documentation issue 1% |\n\nUNHCR Comprehensive Overview of Response to Emergencies | rbapdima@unhcr.org\n\nPublished 24 May 2024 | Page 4",

        "content": "title: Afghanistan Floods: Flash Update #1 Floods hit the Northern and Western Regions of Afghanistan \n content: Afghanistan Floods: Flash Update #1 Floods hit the Northern and Western Regions of Afghanistan\n\n20 May 2024\n\nHighlights\n\nOn 17 and 18 May, heavy rainfall caused intense flooding in Ghor province in the Western region and Faryab province in the Northern region of Afghanistan.\n\nAcross Faryab province, early reports indicate that 84 people have been killed, 5 people injured and 40 people are missing. About 1,870 houses have been destroyed or damaged, 150 shops flooded, 700 acres of agriculture land has been washed away, 900 livestock were lost, and 30,000 vines and fruit tress destroyed.\n\nInitial reports shared by humanitarian partners in Ghor province indicate approximately 50 people have been killed and hundreds of people are missing. Early unconfirmed reports indicate substantial damage to over 6,000 houses, more than 1,200 shops, as well as other critical civilian infrastructure.\n\nAcross both Faryab and Ghor provinces, initial reports indicate that the most immediate and pressing needs for affected households are access to food, water, shelter and NFIs.\n\nOverview\n\nOn 17 and 18 May, heavy rainfall led to flash floods in the Northern and Western regions of Afghanistan, impacting 10 districts in Ghor province (Charsada, Dawlatyar, Dolayna, Ferozkoh, Lal Wa Sarjangal, Murghab, Pasaband, Saghar, Shahrak, and Tolak districts), as well as eight districts in Faryab province (Almar, Bilcheragh, Chehlgazi, Dawlatabad, Khaibar, Maimana, Pashtun Kot and Qaysar districts). While assessments are ongoing for both provinces, initial reports indicate the large-scale floods have resulted in the deaths of at least 120 people with hundreds more people missing and extensive damage to private properties and civilian infrastructure. Humanitarian partners and local authorities anticipate the number of casualties will increase significantly as search and rescue efforts continue amid reports that people may be trapped under collapsed buildings.\n\nIn northern Afghanistan, the initial flooding on 17 May in Faryab province reportedly affected around 560 households followed by a second wave of flooding on 18 May which affected approximately 1,300 households across eight districts. Affected villages in Bilcheragh and Khaiber districts are currently inaccessible due to challenging terrains and road blockages. Partners plan to access the area through Gurziwan district to continue their assessment.\n\nThe mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to Coordinate the global emergency response to save lives and protect people in humanitarian crises. We advocate for effective and principled humanitarian action by all, for all. www.unocha.org\n---\nOCHA Afghaistan | 2\n\nIn the Western region, humanitarian partners note that Murghab district in Ghor province is considered at high risk due to the large amounts of debris that are reportedly blocking the flow of the Murghab River and increasing the risk of additional flooding of nearby villages if the river breaks (Asfarman with 500 families, Jandak with 900 families, Pai Khaza with 50 families, Raqsan with 800 families, Shamak with 3,500 families, Shuraba with 700 families, and Shardiz with 100 families). As of today, humanitarian partners have not been able to access Murghab district with humanitarian assistance. Partners reported that in the outskirts of Chaghcharan city in Ferozkoh district, both health facilities and markets are inaccessible. Furthermore, the road from Hirat to Ghor was heavily damaged and inaccessible until Sunday night, with partners mobilizing additional resources from Kabul via accessible roads.\n\nHumanitarian Needs and Response\n\nEducation: Most education facilities in Ghor Province have been damaged. The Provincial Education Directorate (PED) reported 62 schools (six in Charsada, 10 in Dawlatyar, 15 in Ferozkoh, four in Lal Wa Sarjangal, five in Murghab, four in Pasaband, three in Saghar, nine in Shahrak, and six in Tolak districts) have been severely damaged and many community-based education (CBE) classes affected with number yet to be confirmed.\n\nEmergency Shelter (ES) / Non-food Items (NFI): Partners have reported that floods have destroyed or damaged over 6,000 homes in Ghor province. For Faryab, the Shelter cluster partners report sufficient NFI stock, with additional tents required in Maimana district to respond to affected households. Additionally, at least one partner has confirmed the availability of funds for multi-purpose cash assistance.\n\nFood Security and Agriculture (FSAC): In Faryab province, FSAC partners provided food assistance to 2,508 people across the affected areas. FSAC partners also provided cash for food to 224 people in Bilcheragh, Khwaja Sabz Posh, and Qaysar districts. In-kind food assistance has been distributed to 1,050 people in Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, Dawlat Abad, Bilcheragh, Gurziwan, Pashtun Kot, and Khwaja Sabz Posh districts. In the coming days, FSAC partners plan to reach flood-affected people in the districts of Maimana, Qaysar, Almar, Dawlat Abad, Bilcheragh, Gurziwan, Pashtun Kot, Khwaja Sabz Posh, Ferozkoh, Charsada, Pasaband, Shahrak, Tolak, and Saghar. With the road from Hirat to Ghor reopened a regional FSAC team will be deployed to provide coordination and response support.\n\nHealth: WHO Emergency Response mobile teams have successfully transported a consignment of essential medicines, medical kits, tents, and 300 solar lights to Ghor province. Additionally, WHO and cluster partners have initiated further transportation of medical supplies to Ghor from Kabul and are exploring delivery options with additional shipments from Kabul via Bamyan. Medical and surveillance teams are being deployed to provide urgent support and enhance disease detection in affected districts. WHO plans to deploy additional Surveillance Support Teams (SSTs) to enhance active disease surveillance in the affected districts. This will allow for early detection and timely response to potential outbreaks of communicable diseases, particularly waterborne illnesses.\n\nHealth Cluster partners deployed Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams (MHNTs) to provide emergency healthcare services to the affected communities. In Ghor province, eight MHNTs have been deployed to the districts of Ferozkoh, Dolayna, Murghab, Shahrak and Tolak. Additionally, the Health Cluster partners have deployed five MHNTs to Bilcheragh, Pashtun Kot, and Maimana districts of Faryab province.\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs www.unocha.org\n---\nOCHA Afghaistan | 3\n\nIn Faryab province, efforts are underway to repair and rehabilitate two health centers that have been destroyed. Both medical and non-medical equipment have been damaged and require urgent replacement. The current shortage of medicines underscores the necessity for increased supplies to meet the escalating demand. Additionally, there is a critical need to scale up the distribution of essential NFIs, including sanitary kits, emergency kits, Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) kits, pneumonia kits, hygiene kits, and tents.\n\nNutrition: In Bilcheragh district in Faryab province, two clinics providing essential nutrition services - Qurchi Basic Health Centre (BHC) and Mir Sahdi Sub-Health Centre (SHC) - are non-functional due to flood damage. To mitigate the impact, additional nutrition partners and resources have been deployed to the affected area.\n\nProtection: Protection partners are mobilizing resources for a joint assessment of emerging protection needs, with data used to address specific needs such as MHPSS, legal assistance, and other services for vulnerable groups. Protection partners have been requested to review the contingency stocks and report on available stocks to respond in flood-affected areas. Protection cluster partners are awaiting assessment outcomes to deploy essential relief assistance, including protection services.\n\nWASH: Cluster partners indicate an urgent need for drinking water, food, shelter in flood-affected districts in Ghor Province. Furthermore, several UNICEF-supported health facilities including Murghab Comprehensive Health Centre (CHC), Jandak SHC, Surpan SHC, Ghalmin BHC, and Asparf SHC are at significant risk of flooding.\n\nCash Assistance: The Cash and Voucher Working Group in Kabul is helping to coordinate the field level response through a tracker of partners\u2019 response plans and activities which has been developed into an online dashboard. So far, one CVWG partner has reached approximated 32 households in Faryab province with reduced MPCA using cash modalities to support affected households where market capacity is sufficient. The working group recommends the use of multi-purpose cash and encourages partners to adopt the new MEB and transfer value.\n\nCoordination\n\nOCHA continues to coordinate the emergency response on behalf of humanitarian partners through daily joint Operational Coordination Team (OCT) and Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) meetings, as well as the coordination of joint humanitarian needs assessments. The Western Region Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (R-ICCG) is organizing a road mission from Hirat to Ghor on 22 May.\n\nHumanitarian partners, including the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and the Department of Refugees and Repatriation (DoRR), are coordinating with de-facto authorities.\n\nTo date, 20 joint emergency assessment teams (JATs) have been deployed to the affected districts in Ghor province, where efforts are led by OCHA together with ACTED, ARRAA, BARAN, CHA, CORDAID, CRS, IOM, UNHCR, UNICEF, RRASWO, WASSA, WFPTPM/RRAA, WVA. In Faryab province, assessment teams have been deployed across affected districts led by IOM together with AADA, ACTED, HIA, IMC, NAC, NRC, ORCD, SAF, SCI, SUO, UNHCR, WVI. In Faryab province, JATs are utilizing the household-level multi-sector rapid assessment tool (MRAT) for initial assessments.\n\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs www.unocha.org",

To date, reports suggest that 180 people have been confirmed killed and 280 injured1. Among the most affected districts are Burka and Baghlani Jadid in Baghlan Province where 80 per cent of deaths\n\nhave been recorded. Rising water levels continue to be reported in a total of 6 districts of Baghlan province (Baghlani Jadid, Nahrin, Burka, Pul Khumri, Dahan e Ghori Doshi and Guzargah Noor, district). The weekend\u2019s rains have\n\ncaused the largest flooding event in Afghanistan so far this year. Prior to this flooding episode, 30,055 people (4,095 families) had been affected by floods across the country, mainly in the southern and western regions. Preliminary reports suggest that during the period 16-17 May, over 2,500 families were also affected by\n\nUNICEF Emergency Response Teams are on the ground supporting ongoing immediate interventions in the affected areas through water trucking, provision of essential supplies including hygiene kits, family kits, blankets, tarpaulin, and multi-purpose cash. Plans are underway to scale up ongoing health, WASH, education, nutrition, child protection, social behaviour change and emergency cash transfer interventions in the affected areas. UNICEF is also developing a costed response plan primarily focusing on the most flood affected\n\nprovinces in the northern and western regions.\n\nUNICEF Response\n\nHealth and Nutrition \u2022 To date, the UNICEF-supported health teams have treated a total of 11,4292 people (48 per cent children). The flooding has had a significant impact on women and children. UNICEF continues to provide health care services in the affected areas through mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNTs). Five tents have also been provided to augment the existing health facilities and to be used by the mobile health teams. The tents will be used primarily for providing women, adolescents, and children access to reproductive and child health services. Four health and nutrition sites are providing health services in Shaikhjalal, Folol, Saye Hazara and Gharoo villages of Baghlani Jadid , Burka and Guzargah Noor districts (Baghlan province). \u2022 UNICEF continues to provide supplies in the flood affected areas including acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) periphery kits, medicines, multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) tablets for pregnant women, deworming tablets for children under five years old, vitamin A tablets and measuring boards and scales were also delivered in the most flood affected areas. Prior to the onset of the emergency, UNICEF had prepositioned 37,615 bottles of MMS tables (100 tablets/bottle) and 12,649 packs of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) tablets (100 tablets/pack), in addition to 959 cartons of ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF) to the health facilities in the flood affected areas. The supplies are sufficient for 1,000 children affected by severe wasting.\n\nOCHA Flash Updates #2 Floods hit Northeastern Afghanistan, 16 May 2024. Total 3,657 women and 5,486 children out of 11, 429 people treated from UNICEF supported health facilities (Shaikhjalal BHC, Folol BHC , Saye Hazara SHC and Gharoo CHC ) Baghlan Jadid, Burka and Goozargahee Noor district of Baghlan province.\n---\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) \u2022 To date, UNICEF has reached 22,050 people with safe drinking water through water trucking in 3 flood affected districts/villages in Baghlan and Takhar provinces. An average of 330,750 litres of safe drinking water is distributed\n\nevery day, with each person receiving 15 litre per day as per Sphere standards. Since the beginning of the response 2,656 people have been reached with hygiene promotion messages and 1,500 households have received WASH critical supplies (hygiene kits, soap, bucket, and jerry cans) in Baghlan, and Badakhshan provinces.\n\nEducation and Child Protection UNICEF has despatched 20 high performance tents (HPTs) and 200 floormats for use in community-based education classes (CBEs) to its implementing partner Asia Community Development Organization (ACDO). UNICEF will provide an additional 78 HPTs, 161 floormats, 80 whiteboards and markers, 137 teacher kits and 227 students kits to 23 public schools affected by flooding in four districts of Baghlan province. UNICEF has provided support to three flood affected CBEs enabling children to resume their learning in the most flood affected districts. These classes are accommodating 85 children (45 girls and 40 boys) in Sheikh Jalal and Karkar villages in Baghlani Jadid and Puli Khumri districts in Baghlan province. To date, 900 people (70% children) have received mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and information on wellbeing and explosive ordinance risk education (EORE) through UNICEF supported Implementing Partners. In addition, 180 children (50% girls) are attending three established child friendly spaces (CFS) integrated with CBE classes, managed by UNICEF partners. 312 children's clothing kits, 2,000 MHPSS leaflets, one tent, seven recreational kits, 1,500 baby blankets, 500 TLMs are currently being distributed in the CFSs. A Child Protection Area of Responsibility rapid assessment was conducted during the reporting period, preliminary results show that 554 children (290 girls and 264 boys) are in need of child protection services. Plans are underway to train 500 Community Health Workers to provide MHPSS support to the affected populations.\n\nCash assistance UNICEF has activated the internal cash-based Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) which will ensure immediate lifesaving support to 3,000 households in three of the most affected districts (Baghlani Jadid, Burka, Guzargah Noor) with one-off multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) of US$ 312 to cover basic needs for a period of two months. The amount is in line with the Cash and Voucher Working Group (CVWG) recommendation for the transfer value during sudden onset emergencies. As of 18 of May, a total of 499 Households in Baghlani Jadid district in Baghlan province received cash assistance in a joint distribution exercise with UN agencies and NGOs.\n\nSocial and behaviour change, Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Social mobilizers disseminated lifesaving messages on water treatment, personal hygiene to prevent water borne diseases among flood affected communities in Baghlani Jadid, Burka, Puli Khumri, and Dahni Ghori districts reaching a total of 3,205 individuals. As part of accountability to affected people, through established community engagement feedback centres (CEFCs) and a field visit, social mobilizers recorded 277 feedbacks from the affected communities in Baghlani jaded and Dahni Ghori districts of Baghlan province. Plans are underway to finalize the analysis of the feedback.\n---\nHumanitarian Leadership, Coordination, and Strategy Through Nutrition Cluster partners support, 55 children with severe wasting, 192 children with moderate wasting and 138 pregnant and lactating women were admitted into the treatment programme in the flood affected areas in Baghlan province. In addition, 850 children under five years benefited from the blanket supplementary feeding programme (BSFP) in Baghlan province , 119 children in Badakhshan province, and 193 children in Takhar province.3 WASH cluster partners including UNICEF have provided safe drinking water to over 1,900 households in Burka district. 2,259 hygiene kits were distributed by WASH cluster partners in Baghlani Jadid and Burka districts. In addition, 15,813 individuals received hygiene promotion in Baghlani Jadid, Dahni Ghori, and Puli Khumri Districts (Baghlan province). Results from preliminary assessments conducted by Education cluster Partners show that 23 public schools and 21 CBE classes were destroyed by flooding in Baghlan province. Preliminary results from the CPAoR rapid assessment show that 554 children (290 girls and 264 boys) are in need of child protection services. Plans are underway to train 500 Community Health Workers to provide MHPSS support to the affected populations.\n\nUNICEF Planned Response \u2022 Scale up of health and nutrition services with focus on screening and treatment of children with wasting. \u2022 Scale up provision of sanitation services including family hygiene kits and the provision of latrine slabs. \u2022 Expanding capacity of child friendly spaces and community-based education. \u2022 Enhancing the capacity of SBC social mobilizer and community structures through orientation sessions and further dissemination of lifesaving messages through a variety of platforms. UNICEF is developing a response plan that will continue to emphasise immediate needs however will also consider early recovery efforts.\n\nGaps and Challenges \u2022 Road damages in some of the most flood affected districts are posing challenges for humanitarian partners to reach the most vulnerable populations. It is key to note that essential supplies cannot be transported through the road network in in Guzargahe Noor district (Baghlan province). There is a need for unearmarked flexible funds to scale up the ongoing interventions as well the first steps to transition to recovery interventions to meet the humanitarian and basic needs of the vulnerable populations affected by the current flooding episodes as well as other multiple shocks. An immediate scale up of critical and lifesaving WASH interventions is needed to reduce the risk of acute watery diarrhoea and cholera in the flood affected communities.\n\nWho to contact for further information:\n\nDr. Tajudeen Oyewale Representative UNICEF Afghanistan Tel: +93 79 995 7108 Email:toyewale@unicef.org\n\nMr. Abdulkadir Musse Chief of Field Service UNICEF Afghanistan Tel: +93 79 998 7131 Email: amusse@unicef.org\n\nMr. Daniel Timme Chief of Communication UNICEF Afghanistan Tel: +93 79 998 7110 Email:dtimme@unicef.org",

Figures are preliminary and may be subject to change.\n\nIbid.\n---\nUNHCR Afghanistan\n\nUNHCR\u2019s RESPONSE\n\nUNHCR and partners are actively participating in the inter-agency joint assessment teams currently on the ground to conduct surveys to identify the humanitarian impact of the recent floods across the Northern, Northeastern and Western regions of Afghanistan.\n\nIn the Northeast, in Baghlan Province, UNHCR has distributed 216 emergency tents, 304 non-food item (NFI) kits, and 204 sets of clothing to flood affected families in six districts, namely in Baghlan Jadid, Pulikhumri, Dushi, Deh Salah, Puli Hesar, and Tala wa Barfak districts. In Takhar Province, UNHCR has distributed 10 emergency tents, 40 NFI kits, and 40 sets of clothing to families affected by floods in Taluqan and Kalfgan districts. UNHCR has delivered emergency tents to flood-affected families that have lost their homes, providing immediate shelter for improved physical safety and protection outcomes of recipients. NFI kits and clothing assistance have been similarly delivered to ensure that families have access to essential and basic household items, linked to improved health, hygiene, and protection outcomes for families. NFI kits are composed of blankets, jerrycans, gas cylinder, kitchen sets, buckets, and other key items.\n\nTo address gaps in assessing protection concerns of affected populations, UNHCR is currently in the process of developing a rapid needs assessment with a specific focus on protection to understand and monitor the needs of populations impacted by the floods in all affected provinces. The assessment will allow UNHCR to gather comprehensive and up-to-date information to guide its response efforts effectively. Among the thematic areas covered by the assessment, special attention will be given to civil documentation and MHPSS, which continue to be identified as primary protection concerns expressed by affected populations.\n\nFurther, in the Western Region, UNHCR has initiated a comprehensive Protection response, involving the deployment of UNHCR and partner mobile teams through provision of integrated protection services and conducting protection assessments on-site. Concurrently, 13 mobile response teams are being mobilized in Ghor, Herat and Badghis provinces to address a spectrum of protection needs in the emergency, including provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, Psychological First Aid, identification and support with individual protection assistance to persons with specific needs (including family separation, unaccompanied and separated children, GBV), community feedback mechanism/outreach and facilitating referrals. More than 700 individuals have benefitted from the protection services so far. Protection monitoring findings with analysis of protection needs and hotspot areas are shared on regular basis with OCHA and respective clusters for timely follow-up. Through the Protection cluster UNHCR ensures coordination of protection activities and mainstreaming of protection principles in the responses.\n\nThe Protection Cluster, led by UNHCR, has gathered preliminary information on the protection concerns and needs faced by flood-affected populations. Key concerns include mental health and psychological distress, psychological first aid (PFA), and civil documentation. Critical activities identified as priority include, but are not limited to, cash for protection, psychosocial support, family tracing and reunification, case management, group and individual therapy sessions, training for caretakers and community leaders\n\non life skills, mental health and psychosocial support services, civil documentation, and establishment of complaint feedback mechanisms.\n\nProtection Cluster partners, including UNHCR, IMC, ACTED, ABWSO, NRC, IRC, WAW, AWSDC, AKAH, Mission Aid, Concern Worldwide, ORCD, IOM, OHW, HALLO and ARCS, are actively delivering protection response to affected populations, including psychological support services, positive parenting and resources on individual therapy for resilience, awareness and counselling sessions, community dialogue, and have established child friendly spaces. Mine Action partners have additionally been engaged under\n---\nUNHCR Afghanistan\n\nProtection response to deliver information on explosive ordinance contamination around flash flood impacted areas, to offer explosive ordnance risk education, and other urgent response.\n\nThe Shelter Cluster, co-led by UNHCR, continues to coordinate the emergency shelter response to flood affected areas. The humanitarian response following the natural disasters in Baghlan, Takhar, and Badakhshan provinces has been significant and is ongoing. As of 20 May 2024, more than 3,100 families have been assessed by humanitarian partners, with 2,209 families identified eligible for assistance, 1,143 homes reported as destroyed and 1,805 homes reported as damaged. Within in-accessible districts, partners estimate that an additional 250 families will need emergency shelter and NFI support.\n\nThe collaborative efforts of Shelter Cluster partners, including IOM, CWW, IMC, AKAH, ME, ACTED, WAW, and UNHCR, have been instrumental in providing emergency shelter and non-food item (NFI) assistance to affected families across the affected provinces. Shelter Cluster partners continue to volunteer staff to participate in joint assessment teams and respond to the needs of affected people. Across the three provinces, 1,934 families have received emergency shelter and NFI assistance including tents, tarpaulin, nonfood items, MPCA, clothing and others.\n\nIn Baghlan province alone, nearly all families eligible for assistance have received emergency shelter assistance. Out of the 1,436 families selected for assistance, 1,423 families have received emergency shelter and NFI assistance. In Takhar Province, out of the 449 families selected for assistance, 417 families have received emergency shelter and NFI assistance while in Badakhshan province, 94 families have received assistance. Assessments are underway in 5 districts of Badakhshan.\n\n\u00a9UNHCR/Wahid Ahmad Enayat\n---\nUNHCR Afghanistan\n\nOTHER SUPPORT NEEDS\n\nThe situation facing flood affected communities urgently demands response, with critical needs including shelter, non-food items, medical aid, hygiene kits, and other basic relief items. Response teams are working to provide immediate and life-saving assistance, with the objective to inter-link first line response with long- term resilience and recovery initiatives for a region repeatedly affected by natural disasters. While inter- agency assessments are underway across affected areas, preliminary findings raised by assessment teams \u00a9WAW/Fazal Wahab Aman indicate that key gaps requiring response include:\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\n\nImmediate need for live-saving emergency shelter and NFI assistance, including emergency shelter kits (e.g., tents and plastic tarpaulin), repair tools kits, and other core relief items (CRIs), to protect affected families from the elements and replace basic household items.\n\nShelter repair and rebuilding assistance for families whose homes have been destroyed or damaged, supporting their quick recovery and the restoration of built infrastructure, prior to the onset of the winter season. At this time, partners do not have sufficient funds to support recovery efforts beyond the initial emergency phase. Longer-term recovery efforts are crucial in supporting families to rebuild their lives and underpin self-reliance for resilient communities.\n\nEmergency stockpiles of tents and NFI kits must be replenished, ensuring Cluster capacities are adequate in-country to respond to sudden onset emergencies.\n\nStructural and non-structural disaster risk reduction approaches at the household and community level must be implemented to reduce the risk of floods. Key high impact interventions include construction of embankments, inclusion of flood-control elements in shelter design, establishment of early warning systems, and zoning regulations to prevent construction and/or settlements in flood-prone areas.\n\nSite election and settlement planning support to enable the relocation of communities residing in flood-prone areas, as part of broader disaster and risk management strategy.\n\n\u00a9AKAH-A/Hamidullah Habibyar",

        "content": "title: Northern and Western Region Flash Floods Update # 2 \n content: UNICEF Afghanistan\n\nNorthern and Western Region Flash Floods Update # 2\n\n26 May 2024\n\nSituation Overview On 10 and 11 May, heavy rainfall and flash floods struck northeastern Afghanistan, affecting 21 districts across Badakhshan (5), Baghlan (10), and Takhar (6) provinces. To date, reports suggest that 347 people are confirmed killed and 1,651 injured1. Approximately 7,800 homes were either destroyed or damaged, leaving over 5,000 families displaced according to the de facto Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation. In addition to damaged or destroyed roads, bridges, health facilities and public schools, agricultural land and livestock were also lost. Between 16 and 17 May 2024, Ghor province experienced heavy rains and flash floods that affected 10 districts2, with Murghab being the most affected. Reports suggest that 40 people were killed, including 10 children; 20 people are missing and 49 are injured. Preliminary reports indicate that over 410 families destroyed or partially Hygiene promotion sessions conducted for damaged, 27 health and nutrition facilities were destroyed or partially men and women include information on personal hygiene like handwashing with damaged, and 62 schools are severely damaged3. On 17 May, Faryab province was also affected by flash flooding impacting 9 districts4. Preliminary reports suggest that 62 people were killed and 18 people were injured. In addition, 1,890 houses were damaged or destroyed, and three health facilities and 23 schools were impacted.5 UNICEF Emergency Response Teams are on the ground supporting ongoing interventions in the affected areas. These interventions include water trucking and providing essential supplies including hygiene kits, family kits, blankets, tarpaulins, floor mats, teaching and learning materials, and High-Performance Tents to allow educational services to resume.\n\nUNICEF Response\n\nHealth and Nutrition\n\nThe floods had a significant impact on women and children. In the Northern Region, UNICEF-supported health teams have treated a total of 17,915 people, 48 per cent of whom are children. UNICEF continues to provide healthcare services in affected areas through mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNTs). Five tents were provided to augment existing health facilities and to be used by MHNTs. The tents will primarily be used to provide reproductive and child healthcare for women, adolescents, and children. Four health facilities which had suspended services due to flooding in Baghlan are now fully operational.\n\nUNICEF continues providing acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) periphery kits, medicines, multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) for pregnant women, deworming tablets for children under five years, vitamin A tablets, and measuring boards and scales to screen children for malnutrition in the flood affected areas.\n\nOCHA Flash Updates #2 Floods hit Northeastern Afghanistan, 16 May 2024.\n\nCharsada, Dawlatyar, Dolaina, Ferozkoh, Lal Wa Sarjangal, Murghab, Passband, Saghar, Shahrak, and Tolak districts\n\nSources of data include, Provincial Disaster Management Committee reports and inter-agency rapid assessment reports.\n\nPashtonKot, Khaiber, Dawlat Abad, Bilcheragh, Almar, Qaisar, Chehlgazi, Khuwaja Musa and Maymana district. 5 OCHA response tracking sheet. Faryab province.\n---\nA total of 73 children in flood-affected areas have been identified with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and admitted for treatment. In the Western Region, six MHNTs were deployed to 4 districts6 to provide emergency health services in the most affected areas, including Murghab district where an increase in AWD cases was reported. Through its partner, UNICEF provided 11 ambulances operating throughout Ghor province to transfer injured people to nearby hospitals.\n\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) In the Northern Region, UNICEF has provided a total of 22,050 people with safe drinking water through water trucking in three flood-affected districts in Baghlan and Takhar provinces. An average of 330,750 litres of safe drinking water is distributed every day, with each person receiving 15 litre per day as per Sphere standards. Since the beginning of the response 2,656 people have been reached with hygiene promotion messages and 1,500 households received critical WASH supplies (hygiene kits, soap, buckets and jerry cans) in Baghlan and Badakhshan provinces. UNICEF also distributed hygiene kits, which include WASH consumables to 69 households (around 483 Hygiene promotion sessions conducted for men and women include information on personal hygiene like handwashing with soap at individuals) in Chaghcharan/Feroz Koh district, and appropriate times, safe water storage, and maintaining a hygienic supported hygiene promotion for the affected communities. UNICEF has distributed a one-month supply of water purification tablets to the same households.\n\nEducation and Child Protection\n\nIn the Northern Region, UNICEF helped resume educational services for 150 students (80 girls and 70 boys) enrolled in community-based education (CBE) classes by installing five High-Performance Tents and floor mats in four districts7 where CBE classes had been destroyed by flooding.\n\nA recent rapid assessment for child protection needs indicates that 554 children (290 girls and 264 boys) affected by the floods still need child protection services in the Northern Region.\n\nA total of 2,100 people (60 per cent children) received mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and information on wellbeing and explosive ordinance risk education (EORE). In addition, 180 children (50 per cent girls) are attending three child-friendly spaces (CFS) integrated with CBE classes. UNICEF distributed 312 children's clothing kits, 2,000 MHPSS informational leaflets, one tent, seven recreational kits and 1,500 baby blankets. UNICEF is distributed 500 teaching and learning materials through CFS.\n\nIn the Western Region, UNICEF established two child-friendly spaces in Madrasa and Badgah villages in Chaghcharan/Feroz Koh district, Ghor province.\n\nCash assistance\n\nIn the Northern Region, UNICEF activated its internal cash-based Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), providing immediate and life-saving cash assistance to 1,136 households in Baghlan-e-Jadid district, the most affected district in the region. Each household received one-off multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) equal to US$ 312 to cover basic needs for a period of two months. This amount is in line with the Cash and Voucher Working Group (CVWG) recommendation for the transfer value during sudden onset emergencies.\n\nAn RRM was activated in the Western Region. The response was delayed due to access challenges, however on 25 May, UNICEF provided life-saving cash assistance to 110 households in two villages of Ferozkoh district.\n\nFerozkoh, Tulak, Shahrak and Murghab.\n\nPul-i-Khumri, Baghlan-e-Jadid, Dahn Ghori, and Burka districts of Baghlan province.\n---\nSocial and behaviour change, Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP)\n\nIn the Northern Region, social mobilizers shared life-saving messages on water treatment and personal hygiene to prevent waterborne diseases in seven districts8 in Baghlan and Takhar provinces, reaching 12,262 people (8,128 in Baghlan and 4,528 in Takhar).\n\nccountability to Affected Populations (AAP), through established Community Engagement and Feedback Centres, social mobilizers recorded 623 instances of feedback (364 in Baghlan and 259 in Takhar). This feedback will be referred to relevant UNICEF programme staff and addressed as needed.\n\nUNICEF-supported social mobilizers provided MHPSS services and disseminated messages on protection, psychosocial well-being, and prevention and treatment of mental health conditions for 1,106 people in Baghlan province.\n\nAround 40,000 information, education and communication materials in Pashto and Dari were dispatched to Baghlan and Takhar provinces.\n\nIn the Western Region, social mobilizers support delivery of key positive behaviour change messages on water treatment, personal hygiene, and prevention of waterborne diseases, reaching a total of 1,580 individuals in Ghor province. As part of accountability to affected people, social mobilizers recorded 150 feedbacks from flood affected communities in Ghor province. Plans are underway to finalize the analysis of the feedback.\n\nHumanitarian Leadership, Coordination, and Strategy (Clusters)\n\nIn the Northern Region, Nutrition Cluster partners supported 73 children for treatment of severe wasting and 305 children with moderate wasting. A total of 191 pregnant and lactating women were admitted for treatment of malnutrition in flood-affected areas in Baghlan province. In addition, 850 children under five benefited from the blanket supplementary feeding programme (BSFP) in Baghlan province, 119 children in Badakhshan province, and 193 children in Takhar province.\n\nThree WASH cluster partners, including UNICEF, provided safe drinking water to over 1,900 households in Burka district, Baghlan province. A total of 2,259 hygiene kits were distributed in Baghlan-e-Jadid and Burka districts. In addition, 15,813 individuals participated in hygiene promotion sessions across three distrcits in Baghlan province. In the Western Region, sub-national education cluster partners reported that 110 CBE classes were damaged or destroyed (22 destroyed, 89 partially damaged). Of the affected CBEs, education cluster partners reported that 31 classes have resumed since the beginning of the floods. The Provincial Education Department (PED) reported that 76 public schools throughout Ghor were damaged and require rehabilitation.\n\nThe sub-national nutrition cluster in the Western Region deployed 12 MHNTs to Chaghcharan/Feroz Koh, Murghab, Tulak, Dolaina and Shahrak districts in Ghor province to screen, identify, treat or refer children affected by wasting.\n\nUNICEF Planned Response In the Northern Region: Preposition AWD kits in Baghlan and Faryab provinces. Provide teaching and learning materials and support rehabilitation of 23 public schools. Conduct an orientation session for social mobilizers and community structures for further dissemination of lifesaving messages.\n\nIn the Western Region: Establish child-friendly spaces and resume CBE classes. Conduct assessment of damaged WASH infrastructure, including water supply systems and sanitation facilities, to determine necessary support for rehabilitation.\n\n8Baghlan Province-Baghlani Jadid, Burka, Puli Khumri, Dahni Ghori districts. Takhar province-Chal , Eshkamish and Namakab districts.\n---\nExpand the coverage of water trucking interventions to ensure that each person receives a minimum of 15 litres/person per day for drinking and hygiene purposes, in-line with the sphere standards.\n\nGaps and Challenges\n\nIn both the Northern and Western Region, an immediate scale up of critical and lifesaving WASH interventions is needed to reduce the risk of AWD and cholera in flood-affected communities as prior to the flooding, the affected provinces were endemic to AWD/Cholera.\n\nIn the Western Region, there is limited accessibility to the most flood-affected districts, which impacts joint assessments and provision of essential supplies.\n\nHumanitarian partners have reported challenges in securing exemptions for female aid workers to participate in and conduct joint assessments in Ghor. There is a need for concerted advocacy efforts to ensure that female health aid workers across all the sectors support ongoing response interventions and reach the most vulnerable women and children.\n\nWho to contact for further information:\n\nDr. Tajudeen Oyewale Representative UNICEF Afghanistan Tel: +93 79 995 7108 Email: toyewale@unicef.org\n\nMr. Abdulkadir Musse Chief of Field Service UNICEF Afghanistan Tel: +93 79 998 7131 Email: amusse@unicef.org\n\nMr. Daniel Timme Chief of Communication UNICEF Afghanistan Tel: +93 79 998 7110 Email:dtimme@unicef.org",

        "title": "Guideline on Food Security and Agriculture Cluster Response Packages",
        "content": "title: Guideline on Food Security and Agriculture Cluster Response Packages \n content: Guideline on Food Security and Agriculture Cluster Response Packages\n\nThe Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) has been a central part of the humanitarian response in Afghanistan. The FSAC is co-led by the World Food Program (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with a non-governmental organization (NGO, currently WHH) as Co-chair.\n\nFSAC response strategy 2024 includes food assistance through cash and in-kind modalities, agriculture kit, vegetable kit, livestock kit, ruminants and poultry, and livestock vaccination. It is important to use a uniform approach as per minimum acceptable humanitarian standards across the country where relevant to avoid inequality, harm, and improper utilization of already stretched resources. In case of significant change in the context like vulnerability or market price changes, the packages need to be better explained to justify humanitarian intervention. These guidelines are thoroughly discussed with FSAC partners, donors, and humanitarian agencies in various FSAC meetings and approved and agreed by all relevant stakeholders.\n\nDue to ongoing exchange rate disparities for agriculture and livelihood packages please consult FSAC before adopting the below recommended packages.\n\nFood Assistance: Food assistance is one of the largest interventions in the humanitarian response strategy. FSAC partners agreed to have separate food baskets for cash and in-kind response because of multiple challenges. FSAC\u2019s cash basket is different from in-kind basket. Rice is not included in the in-kind basket, mainly due to its cost. Considering however beneficiaries\u2019 preference and consumption habits and feedback from partners, FSAC included domestic rice1 in its cash basket.\n\nBasic rules that have been considered to design food assistance package are: Minimum 2100 kcal/person/day for emergencies (with rations being designed to attempt to ensure that the \u201cfood gap\u201d is met, after considering populations capacity to meet own food needs), but it varies with climatic conditions, type of work/livelihoods and vulnerable groups. Family size Nutritional balance Cultural food habits and practices Specific needs come from evidence-based assessment (nutritional deficiency etc.) Overall needs vs funding availability Logistic constraints Equality, equity and do no harm\n\nProduced locally (not imported), having the same nutritional value as the imported rice. FSAC response packages -May 2024 update\n---\nFSAC recommended guideline is 75% of the full basket for IPC 4 population and 50% for the IPC 3 population.\n\nDue to funding limitations and to enable FSAC to address the needs of as many people in need, FSAC is recommending distribution of 50% of the full food basket (both in-kind and cash) for IPC Phase 3 and IPC 4 populations.\n\nIn-kind food basket: In-kind response food basket, at the 100% ration level, must include 100 kg wheat flour, 8 kg pulses, 8 liters oil, and 1 kg salt to provide 2100 kcal/person/day. This package\n\nprovides enough amount of protein, micronutrients, and fat for a household of 7 members for a month. WFP uses a slightly different food basket, at the 100% ration level, which includes 100 kg\n\nwheat flour, 9.1 kg vegetable oil, 12.5 kg pulses, 1 kg salt. In some situations, a ration of 2.1 Kg of High Energy Biscuits is also provided.\n\nAfter several consultations with partners and the CVWG, FSAC has adopted to set the transfer value of the food basket in local currency. This has been necessitated because most of the partners budget and distribute cash in local currency. For partners who budget in US$, the prevalent exchange rate should be applied. Partners can refer to the monthly UN exchange rate from Afghanistan, available online from this link: UN Operational Rates of Exchange All partners should specify which exchange rate they have adopted in their proposals. NB: Due to the unpredictable fluctuation of the AFN ex-rate, partners can apply a budget buffer of at least 5-10% to their USD budget. Approval of the budget is subject to the donor consideration.\n\nFSAC response packages -May 2024 update\n---\nCash-based food basket: To give beneficiaries a wider choice of food commodities the cash-based food basket must include wheat flour, domestic rice, vegetable oil, pulses, and salt.\n\n|    | 0             | 1           | 2         | 3                    |\n|----|---------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|\n|  0 | Items         | Unit        | Quantity  | Average Price in AFN |\n|  1 | Wheat Flour   | kg          | 89        | 2759                 |\n|  2 | Domestic Rice | kg          | 21        | 963                  |\n|  3 | Vegetable Oil | liter       | 7         | 1302                 |\n|  4 | Pulses        | kg          | 9         | 658                  |\n|  5 | Salt          | kg          | 1         | 17                   |\n|  6 |               | Total (AFN) | *5800 AFN |                      |\n\nMonitoring of food basket value and adaptation of transfer value: FSAC has set triggers/thresholds to enable review of the transfer value in a timely manner in line with inflation and exchange rate fluctuations. While budget and planning are done in USD, due to the exchange rate disparities and to\n\nensure coherence programme design (as price monitoring, distribution, and beneficiary spending is all conducted in AFN) the triggering mechanism will be in AFN. The food MEB value will be set in AFN value and applying the prevalent exchange rates. The transfer value will potentially be changed when there is:\n\n1.\n\nTrigger 1: A change in food basket cost in AFN =>10% and <20% sustained for a period of eight consecutive weeks warrants a food basket cost revision. A tolerance of 1 percentage point or a price change of between 9% would also trigger a revision.\n\n2.\n\nTrigger 2: A change in food basket cost in AFN =>20% sustained for a period of four consecutive weeks warrants a food basket revision. A tolerance of 2 percentage points or a price change of between 18% would also trigger a revision.\n\nCash for work: Cash for work is commonly used in Afghanistan to cover food and income gap for the basic food basket and to rehabilitate basic livelihoods infrastructure. Cluster had a discussion in regional meetings, consultation with national FSAC partners to come up with recommended rates. These are 350 AFs to 400 Afs for unskilled and 700 AFs for skilled labor adjusted as per local rates to avoid large pool of labour from formal labour market. To know how many days a person should work to achieve 100% food basket through cash for work, food basket cost ($75) should be divided by daily wage labour. The basket cost and each food item amount should be adjusted if a partner wants to support families with half food basket. Half food basket distribution should be justified and supported by assessments and first-hand data.\n\nFSAC response packages -May 2024 update\n---\nAgriculture Kit: Agriculture package was discussed in detail with both MAIL (Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock) and FSAC partners and everyone agreed on the below package:\n\n|    | 0                     | 1                  | 2                    | 3                  | 4                   |\n|----|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n|  0 | Crop package (per HH) | Units              | Price per 1 MT (USD) | Price per kg (USD) | Cost per unit (USD) |\n|  1 | Certified wheat seed  | 50 kg              | 570                  | 0.57               | 29                  |\n|  2 | DAP fertilizer        | 50 kg              | 770                  | 0.77               | 39                  |\n|  3 | Urea fertilizer       | 50 kg              | 360                  | 0.36               | 18                  |\n|  4 | Transportation cost   | 150 kg             |                      | 4                  |                     |\n|  5 |                       | Total Package Cost | 90 USD               |                    |                     |\n\nPrices for certified wheat seeds, DAP and urea fertilizers include transportation cost up to the district centers in all provinces. Most of the distributions are taking place at district level so an additional 300 Afs (4 USD) are included for beneficiaries to transport inputs to their homes as per community demand. Basic guidelines must be provided to farmers to make good use of the inputs for better production.\n\nFor the areas where farmers are cultivating maize or for summer crops, cluster and MAIL recommend providing 12.5 kg maize seed, 50 kg Urea and 50 kg DAP. The variety of seeds and types of fertilizers may change in some areas, so cluster recommends partners to have discussion with regional focal points and MAIL directorates before planning input distribution. In cash 90 USD should be provided if certified seeds and quality fertilizers are available in local markets. Vegetable Kit: FSAC packages are designed to tackle with nutrition problem in the country as Afghanistan shows one of the worst nutrition indicators across the globe. Cluster is aiming to provide nutritious vegetable seeds and tools to grow nutritious vegetables at the household level for own consumption.

Package includes the below interventions, but it can be adjusted based on needs and justification. Like in 2018 drought because of the harvest loss wheat straw was not available in local markets. Wheat straw can be adjusted with additional animal feed.\n\nFSAC response packages -May 2024 update\n---\n|    | 0                                                | 1                   | 2               | 3                |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n|  0 | Livestock package (per HH)                       | Units               | Unit Cost (USD) | Total Cost (USD) |\n|  1 | Animal feed                                      | 100 kg              | 0.35            | 35               |\n|  2 | Straw (where possible and logistically feasible) | 200 kg              | 0.2             | 40               |\n|  3 | De-wormer                                        | 2 liters            | 8               | 16               |\n|  4 |                                                  | Transportation cost | 4               |                  |\n|  5 |                                                  | Total Package Cost  | 95 USD          |                  |\n\nEmergency livestock treatment and vaccination campaign will be conducted in close coordination with MAIL in case of major disease outbreak where government have no or limited capacity to response. This package is proposed for only vulnerable households on average 2 large ruminants and 8 small ruminants.\n\nPoultry package: Poultry plays an important role in improving daily food consumption and income for poor rural communities. FSAC designed the below package in consultation with NGO partners and government to improve food security and nutrition status, especially for women and children. The same package can be provided in cash where markets are functional and poultry packages are available in the local market.\n\n|    | 0                                 | 1                | 2               | 3                |\n|----|-----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n|  0 | Poultry package (per HH)          | Units            | Unit Cost (USD) | Total Cost (USD) |\n|  1 | Chicken (3 roaster & 27 hens)     | 30               | 6               | 180              |\n|  2 | Feed                              | 150 kg           | 0.55            | 82.5             |\n|  3 | Drinker                           | 3                | 2               | 6                |\n|  4 | Feeder                            | 3                | 2               | 6                |\n|  5 | Chicken coop support for material | 1 coop           | 120             | 120              |\n|  6 |                                   | Total Cost (USD) | 395 USD *2      |                  |\n\nAll agriculture-based food security and livelihoods intervention outlined in the FSAC strategy is integrated with food assistance and nutrition programme and the purpose of the intervention is to minimize direct food support and ensure food security and nutrition in remote targeted locations on long term basis.\n\nSmall ruminant package: Small ruminant packages offer an important way to diversify household income for poor families and improve food consumption. As multiple sectors have delivered small ruminant packages in the past, it is important to standardize this intervention and to ensure that inputs are delivered in a way to ensure sustainability.\n\nDue to funding limitations and to reach many beneficiaries FSAC can recommend 50% of the package.

There have been over 589,700 returnees recorded up to 18 May 2024, with numbers increasing from less than 200 per day in early October to more than 25,000 by early November.\n\nIn March 2024, the Pakistan federal interior ministry has issued orders to resume the repatriation process, targetting primarily Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders, starting from April 15, 2024. The number of returnees arriving from Pakistan has witnessed a slight increase since April 16 compared to previous weeks. However, the current levels of new arrivals do not indicate that the reported second wave has already started. The Border Consortium will continue to monitor the situation in coordination with IOM and UNHCR Pakistan, and will promptly relay confirmed updates while actively working with partners on preparedness plans.\n---\nPAKISTAN BORDER OPERATIONS (05 - 18 MAY)\n\nBORDER CONSORTIUM\n\nRETURNEE ASSISTANCE CUMULATIVE TOTAL\n\nTOTAL FOR REPORTING PERIOD\n\nPREPAREDNESS In light of the recent developments from Pakistan (see first page), the Border Consortium reviewed its contintengy plan for the Pakistan border and worked with the regional Consortium coordination groups to assess partners\u2019 capacity to maintain or scale up their operations as required. The Consortium also updated its 2023/2024 Border appeal and actively engages Power BI Desktop with partners and donors to anticipate gaps and ensure adequate resources are available in case of a renewed influx. The appeal was released as part of an Integrated Appeal for Afghans returning from Pakistan, in collaboration with the Durable Solutions Working Group.\n\nDAILY TRENDS - 24 MAR - 18 MAY 2024\n\nConsortium Partners have progressively scaled up and adjusted operations at both Spin Boldak and Torkham Border Points to respond to the significant increased on returns since mid-September 2023, in coordination with the DFA. Currently, the capacity of partners maintained at these locations allow for assistance provision the day of arrival. In addition to the Consortium partners\u2019 response, the DFA provides each family with cash assistance (10,000 Afghani) and a sim card.\n\n|    | 0                             | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       | 6       | 7       | 8       | 9       | 10      | 11      | 12      | 13      | 14      | 15       | 16                    | 17     |\n|----|-------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|-----------------------|--------|\n|  0 |                               | 05- May | 06- May | 07- May | 08- May | 09- May | 10- May | 11- May | 12- May | 13- May | 14- May | 15- May | 16- May | 17- May | 18- May | 5-18 May | 15 Sep 23 - 18 May 24 |        |\n|  1 | Undoc.

In the western Ghor Province, 10 districts have been affected so far and the Murghab district continue to face high risk due to debris obstructing the Murghab River, potentially leading to further flooding.\n\nAccessibility remains a challenge, with the road from Hirat to Ghor blocked, necessitating the mobilization of additional resources from Kabul.\n\nInitial reports indicate significant impact, with at least 120 people killed and hundreds more missed. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, with concerns about people trapped under collapsed structures. In the northern region, initial reports suggest around 560 households were affected by the first wave of flooding, followed by an\n---\nadditional 1,300 households impacted by a second wave on 18 May. Villages in Bilcheragh and Khaiber districts are currently unreachable due to difficult terrain and blocked roads.\n\nThe destruction of agricultural lands compounded the situation, as agriculture supports over 80% of Afghanistan\u2019s population. The vulnerability to climate change is clear, with drought-affected land unable to absorb heavy rains. Children and people with disabilities are among the most vulnerable to these climate-related impacts.\n\nUrgent resources are needed for humanitarian support and to restore essential infrastructure such as houses, schools, and health facilities.\n\nWHO, however, remains actively involved in assessing and responding to the health needs of affected populations, prioritizing the most vulnerable groups.\n\nEpidemiological update:\n\nIn Baghlan province, five Surveillance Support Teams (SSTs) are deployed, with two originally located in Baghlan and three mobilized from neighboring provinces. During this period, the following infectious diseases have been detected: \u00bb 715 cases of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Pneumonia \u00bb 587 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with dehydration \u00bb 71 suspected cases of measles \u00bb 92 suspected cases of COVID-19\n\n75 Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) were conducted for suspected COVID-19 cases, with 10 testing positive (positivity rate: 13.3%). Thirteen Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) samples were also collected and sent to the laboratory, with results pending. Three RDTs were conducted for AWD with dehydration cases, all of which tested negative. Samples were sent to the laboratory for 22 suspected measles cases, and the results are pending.\n\nTable 1: Number of reported cases of infectious diseases in flood-affected districts of Baghlan province\n\nDuring week 20-2024 (12-18 May 2024), the indicator- based surveillance system detected and reported a total of 752 cases of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Pneumonia, 158 cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) with dehydration, and 63 suspected cases of measles in five districts (Pul-e-Khumri, Baghlan-e-Jadid, Borka, Guzareh-e-Noor, and Nahreen) of Baghlan province.\n\nCumulatively from January 2024 to 18 May 2024, the indicator-based surveillance system in the districts of Baghlan detected and reported a total of 17,600 cases of ARI Pneumonia, 750 cases of AWD with dehydration, 518 suspected cases of measles, and no suspected cases of COVID-19.\n---\nFigure 1: The epidemiological curve of AWD with dehydration cases in the five districts heavily affected by floods, Baghlan, Afghanistan \u2013 01 Jan \u2013 18 May 2024\n\nFigure 3: The epidemiological curve of ARI Pneumonia cases in the five districts heavily affected by floods, Baghlan, Afghanistan \u2013 01 Jan \u2013 18 May 2024\n\nFigure 2: The epidemiological curve of suspected measles cases in the five districts heavily affected by floods, Baghlan, Afghanistan \u2013 01 Jan \u2013 18 May 2024\n\nFigure 4: AWD with dehydration cases in the five districts heavily affected by floods, Baghlan, Afghanistan \u2013 01 Jan \u2013 18 May 2024\n\nFigure 5: Suspected measles cases in the five districts heavily affected by Figure 6: ARI Pneumonia cases in the five districts heavily affected by floods, Baghlan, Afghanistan \u2013 01 Jan \u2013 18 May 2024 floods, Baghlan, Afghanistan \u2013 01 Jan \u2013 18 May 2024 The ARCS Bamyan MHT providing OPD and MNCH services to a vulnerable individual in Falol village, Burka district. \u00a9 ARCS\n---\nWHO continues its lifesaving response to the flood emergency in northern, western, and northeastern Afghanistan by deploying emergency response teams and distributing essential medical supplies, including trauma kits and medications, to affected areas. Efforts are also underway to enhance disease surveillance and coordinate access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. These initiatives aim to mitigate the health impacts of the floods and maintain the provision of essential healthcare services to the affected communities.\n\nAs of 20 May 2024, WHO Afghanistan\u2019s emergency team has provided urgent services, including: \u2022 Activating the Incident Management Team to support the response to the new floods hitting multiple provinces/regions, with a meeting held on 19 May to assess the current situation in the affected provinces. \u2022 Successfully transporting 30 metric tonnes of essential medicines, medical kits, tents, and solar lights to Ghor province. \u2022 Arranging for additional shipments of essential drugs and medical supplies from the Kabul Warehouse to Ghor province in the western region via Bamyan.\n\nDeploying two WHE Assessment Teams to assist in the lifesaving response efforts in the newly flooded areas, with another team providing additional medical and technical support in Ghor. scheduled the deployment of additional surveillance support teams (SSTs) to enhance active surveillance in the affected districts, particularly for waterborne diseases. Ensuring close coordination with Health Cluster partners and OCT members in Ghor province. Ensuring a provision of medicines, medical supplies, and consumables to health facilities serving the affected population for the next three months. Maintaining regular meetings with Health Cluster partners to coordinate response efforts, engage with partners, and monitor casualties, with strict adherence to safety measures. Considering deploying Mobile Health and Nutrition Teams (MHNTs) to ensure continuity of healthcare services in areas where facilities are damaged. Continuing efforts to address the evolving situation and provide necessary support to the affected population.\n\nWHO distributes essential medical supplies, including trauma kits and medications, to flood-affected community in Ghor Province. \u00a9 WHO\n---\nHealth Cluster response:\n\nCoordination: \u2022 Health Cluster partners, including AADA, ARCS, ACF, BARAN, ORCD, MOVE, RHDO, IOM, IRC, SAF, World Vision, UNFPA, UNICEF, and WHO, supported the health response to flood- affected communities in Ghor and Badghis provinces.

These teams delivered emergency healthcare services to the affected communities. Between 10-18 May 2024, Health Cluster partners provided health services to a total of 13,951 flood- affected individuals across the three provinces of Baghlan, Takhar and Badakhshan. The beneficiaries included 5,517 women, 3,005 men, 3,477 girls, and 1,952 boys. Out of the total beneficiaries, 7,825 individuals received primary health care consultations, 3,724 were reached with health promotion activities, 1,542 received Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) services, 768 received maternal, newborn, and child health services, and 92 received trauma care services.\n\nFigure 7: Beneficiaries of the Health Cluster healthcare service delivery\n---\nNeeds:\n\nAccess to safe drinking water remains a critical need within the community, as emphasized by WHO Afghanistan\u2019s technical team and Health Cluster coordination partners during ICCG/OCT meetings. Immediate action is required to address this issue. There is a severe shortage of mental health services and medication in addition to a lack of trained doctors, midwives, and nursing staff. Additional support is required for MHNTs in terms of medical supplies and capacity to deliver quality services. WHO\u2019s field team is gathering information to determine the type and scale of additional required support. Including at least one female health worker or female psychosocial counselor in each response team is essential, as the affected population is predominantly women and children. Significant challenges in accessibility due to the destruction of the main roads and bridges, necessitating alternative transportation methods to reach isolated\n\nmonitoring in affected areas, including joint assessments with WASH, to check for waterborne and infectious diseases. Safety measures such as chlorine are in place. WHO can provide support, including training on testing and treating water quality, if needed by WASH cluster partners. Health Cluster partners are supporting assessments in various locations. The reports will be shared upon completion of the assessments. Additionally, a sector- based assessment is planned for the affected areas of Ghor province. A joint needs assessment is also underway in the affected areas of Badghis province, with the participation of Health Cluster partners. The assessment report will be shared upon finalization.\n\nAmong these, four health facilities (1 BHC and 3 HSCs) are fully destroyed, while the remaining 26 are partially damaged. The breakdown of damaged health facilities by district is as follows: \u2022 Morghab: 1 CHC and 6 HSCs \u2022 FirozKoh: 1 CHC, 3 BHCs, and 1 HSC \u2022 Shahrak: 2 BHCs, 1 HSC, and 1 FHH \u2022 Lal o Sarjangal: 2 BHCs and 2 HSCs \u2022 Tay Wara: 4 HSCs \u2022 Dolyna: 1 HSC \u2022 Tolk: 1 BHC and 1 FHH \u2022 Dawlatyar: 2 HSCs and 1 FHH\n\nAfter the recent flooding, reports indicate that a total of four health facilities (1 CHC, 1 HSC, and 2 FHHs) are damaged in four affected districts of Badghis province. Among these, 1 FHH is fully destroyed in Qadis district, while the other three\n\n\u2022 Jawand: 1 CHC \u2022 Abkamary: 1 HSC \u2022 Bala Morghab: 1 FHH \u2022 Qadis: 1 FHH\n\nOn May 11, the following health facilities were reported as partially or totally damaged in the affected areas of the northeast region: \u2022 Gharo CHC in Guzargai Noor district of Baghlan. \u2022 A health facility in Chal district of Takhar. \u2022 Baghlan: Sheil Jalal BHC in Baghlan Markazi, and Folool BHC in Burka districts. \u2022 Takhar: Mandara BHC in Chal, Lataband BHC and Shurab HSC in Taloqan, and Mashtan BHC in Farkhar districts. \u2022 Badakhshan: Dai Ostayan HSC in Teshkan, and Bazar-e- Etefaq HSC in Yaftal Payeen districts.\n---\nChallenges:\n\nAs of 20 May 2024, challenges reported include: \u2022 Scarcity of safe drinking water, leading to the spread of waterborne diseases. Consequently, there is a critical shortage of safe drinking water in health facilities across the affected areas of both Ghor and Badghis provinces, further straining the already overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure. \u2022 WHO and Health Cluster partners have difficulties reaching affected populations due to severe damage to transportation infrastructure, including roads and bridges. As a result, communities are isolated, and movement between villages is hindered by flowing rivers. In addition, the blockade of the Herat to Ghor road is hindering the delivery of emergency supplies from Herat, exacerbating the challenges faced by relief efforts.\n\nPoverty and a lack of community awareness regarding communicable diseases are significant obstacles to effective response and recovery efforts. Inadequate financial resources are hindering the deployment of additional mobile teams and ambulances in flood-impacted regions. Enhancing collaboration among partners is crucial to ensure a more coordinated and effective response to the crisis. This includes improving information sharing, coordinating activities, and leveraging each partner\u2019s strengths to maximize the impact of the response efforts. Strengthening collaboration can lead to better resource allocation, reduced duplication of efforts, and ultimately, more efficient assistance to those affected by the flood crisis.\n\nORCD health services provided in Takhar,farkhar district. \u00a9 UNFPA\n\nFor more information about WHO\u2019s work in flooding, contact:\n\nDr Jamshed Tanoli, Health Emergencies Team Lead, WHO Afghanistan, Email: tanolij@who.int Ms Ajyal Manssour Al-Sultany, OIC, Communications, WHO Afghanistan, Email: sultanya@who.int Mr Mohamed Kakay, External Relations & Partnerships Lead, WHO Afghanistan, Email: kakaym@who.int Dr Shah Mansoor Staniczai, OIC, Health Cluster, WHO Afghanistan, Email: staniczais@who.int\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---",
