Quantities of cement have also been allocated to the communities.\nOver 100 families in the communities of Harbour View in St Andrew, Trench Town in Kingston, Woodside in Clarendon, and 11 Miles in Bull Bay, St Thomas have reportedly benefited so far.\nCommenting on the donations following the handover of the materials and food items at the Denbigh Church of the Nazarene in Woodside, Clarendon on Monday, July 9, CCCL Managing Director, Jorge Martinez expressed satisfaction at the work done by the team to ensure the needs of the communities are met.\n\u201cThis is a significant step in our efforts to support the communities in need, especially with the response time that we did. The dedication displayed by our team is truly commendable, ensuring that vital resources reach those who need them most. We remain committed to making a meaningful impact in the lives of others,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, Social Impact Specialist, Jerome Cowans expressed pride in being a part of an organisation that displays compassion for its communities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to witness firsthand the positive change that Carib Cement is making in the people\u2019s lives, and I look forward to continuing our social impact mission,\u201d he said.\nIn response to the company\u2019s efforts, pastor of the Denbigh Church of the Nazarene, Carlton Bryan, noted that the church as well as the community were grateful for CCCL\u2019s support. The church was essential in reaching those persons adversely affected by Hurricane Beryl.\n\u201cWe know that persons from this community have been affected, as in other parishes, but the response by Carib Cement to give back to this community makes us eternally grateful,\u201d he said.\nFor his part, community facilitator and resident of 11 Miles Bull Bay, Lamar Clarke also expressed gratitude to CCCL for the support to the community.\n\u201cWe are thankful because a few persons got displaced from their homes and generally they will have to rebuild before they can re-enter their homes so the support is welcomed so that persons can return to normalcy,\u201d he noted.",

We have been treating with this by virtue of; one, ensuring that we mainstream climate resilience in everything that we do. So, we are mainstreaming climate resilience in our budgeting process by building buffers and reserves and by literally budgeting for storms,\u201d said Prime Minister Holness.\nPrime Minister Holness highlighted critical importance of financial prudence of these measures, explaining that the aim is to prevent Jamaica from falling into a cycle of increased borrowing after every climatic event. \u201cWhat happened before is that every climate event pushed us into more borrowing. So, a part of our debt trap was as a result of having to borrow to recover from climate events, so we\u2019re trying to avoid going down that trajectory.\u201d\nOver the past eight years, Jamaica has experienced a series of natural weather events, including hurricanes, tropical storms, heavy flood rains and earthquakes, all of which have had significant fiscal implications. Prime Minister Holness stressed that these events cannot be viewed in isolation but rather as part of a broader pattern affecting infrastructure and economic stability.\nThe Prime Minister noted that while global and local philanthropy can provide short-term relief during crises like Hurricane Beryl, a sustainable recovery requires a robust economic and financial strategy.\nIn this regard, the government has developed a long-term plan to ensure that Jamaica can recover not only quickly but sustainably from these challenges.\nAcknowledging the diverse dimensions of crisis management, Prime Minister Holness emphasized the importance of coordinated efforts across public, corporate, civil society, and the philanthropic sectors as the country focuses on recovering stronger.",

It suffered extensive damage to residential and commercial buildings, as well as critical Jamaica Public Service (JPS) infrastructure, a release on Saturday said.\nSophia Lewis, head of the JPS Foundation, detailed the scope of the joint effort.\n\u201cOur immediate response sees the provision of care packages and access to charging stations to assist residents in their day-to-day lives until the full assessment of the specific needs of the communities are ascertained,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cThe support is multipronged and will be ongoing as we help the breadbasket parish bounce back from what can only be described as devastating circumstances,\u201d she added.\nJPS Foundation and FFTP Jamaica said that while care packages will cover the basics to include non-perishable food items, distribution of water and ice across the parish, sanitary items and tarpaulins, they are contemplating solutions for displaced residents whose properties would have been severely damaged by the strong winds and rains associated with the Category 4 storm.\nKivette Silvera Stephens, executive director at FFTP Jamaica, made the disclosure as the teams distributed aid in Parottee, Flagaman and Bull Savannah in St Elizabeth on Wednesday.\n\u201cIt is never a simple fix when one has been uprooted from the place they call home. More than the physical loss, it is an emotional roller coaster watching years of memories go down the drain or in some cases, go with the wind,\u201d she stated.\n\u201cIt will take a lot more hands on deck to help the people of St Elizabeth get back on their feet. It is for this reason that we extend sincere thanks to the JPS Foundation for helping to restore hope as their dedicated teams continue working to restore electricity islandwide,\u201d Silvera added.\nJPS\u2019 aid will also extend to the foundation\u2019s offering of educational grants to students in the parish for the academic year 2024-2025, the release said\nThe aftermath of the category 4 hurricane saw several residents plunged into darkness as flood waters and winds ripped through JPS lines and toppled poles in the parish. The utility company has since begun restoring electricity to parts of St Elizabeth.\nFollowing the passage of Hurricane Beryl, JPS said it has been delivering aid across the island to residents who have been severely impacted. So far, the light and power company has provided relief support to over 400 families in St Elizabeth, St Catherine, St James and Kingston and St Andrew. There are plans for JPS to provide ongoing support over the next couple of weeks, the release said.",

You may not have electricity, you may not have water, but don\u2019t let that create a mindset of doom and gloom. Let us take a positive attitude. Let us take an attitude of hope, and an attitude of resilience that we will recover from this stronger.\u201d\nIn the meantime, the Prime Minister extended gratitude to the Honourable Michael Lee Chin and the NCB Foundation for their leadership and generosity: \u201cOn behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica, I extend heartfelt gratitude to the Honourable Michael Lee Chin and to the NCB Foundation for their vision, generosity, and unwavering commitment to Jamaica\u2019s recovery.\u201d\nFor more information on how to donate and support Jamaica\u2019s recovery efforts, please visit disasterfund.opm.gov.jm.",

I think one of the concerns that I have going forward is that while we are cleaning up, we don\u2019t completely cut down and eliminate trees,\u201d said Rodriguez-Moodie.\n\u201cTrees play an important role in keeping the environment cool and many other things in terms of purifying the air. Oftentimes after these kind of events, you kind of think that they are so destructive or they cause so much issues, and some people take the route of not wanting to replant trees or not wanting to keep trees, but I think it\u2019s important that we understand the role of trees and continue to keep them in our environment,\u201d she told the\nJamaica Observer.\nThe Category 4 hurricane, which passed Jamaica on July 3, had strong winds that blew down trees, causing much destruction across the island.\nAccording to the National Works Agency, as of July 9, they received reports of 476 road sections islandwide that were blocked either by fallen trees or utility poles. The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) said that power supply was also impacted during and after the storm in several parishes due to trees that have fallen on power lines.\nAdditionally, a 26-year-old woman from Hanover was also killed when a tree limb fell on her during Hurricane Beryl.\nDespite the destruction these fallen trees caused, Rodriguez-Moodie wants focus on the environmental impact of felling trees.\n\u201cAfter a hurricane, when we are trimming the trees that have been damaged, it\u2019s important to not just completely massacre and cut back a tree because when you do that, you can also affect the tree\u2019s ability to grow back properly,\u201d she said.\nThe CEO further noted that the loss of trees means there are areas of land which are now open, making them prone to landslides and erosion, and further destruction of trees can worsen the situation.\n\u201cI think also when we\u2019re discarding, I want to caution people not to burn the tree branches because open burning is illegal and it can cause further issues. Other than the fact that you could potentially cause the fire to spread and damage other people\u2019s property, you could also cause health impacts as well in terms of air pollution,\u201d she warned.\nTouching on the topic of climate change and its impacts, the environmentalist said that while replanting trees must be a priority, it is important to plant the right trees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about replanting with something like a palm tree or something like an ornamental bush because they don\u2019t play the same type of role in the environment. The trees are important in terms of keeping the environment cool and all the ecosystem services they provide, but not all trees are the same, and so we have to not be focusing on the easier fixes,\u201d said Rodriguez-Moodie.\n\u201cTrees are so important, especially as climate change worsens and the place is getting hotter and hotter. We need to be considering this,\u201d she stressed, adding that replanting also protects the topsoil and prevent issues such as landslides.",

        "content": "title: Hurricane Beryl: Jamaica - Situation Report No.2 (As of 13 July 2024) \n content: This report is produced by OCHA in support of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Jamaica. It covers the period from 10 to 13 July 2024. The next report will be issued based upon operational need.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n- The storm caused significant damage to shelters, infrastructure including water, electricity and health infrastructure, agriculture and other livelihoods such as fishing. The most affected parishes were reported to be St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, Manchester,\nWestmoreland and Hanover, with impacts also reported in other parishes. Some 82 health facilities reported major damage. The Rural Agriculture Development Authority (RADA) estimates 45,000 farmers have been affected with the cost of damage estimated at US$15.9 million.\n- Many communities lack access to clean water as the piped water network remains non-functional for around 20 per cent of the population, relying instead on water trucking, bottled water, and stored water in tanks.\nApproximately 60 per cent of the population is without electricity.\n- Some 180 people remain in 10 shelters after their homes were destroyed. The number of persons staying with host families is unknown. Vulnerable groups, such as women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities, face heightened protection risks including gender-based violence (GBV). There is a need for psychosocial support for children and caregivers.\n- Several country-wide assessments are being conducted by the government of Jamaica to assess damage and needs.\nA country-wide initial damage assessment is being finalised by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) and the National Emergency Geographic Information System Team (NERGIST). The Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) is finalising a Jamaica Household Damage Impact and Needs Assessment (JHDIANA), with support from WFP and OCHA/UNDAC. Furthermore, a Damage and Loss assessment is being prepared by the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ).\nHurricane Beryl, the earliest Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, impacted Jamaica on 3 July, causing widespread devastation. Approximately 160,000 people, including 37,000 children, are in need of humanitarian assistance (UNICEF).\nThe storm led to significant infrastructural damage, with 82 health facilities reporting major damage and an estimated 1.9 billion Jamaican dollars ($12 million) needed for repairs (PAHO). The agricultural sector has also been severely affected, resulting in food shortages and financial strain on families. The Rural Agriculture Development Authority (RADA) estimates 45,000 farmers have been affected with the cost of damage estimated at around $15.9 million.\nHurricane Beryl has caused extensive damage across several parts of Jamaica, notably impacting the southern coast, including Clarendon, Manchester, St. Elizabeth and on the western coast including Westmoreland, with significant damage to homes, crops and infrastructure. The northern areas, such as Hanover, Portland, Saint Ann, Saint Mary, and Trelawny, also suffered damage, impacting hospitals and health centers and disrupting livelihoods. Westmoreland and St. James faced severe agricultural losses, particularly affecting banana plantations and coconut farms. The hardest-hit areas in the south and north are grappling with disrupted services and significant needs for food, water, and medical supplies.",

It is a sobering picture of widespread damage and destruction as authorities work steadily to restore services such as telecommunications, electricity, road, water - and a semblance of normality - to as many communities as possible.\n-\nThere was extensive damage to utility poles and downed powerlines across parishes. Impacts across the island also included Fallen Trees, Wind damage to infrastructure and roofing, Flooding and Storm Surges. Approximately 250 reports of blocked roads were received by the NWA.\n-\n02 deaths have been confirmed. 1876 people including elderly plus 113 children are in 275 shelters. Severely affected Perishes are- Clarendon, Manchester, St Elizabeth, St Catherine and Trelawny.\n-\nA joint UN mission comprising of UNICEF, WFP and OCHA visited Old Harbor Bay, Portland Cottage, Rocky Point, Alligator Pond, and Treasure Beach 06 July and witnessed many families in need of water, food, cleaning, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support.\n-\nThere are children in shelters who will have to stay there while their homes are repaired or rebuilt. UNICEF observed severe damage to some schools and a significant impact on the energy system, with communities likely to be without electricity for an extended period. The effects on crops and fishing are also evident.\nSituation in Numbers\n37,000 children in need of humanitarian assistance (UNICEF estimation)\n160,000 people in need (UNICEF estimation)\n1,876 People in shelters\n113 children in shelters (NEOC Situation Report #3)\n2 Confirmed deaths (ODPEM)\nFunding Overview and Partnerships\nTo meet the immediate response needs, UNICEF finalized its response plan and funding requests sent to key humanitarian donors (e.g., ECHO, BHA, etc.) for early response. UNICEF is also jointly working with other agencies under the leadership of UN RC/HC to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response. UNICEF estimates the overall funding needs to be US$3.5 million although this may rise considering that assessments are still ongoing.\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs\n-\nHurricane Beryl almost made landfall in Jamaica at 5:00PM, July 3,2024. As of Wednesday, July 03, 2024, southern, eastern and north-central parishes received periods of showers from the outer bands of the hurricane. At 11:00 PM July 3, 2024, the Hurricane Warning was discontinued for the island.\n-\nThe NEOC was activated at Level 3 ahead of the hurricane's impact and has been scaled down to Level 1 as assessments are being undertaken.\n-\nThe Prime Minister issued the Disaster Risk Management (Enforcement Measures) (Hurricane Beryl) Order 2024, declaring Jamaica as a disaster area in effect Wednesday, July 03, 2024, and this remains in effect for 7 days.\n-\nRCO activated UNETT and offered UN\u2019s support to the Government of Jamaica through Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade.\n-\nODPEM and other government agencies started rapid needs assessment on 05 July.\n-\nODPEM de-activated 108 shelters out of 275 shelters, and 1,876 people including 113 children are staying in them.\n-\nUNICEF has prepositioned technical assistance as well as water, hygiene and dignity supplies ready for delivery to reach the most vulnerable children and adolescents.",

Damaging winds ongoing along the coast, with strong winds moving inland,\" the NHC said, adding that Beryl was now expected to lose power.\nFollowing warnings that it could be a deadly storm for communities in its path, residents had rushed to board up windows and stock up on fuel and other essential supplies.\nRead also: Storm Beryl may regain hurricane force en route to Texas\nBefore daybreak, strong gusts and torrential rain lashed cities and towns such as Galveston, Sargent, Lake Jackson and Freeport, television footage showed.\nThe storm had strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane as it crossed the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall, but the NHC said it was now expected to weaken rapidly.\n\"Beryl is expected to weaken to a tropical storm later today and to a tropical depression on Tuesday,\" the NHC said. \"Steady-to-rapid weakening is expected as the center moves inland.\"\nHurricanes typically weaken as they move over land.\nLocated about 55 miles (90 km) south-south-west of Houston, Beryl was moving at 12 mph (19 kph) and was expected to barrel over eastern parts of the state through the day before moving into the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ohio Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday, the NHC said.\nActing Texas Governor Dan Patrick on Sunday declared 120 counties to be disaster areas ahead of the storm and warned Beryl would be deadly for people directly in its path.\nHurricane Beryl moves inland after making landfall in Texas, US in a composite satellite image July 8, 2024.

        "content": "title: Non-gun slayings rise, exposing deeper social wounds \n content: A slaying a week.\nA wave of homicides has sent the island\u2019s homicide rate soaring, with authorities expressing deep concern at the rising tide of bloodshed as some use whatever they can get their hands on to commit crimes against fellow citizens.\nAttorney General Dale Marshall highlighted the trend, noting that the latest victim, who was chopped to death in his constituency of St Joseph on Wednesday, represents the 27th homicide this year \u2013 roughly one per week.\n\u201cThis is the bloodiest two months we have seen in Barbados in a very long time,\u201d said a criminologist who suggested the violence has exposed deeper wounds in Barbadian society. \u201cIn the space of two months, we have had more than 10 murders. There was a point when we were having almost a murder a day.\u201d\n\u201cWhile firearm-enabled homicides throw our whole society into a state of fear, homicides by other means are no less devastating,\u201d Marshall told Barbados TODAY. \u201cWe have now had several stabbing deaths, another with a piece of wood, yet another with a hammer and now a chopping death.\u201d\nThe Barbados Police Service confirmed it is investigating the unnatural death of a man found at a home in Little Diamond, St Elizabeth. Inspector Rodney Inniss, the police spokesman, said the incident was reported as \u201ca chopping up by use of a cutlass\u201d.\nMarshall lamented that while the police service has strategies to address gun crime, they lack specific measures for stabbings and similar weapons. He called for a societal approach to tackle these offences, which he believes are unrelated to gang activity.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, the deaths by stabbing and bludgeoning are beginning to tell a tale about our society and a general descent into violence that has nothing to do with gangs and recriminations associated with the gang culture,\u201d the attorney general suggested.\nUniversity criminologist Vernee Sobers recommended that policymakers shift their anti-crime focus from conventional measures to a deep dive into street culture. Sobers, also a forensic psychologist and sociologist, argued that stiffer penalties, increased police presence, and church interventions would be ineffective.\n\u201cNow, everybody wants to be a bad boy, everybody wants to have a gun,\u201d Sobers explained. \u201cThe ones that were done by stabbings\u2026 when you are a 19-year-old assassin, the energy that you have to exert to kill somebody in that fashion is an exorbitant amount of energy.\u201d\nSobers emphasised the need to understand the evolving street culture, citing examples of young men brandishing guns on social media and making threats. She contended that traditional deterrents are losing effectiveness, as incarcerated individuals still receive basic necessities and maintain contact with family and friends.\n\u201cThe streets are going to reward them for being bad boys,\u201d Sobers added. \u201cWe have to look at street culture now. That is what it is. It is the culture, street culture, gun culture. So, how are we going to tackle street culture?

Thereby UN agencies be able to support to vulnerable populations. The UNETT, co-shared by UNICEF and WFP, will continue to support the RCO lead in the joint UN response.\n- UNICEF participated in two joint assessments organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) on 8th and 10th of July to the affected areas. These assessments were supported by the UN system.\n- UNICEF handed over 6000 units of 10L storage containers, four 5000L collapsible water tanks, 23 1000L tanks, 200 WASH kits for shelters, and 100 hygiene kits to the ODPEM from prepositioned stocks. The items are being distributed to affected communities.\n- 95% of shelters have been closed.\nSituation in Numbers\n37,000 children in need of humanitarian assistance (UNICEF estimation)\n160,000 people in need (UNICEF estimation)\n100 People in shelters (Local news)\n2 Confirmed deaths (ODPEM)\nFunding Overview and Partnerships\nTo meet the immediate response needs, UNICEF finalized its response plan and funding requests sent to key humanitarian donors for early response. UNICEF is also jointly working with other agencies under the leadership of UN RC/HC to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response. UNICEF estimates the overall funding needed to respond to children's humanitarian needs to be US$3.5 million, although this may rise considering that assessments are still ongoing.\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs\nThe recent hurricane has caused extensive damage across several parts of Jamaica, notably impacting the South Coast, including Clarendon, Manchester, and St. Elizabeth, as well as Westmoreland, St Catherine Portland, St. Thomas, Trelawny, particularly affecting agricultural communities. In response to the crisis, social workers are actively conducting comprehensive house-tohouse assessments to gauge the full extent of the damage.\nMeanwhile, the government is coordinating the distribution of food packages through Ministry of Labor and Social Security, ODPEM and NGOs, although there are identified gaps in coverage, particularly in certain areas needing assistance with distribution logistics.\nThe agricultural sector has also been severely hit, and damages are being estimated. In St. Elizabeth, the destruction of greenhouses has created an urgent need for seeds and irrigation systems to support recovery efforts. Communities are experiencing shortages of food and difficulties in accessing cooking resources. Some are resorting to coal stoves, but there are reports of coal shortages and price gouging, exacerbating the situation.\nSeveral communities are facing prolonged power outages that are affecting the water supply. The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) has indicated that restoring electricity in some areas could take more than a month. In response, there has been a call from the government for immediate support with generators to restore the piped water supply. The government has committed to supplying the necessary fuels. Meanwhile, lack of drinking water is a big concern; communities claim support to ensure the minimums required. The stagnant water in flood-prone zones has become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, raising concerns about the potential spread of vector diseases like dengue fever.\nHospitals and health centres along the South Coast have suffered significant losses exceeding 01 billion Jamaican Dollars (approximately US$6.4 mill.) leading to challenges in medication access and storage.\nFamilies are also grappling with financial strains, as they are forced to dip into savings meant for back-to-school expenses to cover house repairs. There is widespread concern about how these financial pressures will impact their ability to meet educational costs by September 2024 when schools will be opening. At the same time, pending the completion of the assessment, it is estimated that approximately 100 schools have reported damages from the hurricane, totalling around JD800 million (approximately US$ 5.1 mill.), primarily impacting roofs.",

        "content": "title: Hurricane Beryl: Jamaica - Situation Report No.1 (As of 9 July 2024) \n content: HIGHLIGHTS\n-\nHurricane Beryl made landfall in the Caribbean region, bringing winds of 140 to 160 mph, and becoming the 2024 Atlantic season\u2019s first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the strongest possible ranking of Category 5 in Jamaica. It nearly made landfall at 5:00 p.m. on 3 July 2024 in Jamaica. Strong winds and continued rains impacted entire communities, bringing about flooding and destroying houses and livelihoods.\n-\nThe Prime Minister issued the Disaster Risk Management (Enforcement Measures) Order 2024 on 3 July 2024 which remained in effect for seven days, declaring Jamaica as a disaster area. The government has since made an announcement that the focus would be on recovery.\n-\nOn 9 July, Minister Dana Morris Dixon from the Prime Minister\u00b4s office briefed the International Development Partners Group chaired by the UN Resident Coordinator (RC) on the situation and the Government relief efforts. Minister Dixon expressed appreciation on the support offered by the international community, and expressed openness to work together with the international community.\n-\nThe RC activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and reassured the Government of Jamaica that the United Nations stood ready to support. United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team has been deployed to Jamaica to assist the Government and the Resident Coordinator in the country.\n-\nTwo field visits have taken place to date. On 6 July, an inter-agency UN field visit was conducted to St. Catherine, Clarendon, Manchester and St. Elizabeth. The second field visit, organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), took place on 8 July in Clarendon. The visits indicated many families in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support.\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\nHurricane Beryl has impacted Jamaica most severely in southern coastal areas, with reports of damage to telecommunications and infrastructure, housing, public buildings and healthcare facilities. Communities remain without access to clean water, sanitation and electricity especially in Clarendon, Manchester and St. Elizabeth: 70 per cent of National Water Commission customers were initially without water. Service was restored to 30 per cent of customers by 5 July. Across the island, 275 shelters were activated, accommodating over 1,800 people in 156 shelters; the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) de-activated 108 shelters.\nInitial reports from local electricity companies reported 60 per cent of customers as having no access to electricity. Around 45 per cent of the population had power restored by 5 July. Restoration of power infrastructure was expected to take four to eight weeks in the worst affected areas, impacting livelihoods and services in the medium-term. Government reports indicate that the provision of health services is continued, although facing difficulties, relying on generators to maintain service delivery. Some hospitals are in need of generators. However, the generators do not provide electricity to all areas within each health facility, limiting their full operational capacity. Due to flooding and rains, there is a risk of outbreak of water and vector-borne diseases. Humanitarian access is a challenge due to flooding and debris from fallen trees, landslides and infrastructural damage. Access to remote and rural areas remains particularly challenging, with blocked roads delaying aid and restoration services.\nThe Resident Coordinator\u2019s Office (RCO) activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and offered the UN\u2019s support to the Government of Jamaica through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade. The first inter-agency field visit on 6 July, composed of UNICEF, WFP and OCHA/UNDAC visited Old Harbor Bay (St. Catherine), Portland Cottage and Rocky Point (Clarendon), Alligator Pond (Manchester), and Treasure Beach (St. Elizabeth). The second visit took place on July 8, organized by ODPEM with participation from UNICEF, WFP and OCHA/UNDAC. It visited Rocky Point (Clarendon). Further field visits to the affected areas will be organized in the coming days in support of ODPEM.",

Sales Manager Janice Crichton said more are on the way \u2014 good news in an active hurricane season that began with a bang.\n\u201cWe started getting calls from Beryl got named; and as they were tracking, and she was moving closer, and they realised that Jamaica was in direct line of sight, a lot of customers came in. They bought all of the portable \u2014 which is the smaller size \u2014 generators. They were preparing,\u201d she told the Jamaica Observer.\n\u201cWe had over 200 persons visit the store in search of generators [last Friday but] by this time the small, portable generators were sold out. What we had were the medium sizes and the larger-capacity generators,\u201d Crichton added. Hotels and villas were able to purchase the mid-sized and larger units. Now ATL is working to restock its Kingston, Ocho Rios and Montego Bay branches with a supply of portable units that range from 5,000 volt-amps to 13,000 volt-amps.\n\u201cWe will receive a shipment of generators this week, if not by [Tuesday], to meet the needs of those persons who were not able to purchase on Friday or Saturday,\u201d assured Crichton.\n\u201cIt was here on the island, just to get it off the port. We now have to manage when the stock comes in because you can well understand Ocho Rios branch has the same kind of activity. With all three branches putting demand on a container of generators, you can imagine that we may not be able to supply everybody\u2019s needs. We have ordered again for more to come in because the [hurricane] season is going to take us for the next five months,\u201d she added.\nCrichton said ATL may have to adjust, to meet changes in weather patterns.\n\u201cIt tells us, as a business, that we actually have to have generators \u2014 more than one container \u2014 arriving in stock and dispatched to the various locations way ahead of time because, who to tell, maybe the season can be earlier next year,\u201d she theorised.\n\u201cJune traditionally is the start but, based on what the indicators are with global warming or all the other activities that they\u2019re saying are contributing to all this abnormality, who says the hurricane season can\u2019t move up from May? As a business, we are prepared,\u201d Crichton added.\nATL Montego Bay was one of four suppliers that told the Observer on Monday that they had run out of generators for the home. At Best Value Supercenter in Hopewell, Hanover, a supervisor who gave his name as Richie said the last one was sold a day before Hurricane Beryl arrived.\nHe said almost two dozen were sold between last Monday and Tuesday.\n\u201cIt sold like hot bread. Even though we were sold out from last week Tuesday, people keep asking for it. We did not have much in stock. We sold 10 on Monday and 11 on Tuesday and that\u2019s it,\u201d Richie revealed.\nHe said they are trying to get new stock from their suppliers in China but these will take approximately two months to reach Jamaica, and the price will not be the same as it was pre-Beryl.\n\u201cThe price will definitely increase because of different variables such as the demand and the dollar,\u201d Richie insisted.\nHowever, ATL\u2019s Crichton is assuring the public that they will not burden customers with an unscheduled price increase during the hurricane season.\n\u201cATL will not be increasing any prices, that\u2019s for sure, because we have to protect our customers; this is a time of our greatest need. It\u2019s the same principle we do for air conditioning units. In the summer, when the demand is greater, that\u2019s the time that we actually put all air conditioning units on sale. It will be the same for the generators,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe will not be increasing anything above what we would have normally priced this at. Remember, a new inventory came in so it would attract new prices, but we\u2019re not going to be price gouging or taking advantage,\u201d she assured.\nThere have been reports or price gouging at other companies who offer generators for sale in St James. One woman complained of the price of a generator doubling from $40,000 to $80,000 within the time it took her to get cash from an ATM to complete the purchase.",

        "content": "title: $20-million lifeline for farmers \n content: $20-million lifeline for farmers\nIN response to the damage caused by Hurricane Beryl to farmers across Jamaica, United Way of Jamaica (UWJ) on Friday launched a Farmer\u2019s Rehabilitation Fund (FRF) with the aim of raising up to $20 million to provide immediate and long-term support to affected farming communities.\nBoard chairman at UWJ, Dr Devon Smith, while speaking during the launch held at the offices of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, said the entity is aiming to mobilise resources and provide financial support to affected farmers, specifically in the parishes of Clarendon, St Elizabeth, and Manchester who were more severely impacted by Beryl.\n\u201cThe Farmer\u2019s Rehabilitation Fund will facilitate access to critical resources including seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help farmers restore their livelihood. This recovery is not about rebuilding what has been lost, but it is about to strengthen the infrastructure [and] strengthen the capacity so that we can withstand the future challenges,\u201d said Smith.\nIn an attempt to attract funding from local and international investors, Smith said the United Way Worldwide on Monday launched a micro site to raise funds for Hurricane Beryl victims right across the region, with a section dedicated for people to contribute directly to Jamaica.\nHe added that the UWJ will engage in a number of site visits between July 16 and 25 and is aiming to start the distribution of tools and financial resources to farmers by as early as July 30.\n\u201cWhat I am indicating here is that we have an aggressive timeline and it is therefore important that everyone comes on board to ensure that they can support this timeline.\n\u201cEach passing day that we are not able to respond is each passing day that we are making it more difficult for the citizens of this country,\u201d said Smith as he urged private and public organisations to collaborate with the UWJ to strengthen its effort to provide effective assistance for local farmers through the FRF initiative.\u201cWe know the overall devastation that Hurricane Beryl has had on the agriculture sector, leading to crop and infrastructure damage, life stock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for our farmers. As a country we must be able to rally round to support our farmers, our brothers and sisters, those citizens who ensure we have access to food in our families and communities,\u201d he explained.\nWhen asked about the process farmers will have to take to benefit from this programme, senior strategist at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining Michael Pryce explained that representatives of the Jamaica Agricultural Society (JAS) and the Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA) have started to do registration in the communities and are assessing the damage. Pryce noted that all farmers affected will be able to benefit from the initiative.\n\u201cWe are not going to be restricting it to only registered farmers, everybody suffered damage, and we will be there\u2026that\u2019s a policy-level decision that I am making here, but I don\u2019t think as a ministry we would ever decide that we are only doing registered farmers,\u201d he said.\nPryce used the opportunity to encourage all agencies to join the initiative as they aim to help farmers replace other damages.\n\u201cI have been out there since Tuesday and farmers are there, and yes, they want to get back to their farming, but there is no roof and that is also of importance to them. I felt helpless, because as the Ministry of Agriculture we cannot say anything about rebuilding houses, but we have to partner with all agencies within Government to ensure the well-being of the farming population and their relatives is taken care of,\u201d said Pryce.\nChairperson at Seprod and Musson Foundations, Melanie Subratie, while describing the importance of farmers to food distributors across Jamaica, announced a commitment to donating $2 million to the rehabilitation fund.\n\u201cWe believe our contribution along with the efforts of United Way of Jamaica\u2026and other partners here today will make a significant difference in the lives of those affected and also the lives of everyone else who is dependent on agriculture all the way down the supply chain in Jamaica,\u201d said Subratie.\nUnited Way of Jamaica is part of a global network mandated to mobilising resources for the vulnerable and marginalised groups in the society, including education, health, and income-generating activities.",

        "content": "title: Slow going - Jamaica Observer \n content: Slow going\nConnectivity issues and other challenges impacting Government\u2019s Hurricane Beryl relief efforts\nTHE Government\u2019s Hurricane Beryl relief effort is being slowed by a lack of connectivity, and other factors, leaving scores of residents in communities most devastated in dire need of support.\nThe Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which is leading the Government\u2019s humanitarian response, says that while it has spent more than $50 million providing care packages and lines of credit to assist Jamaicans impacted by the storm, it is still working to reach those most in need.\nPortfolio minister Pearnel Charles Jr, speaking at a post-Cabinet media briefing at Jamaica House on Wednesday, explained that his ministry\u2019s assessment and relief exercises have been impeded by several factors including the inability to communicate.\n\u201cIt has been a difficult task. I myself have been on a street providing relief, returned to that street the next day to hear multiple persons say \u2018we haven\u2019t seen you, where have you been?\u2019 And we did distribution on that exact street, and one of the reasons is the team is moving as fast as it can. So if you are not there, we may not be able to provide the support to you, but they will return. The effort is to get across the network and to utilise as many community leaders as possible to work with the Members of Parliament (MPs). I know some have said \u2018listen, we\u2019re not hearing from the teams\u2019 that\u2019s because of the difficulty in terms of communication,\u201d said Charles Jr.\n\u201cWe understand your frustration, we understand that several children are now scared. We understand that several seniors are concerned about their medicines, concerned about where they are staying tonight. We are working assiduously on the go, 24 hours a day to make sure that we can provide you with as much relief as possible,\u201d he added.\nCharles Jr said the Government has so far assessed 2,000 households and distributed close to 6,000 care packages to families in need as part of its response and relief efforts.\nHe said that almost 800 tarpaulins and 500 mattresses have also been distributed. In addition, the ministry also provided 612 hygiene kits and 159 cases of water.\nNoting that the relief outreach is being done with the aid of several non-governmental organisations (NGOs), other partners and volunteers, Charles Jr called on other Jamaicans to join in the cause.\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to leaving no one behind and so we want to encourage all Jamaicans, particularly those who may be in a better position, to join in the work of rebuilding this nation. If you can assist, reach across, do not wait for a neighbour to ask. Many need the support, but cannot muster up the voice to say, \u2018please help me\u2019,\u201d said Charles Jr.\n\u201cThose who can volunteer, get out of your house and volunteer. Those who have supplies that can be donated, this is the time, not next week\u2026 today. Those who can offer their skills and expertise to help in this rebuilding effort, this is your opportunity,\u201d he added.\nThe minister said that teams from the other ministries including the local government and community development, education and youth, health and wellness, and NGO\u2019s such as Red Cross, and Food for the Poor, have been working alongside the Labour Ministry going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide and to deliver immediate relief supplies, and to conduct the initial damage assessments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging particularly because of those areas where communication is completely down. So for our officers that are going into, or who are in Clarendon, and some areas of St Elizabeth, they cannot communicate on either of the [telecommunication] providers. And so it has been difficult. So we expect that over the next couple of days, we\u2019ll be in a much better position to give more accurate data,\u201d said Charles Jr.\nHe thanked Jamaica\u2019s international development partners including the United Nation\u2019s World Food Programme, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) who have offered assistance in various forms, including technical support, supplies, cash transfers, and logistical aid, amongst others.\nCharles Jr also asked Jamaicans affected by the hurricane to reach out to the ministry if they are in need of assistance. They can do so through their local parish office or contact the ministry at 876-922-8000-9. They can also connect through the ministry\u2019s social media channels.",

The United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s call for a \u201cdata revolution\u201d to equip countries with data systems to track and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals has encouraged countries to invest in better data collection, analysis, and measurement tools. While the increasingly available data shines a spotlight on progress, it also exposes the gaps that remain, including in access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.\nConsider Amina, a 28-year-old woman living in a remote village in Southeast Asia. Pregnant with her third child, she faced a long journey to the nearest clinic. In her village, there were no skilled birth attendants, and emergency obstetric care was a distant hope. Unfortunately, Amina\u2019s story is not unique. I have met women with similar stories across countries in Asia and in the Pacific, and I have seen firsthand that these inequalities in access are widening not only between countries but also within countries.\nHealth systems are plagued by gender inequality and biases based on displacement and ethnic discrimination. Consequently, indigenous women like Amina are less likely to receive antenatal care, more likely to give birth as teenagers, and much more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes.\nThis raises the question: Are we collecting the data we need to truly accelerate progress? Who is still going uncounted and unaccounted for?\nData is not just numbers; it\u2019s the story of people\u2019s lives. It provides insights into the health and well-being of individuals. Quality data collection and analysis help us identify service gaps, understand access barriers, and develop targeted interventions for those often left behind, including women, girls, indigenous populations, people with disabilities, the LGBTQIA+ community, and older persons.\nIn a region that faces rapid population growth in some areas, rapid ageing in others, as well as widespread climate change, conflict, and crises, reliable population data is more important than ever. Inclusive and culturally relevant data, disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and other factors, is essential to ensuring everyone \u2013 every individual \u2013 has access to universal sexual and reproductive health and rights.\nData on maternal deaths highlights areas where healthcare systems are failing women. It can reveal shortages in skilled birth attendants, lack of emergency obstetric care, or socio-cultural barriers that prevent women from seeking timely care.\nData on contraceptive use and unmet need for family planning increases understanding on where and why gaps exist, such as cultural stigma or lack of education about contraception that can lead to high rates of unintended pregnancies.\nData on violence against women indicates the prevalence of this horrific act and how and where it happens, and the harms that result. For example, UNFPA\u2019s kNOwVAWdata initiative supports ethically sourced quality data to measure the prevalence of violence against women, while protecting confidentiality to ensure no further harm. Today, 32 out of 36 countries in the region have conducted at least one survey, providing quality data to inform how better we can serve those that need us most.\nBy breaking down data by age, geography, and socio-economic status, we can pinpoint barriers and address them through community engagements, awareness campaigns, improved supply chains, and policy changes to push forward those left behind.\nGovernments, civil society, and international organizations must collaborate to enhance data collection, analysis, and use. This includes leveraging new technologies, such as mobile health platforms and geospatial mapping, to reach and document underserved populations. It also means ensuring data drives decision-making at all levels, from local health clinics to national policy forums.\nData is the lifeblood of effective, equitable healthcare systems. It shows where we are succeeding and where we are falling short. It guides our actions and holds us accountable. Yet, people\u2019s lives cannot be summed up by a single statistic or reduced to mere data points. Humanity is a diverse tapestry of hopes and dreams, and it is by ensuring every individual is accounted for that we can fulfill our vision: a resilient and equitable future where everyone counts.",

        "content": "title: McKenzie dismisses mischief makers \n content: McKenzie dismisses mischief makers\nLocal government minister says Jamaica was well-prepared for Hurricane Beryl\nLOCAL Government and Community Development Minister Desmond McKenzie is insisting that Jamaica was well-prepared for Hurricane Beryl, dismissing as mischief makers critics who have said otherwise.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen, in this hurricane, the response of the Government of Prime Minister Andrew Holness. It would take somebody who has devious intentions to question the performance of the Administration,\u201d he told a post-Cabinet press briefing at Jamaica House on Wednesday.\nMcKenzie said he is wary of people \u201cwho for want of creating mischief to be giving false information and to be painting a false picture of the Government\u2019s response\u201d.\nThe Opposition, in particular, has been critical of the Government\u2019s readiness prior to the storm and its level of response in Beryl\u2019s aftermath.\nDescribing Beryl as a trial run for other weather events anticipated for the ongoing hurricane season, Opposition Leader Mark Golding said he was not pleased with the Administration\u2019s level of preparedness or response.\nDuring a tour of Alligator Pond in Manchester last Sunday, Golding said the Government needs to make greater effort in terms of its preparation for such disasters.\n\u201cThere are gullies, for example, that need to be cleaned\u2026We need to prepare for hurricanes in a more meaningful way going forward, not an announcement the day before of some drain cleaning or an allocation to MPs (Members of Parliament) which may take time to access. We need to have relief supplies and equipment ready to be rolled out in areas which are prone to being damaged. A whole different approach needs to be taken. We have lessons to be learnt from Beryl for sure,\u201d Golding said.\n\u201cI would have thought we would see more activity from the State agencies in the badly affected communities by now. I can understand a day or two of assessment but I think we are beyond that now and people are really starting to feel the effects of the deprivation caused by Beryl \u2014 no light, no water. This is the time when we want to see ODPEM (Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management) and the other State agencies showing themselves in the communities and delivering blankets, bedding, food items, water, and so on,\u201d Golding added.\nThe Opposition leader claimed he was not looking to politicise the matter in any way, \u201cbut where we see the gaps we want to call them out and bring them to the attention of the Government so that we can respond quickly to them. Right now people are hurting in many parts of Jamaica. The assessment needs to move rapidly [so as] to get relief to people.\u201d\nMcKenzie argued, however, that while not perfect, the Government\u2019s plan worked well and vowed to \u201cuse the lessons from this one to improve going forward. And I think that that is important because it is going to be difficult for you to plan in advance of a disaster.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBut what we can look at is the systems that work. And if you ask me how much of the system worked, I would say, I would say, nine out of 10 of what we put in worked, so we will improve on that. And I believe also, what is going to be important is that we are going to be looking to expand our public education. It was not lacking, but I think the more we develop and encourage and educate will help us to improve in the areas.\u201d\nMinister with responsibility for information Senator Dr Dana Morris Dixon agreed that the Administration is always working to improve.\n\u201cAnd so we learn from every single situation that we have and we make it better. And remember, we went through COVID and we learned a lot through COVID and a lot of the mechanisms being put in place, in terms of relief, came out of the learnings of COVID. And so of course, with this one, we\u2019re going to learn even more and be better at it,\u201d she said.\nShe noted however that one area the Government will have to look at is greater use of technology.\n\u201cOne of the things that has hampered a lot of our work as Government has been the lack of communication and the coverage from our partners. And we are speaking, as you know, to [telecommunications providers] Digicel and Flow on that area. A lot of them were dependent on JPS (Jamaica Public Service) for electricity.\n\u201cWe have to look at how we have other electricity-generation facilities that are in place. And so that\u2019s one area; we have to look at other areas of communication, how we build redundancy. So if the mobile network is down, what else can we do? And we actually have offers of assistance from overseas for mobile-type units that could be deployed in an area that loses connectivity. So there\u2019s some key lessons that we\u2019ve learned and especially just making the system more robust because as you saw, Hurricane Beryl was offshore and look at all the damage,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "title: Papal message of hope \n content: This coming week, Indonesia prepares to welcome the second pope to ever visit the country since 1989, who brings with him a timely message of peace, justice and humanity amid democracy's ailing health across the globe.\nhe impending visit of Pope Francis to Indonesia this week could not be more timely, coming as it does after a tumultuous period during which the country\u2019s democracy again rose up against an attempt by those with power to bury it.\nOf course, the pope is not going to address the democratic regression that Indonesia and its people have been enduring; nor does he plan to address the environmental and humanitarian disasters plaguing the country as a result of overexploitation of natural resources and rampant corruption.\nBut his visit from Sept. 3 to 6 speaks volumes about his stance in upholding the values of democracy and human rights, which adhere to no national borders or to a single religion.\nIn his address just ahead of the European Parliament election in July, the pope decried the current state of democracy and warned against \u201cpopulists\u201d that masked their greed for power.\n\u201cDemocracy is not in good health in today\u2019s world,\u201d he said at the time.\nThough he did not refer to any region specifically, Indonesian democracy certainly has been ailing in recent years, with the political establishment bulldozing popular opposition to controversial bills deemed to strengthen the power of oligarchs. But the nationwide protests on Aug. 22 forced the pro-government House of Representatives to drop its proposed revision to the Regional Elections Law, apparently initiated to circumvent the Constitutional Court rulings that aimed to uphold democracy.\nIn the eyes of the pope, it is not only democracy that is \u201csick\u201d but the Earth also. The latter is due to not only the world\u2019s addiction to dirty energy, as evident in the massive use of fossil fuels and nonrenewable resources, but also injustice, unfair labor relations and the concentration of enormous wealth in a few hands.\nThe Vatican has declared September as the \u201cSeason of Creation\u201d, when Pope Francis will call for protection of the Earth and solidarity with victims of environmental disasters and climate change. Although he has not made any reference to Indonesia, his message as a global leader should boost the morale of all groups and individuals who have worked hard and consistently to conserve nature.\nThe pope\u2019s decision to include the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation on his apostolic visit to Asia and the Pacific is highly significant for the advancement of interreligious relations in the country, as well as the promotion of interfaith dialogue on the global stage.\nIndonesia is deemed to represent moderate Islam, which coexists peacefully with democracy, and where minority rights are protected under the national motto of \u201cBhinneka Tunggal Ika\u201d (Unity in Diversity). It cannot be denied that Indonesia is a hotbed of terrorist groups aspiring to create a pan-Islamic caliphate in Southeast Asia, but law enforcement has kept them in check so far.\nIndonesia is also home to mainstream Islamic organizations, Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, which have been striving to promote Islam as a blessing for the world.\nBefore leading a congregational service at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium on Thursday, the pontiff is scheduled to visit Istiqlal Mosque and meet with Grand Imam Nasaruddin Umar to demonstrate commitment to interfaith dialogue. Pope Francis is to travel to the region\u2019s biggest mosque via an underground tunnel from Jakarta Cathedral.\nThe 33-meter-long tunnel connecting the two houses of worship was built in 2021 to symbolize the nation\u2019s plurality and religious tolerance, and is aptly named Silaturahmi (kinship).\nThe pope\u2019s Indonesia visit was originally planned for 2020 but was canceled due to the pandemic, which resulted in the deaths of 5.4 million people globally, including 144,000 Indonesians.\nPope Francis\u2019s Asia-Pacific tour will be the longest yet by the 87-year-old pontiff, who regularly uses a wheelchair, and he is poised to become the second head of the Catholic Church to visit the country after Pope John Paul II in 1989.\nPerhaps it is his enthusiasm for spreading the message of peace, justice and humanity that is fueling him to make a tiring journey.\nAs the country welcomes Pope Francis, Catholics and people of all faiths should be prepared to listen to his wisdom.\nShare your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you've encountered on The Jakarta Post.

        "content": "title: Kingston and St Andrew\u2019s hurricane losses put at $530m \n content: Kingston and St Andrew\u2019s hurricane losses put at $530m\nALTHOUGH sympathetic to other parishes that were badly hit, Andrew Swaby, the mayor of Kingston, is celebrating that his municipality was spared from the wrath of Hurricane Beryl, racking up only $530 million in estimated damage.\nHe said Kingston and St Andrew\u2019s estimated damage amounted to just over five per cent of the entire estimate islandwide, which was announced on Tuesday to be $10 billion.\nMayor Swaby was chairing Tuesday\u2019s meeting of the Kingston and St Andrew Municipal Corporation (KSAMC), the first since the passage of the hurricane.\n\u201cDespite devastation experienced across the island, Hurricane Beryl could have done far more damage. Assessment so far showed that Kingston and St Andrew fared reasonably well in terms of damage of infrastructure. For the most part, fallen trees, [and] landslides caused blockage to roadways. So far, at least one-lane access has been restored to most communities affected by blockage of roads. There were also reports of roofs being taken off by strong winds. Thankfully, there weren\u2019t many reports of flooding as in the past,\u201d the mayor told the meeting.\nSwaby also said there were reports of gully walls collapsing in a few urban divisions.\n\u201cPreliminary estimates for damage on our public infrastructure is about $530 million,\u201d the mayor said.\n\u201cThese include damage to roadways, drainage network, landslides, blocked drains, public buildings and other infrastructure that fall under the remit of the KSAMC,\u201d he added.\nWhile he was appreciative of the work being done by the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) and the National Water Commission (NWC) to restore the utility services they provide to Jamaicans following the passage of Beryl, Swaby said that a number of communities were still without electricity and water almost a week later.\n\u201cI implore these agencies to have these services restored as quick as possible,\u201d the mayor urged.\nOn Sunday, June 30, Swaby had called an emergency meeting with the staff of the KSAMC to assess internal readiness for Hurricane Beryl and to discuss the council\u2019s response plan.\nThat meeting was attended by Robert Hill, the chief executive officer of the KSAMC; the parish disaster coordinator; representatives of the poor relief department; the chief engineering officer; chairpersons; vice-chair; as well as high-ranking members of committees critical to preparing for disasters.\n\u201cComing out of those discussions, the temporary shelter for the homeless at our facility at 34 to 42 Church Street was reactivated. We also utilised additional bed spaces at the Denham Town Golden Age Home, the Desmond Mckenzie Transitional Centre, the Marie Atkins Night Shelter, and the Good Samiritan Inn. The following day on July 1, I called a disaster committee meeting. This meeting was initially scheduled for July 11, but had to be brought forward because of the threat of Hurricane Beryl. Our agency partners who usually attend these meetings as well as other stakeholders in attendance were asked to provide an update on their state of readiness,\u201d the mayor said.\nAlso in attendance were representatives from the National Water Commission, Jamaica Public Service, National Works Agency, Social Development Commission, Jamaica Constabulary Force, Jamaica Fire Brigade, Kingston and St Andrew Public Health Department, Ministry of Labour and Social Security and Jamaica Red Cross.\n\u201cCouncillors, you will agree that it is rare to see hurricanes develop so early in the season. This is in keeping with some of the predictions scientists have made regarding climate change and global warming. This underscores the need to always be prepared once we enter into the hurricane season. As the saying goes, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail,\u201d Swaby told the meting.\n\u201cAs is in the case during any major hurricane, our agricultural sector was badly affected. Parishes such as St Elizabeth, Manchester and Clarendon were the most severely hit. They saw major damage to physical infrastructure and agricultural produce. While giving thanks that we were spared by the wrath of the hurricane, we have to remember those who lost in neighbouring islands who suffered great loss, including loss of lives. As a municipality, we extend our condolences to the families in these countries and wish them success in their restoration process.\u201d\nThe mayor commended all who went above and beyond the call of duty.\n\u201cI say a big thank you, also, to the shelter managers and other community members who assisted with managing the shelters that were activated in the municipality. For them to leave their homes and families to take care of others demonstrated a deep sense of love and care for those in need. We must also thank the security forces, the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the Jamaica Constabulary Force and our own municipal officers as well as private security teams who were on hand to ensure the safety of all persons at various shelters. I must mention the JUTC representatives who were on hand at the command centre to assist with the transporting of persons to safety. Last, and by no means least, to my hard-working colleague councillors, my heartfelt gratitude to you for being in your respective divisions, assisting the residents and ensuring their safety. However, I must single out Councillor Charmaine Daniels, who after completing her rounds in her division, she, in her capacity as chairperson for the poor relief committee, went to the Marie Atkins Night Shelter and she rode it out throughout the night,\u201d he said.",

This is just my family come together and we a do this. Everybody got a touch in this hurricane, so we can\u2019t really lean on the MP, because people get it worse than we. We have to try and get back to business,\u201d said McKenzie.\n\u201cWe would love some help to get back some of our goods. We get back electricity, so fridge can run. They made sure that the street in Waterloo got back back electricity.\nHe said the devastation caused by the storm left a major blow on the economy in southern St Elizabeth.\n\u201cThe first storm Ivan took down my shop clean. This one came and gone with the roof. This is our livelihood, so we have to come together as family, gather our savings, and get the place up and running. Looters come and gone with everything inside, liquor [and] cigarettes. I lost over $300,000 due to the storm,\u201d he said.\nBeside McKenzie\u2019s shop other small business owners and vendors were helping workmen place zinc on their shops.\nRunece Wright, a resident of Parottee, a seaside village near Black River, attributed community spirit to the rebuilding effort there.\n\u201cWe haffi lift up all mi granny out of the house so that breeze nuh blow her away. People in the community came together who were willing to help and nail it [roof] up. People actually went around the community and fixed roofs, because there was a lot of damage. People got together and nailed them up,\u201d said Wright.\n\u201cThe hurricane was hectic, it came with a lot of damage. My shop blew down. The house roofs that weren\u2019t leaking during the storm were blown off. Everything mash up, from fowl coop to pig pen\u201d she added.\nUnlike Black River, Parottee and most of St Elizabeth remain without power, resulting in a setback for many. Wright said fishing has come to a halt.\n\u201cWe are not managing because this is our only source of living. Every pot mash up at sea, and even if we go fishing right now, we don\u2019t have the electricity to store the fish,\u201d she said.\nWright claimed her shop was also looted after the storm.\n\u201cPeople see things and take them up. When disasters happen, people see juice and other things and just take them up,\u201d she said.\nHowever, Wright wore a smile on Wednesday as corporate companies distributed relief supplies, including food, water, and tarpaulins to residents.\n\u201cI am very grateful, because I don\u2019t have much grocery at home, because we had to spend the money that we had. Everything [money] done now and we don\u2019t have anything to sell right now. I am very grateful for this package,\u201d she said.\nThe companies included Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) and the two main telecommunication providers, Digicel and Flow.\nAdvira Bennett, another resident of Parottee, was grateful for the relief supplies as she recounted the passage of Beryl.\n\u201cIt was so terrible. I was so frightened. If I didn\u2019t get rescued, I would get mash up. My furniture got ruined. I had to move to my son\u2019s house with his family,\u201d she said, while claiming that Hurricane Beryl was worse than Hurricane Ivan in 2004.\n\u201cBeryl was a more powerful one without rain. The wind was powerful. It nearly took me away too with the breeze. I haven\u2019t started to rebuild as yet. I need some zinc and Solitex,\u201d she said.\nPia Baker, senior vice-president for customer experience and commercial at JPS, said the company partnered with Flow and Digicel to take relief supplies to the affected communities.\n\u201cAs utility providers we understand and we appreciate that oftentimes we are the first ones to come into the community. About 88 per cent of our 692,000 customers have already been restored, but we do appreciate and know that [while] we were able to restore power to Black River recently, most of St Elizabeth is without power,\u201d she said.\n\u201cDigicel and Flow are here, because it has to be a very tight partnership. We have to power up first for them to be able to provide connectivity to the customers. Additionally, we do understand that it is not just about power. There is a lot of social relief that we have to come in,\u201d she added.\nChief executive officer at Digicel Foundation Charmaine Daniels said the organisation was willing to assist in the recovery efforts.\n\u201cWe are all about restoration, getting up light and phones, but most importantly looking and talking to our customers on the ground who have been suffering in the aftermath of Beryl. We know that a lot of people lost their roofs, unlike Kingston, so we have come down just to lend a hand\u2026 to build back communities,\u201d she said.\nWith telecommunication service still a challenge in St Elizabeth, CEO at Digicel Jamaica, Stephen Murad, said efforts are being made to restore connectivity in the parish.\n\u201cWe have almost 900 sites all over Jamaica. St Elizabeth itself has about 54 sites. The critical part is for us to get as many of them powered up where we can\u2019t. We refuel those sites. We have had our team here on the ground for several days,\u201d said Murad.",

        "content": "title: Beryl leaves $10.5-b road repair bill \n content: Beryl leaves $10.5-b road repair bill\nEmergency assistance coming for citizens severely impacted\nPRIME Minister Andrew Holness on Tuesday announced a new programme \u2013 Relief Emergency Assistance and Community Help (REACH) \u2014 to assist citizens who were severely impacted by Hurricane Beryl last week with food and other essential supplies.\nAt the same time, he said the Administration also faces a repair cost of $10.25 billion for significant damage to the country\u2019s road network, battered by the Category 4 hurricane for several hours.\nIn a statement to Parliament, Holness noted that while data and information are still being collected in the field, the preliminary assessment is that over 500 parochial roads have been affected in varying degrees.\n\u201cIn terms of the level of repair that will be needed and the cost, it is significant to our main road networks. We are still tallying the damage to the parochial roads and, as I give regular updates, these figures will become available. Many areas remain inaccessible, complicating our relief efforts, but the National Works Agency (NWA) advised me that there were 200 main corridors that were blocked and all blocked main corridors at least have been afforded single-lane passage,\u201d he said.\nTurning to the relief initiative, the prime minister said the major elements of the REACH programme will include the distribution of food and essential supplies, utility, water, electricity and telecommunications restoration, housing and reconstruction support and economic recovery and restoration of livelihoods.\n\u201cIn terms of the distribution of food and essential supplies, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security has been distributing care packages, containing tin foods, flour, rice, cooking oil and other items through their network of social workers. These care packages contain enough food for a family of four, for four days. By today (Tuesday), approximately 5,000 families would have received care packages. We are coordinating. We continue distribution of food, water, medical sundries and other essentials to citizens in the most affected areas,\u201d he said.\nHe said that this outreach is being done in the most affected areas and includes collaboration with organisations such as Food for the Poor, the Salvation Army, and the Red Cross to ensure that aid reaches those in need promptly.\nHolness said, too, that the Government has begun a rapid assessment of the extent of damage to housing infrastructure in the most affected parishes.\n\u201cBased on this assessment we will craft and announce a programme to provide support to households in repairing damage to their property, roofs, housing etcetera,\u201d he said, pointing out that the Government will not be able to assist every single Jamaican that has lost their roof.\nHe said there has to be a process that determines who is assisted and that process has to be absolutely transparent so that nobody can charge that favouritism or some skullduggery is involved \u201cwhy this one get and that one didn\u2019t get.\n\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m taking the time to properly think out the system to look at the experiences that we have had and to use what has worked in the past and what we can integrate with technology to put in place a system that will properly identify the needy beneficiary and not the greedy person\u2026We will ensure that this relief is non-partisan and transparent,\u201d he said.\nHolness said that given the demands and the needs of those impacted, all 63 constituencies will be provided with an additional allocation of $4 million to assist in the recovery effort. This will go towards emergency shelter and roofing. The Government had provided an initial allocation of $5 million for welfare activities, such as food distribution and other relief.\n\u201cThere are some conditions as with the first [allocation]. You must complete the expenditure of the first allocation. Remember we are in a tight funding situation; we can\u2019t have allocations not used. The completion means that all the documentation that is required for the audit trail is submitted. Once that is done then the second allocation of $4 million per constituency will be made,\u201d he said.\nHe said that while a flat allocation will be given to all MPs, an additional $3 million will be provided to constituencies where there is an assessment that the damage is higher.\n\u201cSo those MPS will be contacted. It is a transparent process. So it is the assessment of the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), it\u2019s the assessment of the utilities, it\u2019s the assessment of the public infrastructure, and so forth. So you will be informed if you are categorised as a constituency that is severely impacted,\u201d he said, stressing that the distribution of relief must be done by all members of parliament in a non-partisan way, adding that \u201cthere is no colour or affiliation in a disaster\u201d.\nAccording to the prime minister, while the rapid assessment is being undertaken, support will be provided to certain communities where virtually the entire housing stock has been destroyed. He said he has instructed the chief of defence staff to mobilise the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team, and other supporting units, including the engineers to cover areas such as Rocky Point, Portland Cottage on the south coast of Jamaica \u2014 where the damage is greatest \u2014 to assist with the rebuilding and recovery.\n\u201cThey will also be deployed to assist with the recovery in Hanover, particularly in the town of Negril and other areas coming around to Westmoreland. The deployment in southeast Clarendon will also spill over into areas of Manchester and St Elizabeth.\n\u201cThe initiative aims to not just rebuild, but to rebuild stronger and more resilient homes that can withstand future storms. Our efforts will focus on durability and sustainability. We do not want to merely put up makeshift structures or patch up roofs in a way that leaves them vulnerable to the next storm,\u201d Holness added.\nHe said that while immediate efforts are focused on providing shelter and relief supplies, sustainable recovery is only possible with the restoration of economic livelihoods, pointing out that farming and fishing are the main industries in the most affected parishes.",

        "content": "title: Jamaica CO HURRICANE BERYL Humanitarian Situation Report No. 2 7 July 2024 \n content: \u00a9 UNICEF/Donna Marie\n\nHighlights\n\nThe full extent of the destruction brought by Hurricane Beryl in the Island as it swept through the south-east Caribbean from mid-day of 03 July. It is a sobering picture of widespread damage and destruction as authorities work steadily to restore services such as telecommunications, electricity, road, water - and a semblance of normality - to as many communities as possible. There was extensive damage to utility poles and downed powerlines across parishes. Impacts across the island also included Fallen Trees, Wind damage to infrastructure and roofing, Flooding and Storm Surges. Approximately 250 reports of blocked roads were received by the NWA. 02 deaths have been confirmed. 1876 people including elderly plus 113 children are in 275 shelters. Severely affected Perishes are- Clarendon, Manchester, St Elizabeth, St Catherine and Trelawny. A joint UN mission comprising of UNICEF, WFP and OCHA visited Old Harbor Bay, Portland Cottage, Rocky Point, Alligator Pond, and Treasure Beach 06 July and witnessed many families in need of water, food, cleaning, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support. There are children in shelters who will have to stay there while their homes are repaired or rebuilt. UNICEF observed severe damage to some schools and a significant impact on the energy system, with communities likely to be without electricity for an extended period. The effects on crops and fishing are also evident.\n\nJamaica CO HURRICANE BERYL Humanitarian Situation Report No. 2 7 July 2024\n---\nFunding Overview and Partnerships To meet the immediate response needs, UNICEF finalized its response plan and funding requests sent to key humanitarian donors (e.g., ECHO, BHA, etc.) for early response. UNICEF is also jointly working with other agencies under the leadership of UN RC/HC to prepare a joint appeal for Jamaica to support the response. UNICEF estimates the overall funding needs to be US$3.5 million although this may rise considering that assessments are still ongoing.\n\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs\n\nHurricane Beryl almost made landfall in Jamaica at 5:00PM, July 3,2024. As of Wednesday, July 03, 2024, southern, eastern and north-central parishes received periods of showers from the outer bands of the hurricane. At 11:00 PM July 3, 2024, the Hurricane Warning was discontinued for the island. The NEOC was activated at Level 3 ahead of the hurricane's impact and has been scaled down to Level 1 as assessments are being undertaken. The Prime Minister issued the Disaster Risk Management (Enforcement Measures) (Hurricane Beryl) Order 2024, declaring Jamaica as a disaster area in effect Wednesday, July 03, 2024, and this remains in effect for 7 days.\n\nRCO activated UNETT and offered UN\u2019s support to the Government of Jamaica through Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade. ODPEM and other government agencies started rapid needs assessment on 05 July. ODPEM de-activated 108 shelters out of 275 shelters, and 1,876 people including 113 children are staying in them. UNICEF has prepositioned technical assistance as well as water, hygiene and dignity supplies ready for delivery to reach the most vulnerable children and adolescents.\n\nSummary Analysis of Programme Response\n\nHealth According to government reports, health services are assured, although with some difficulties. Most hospitals are currently using generators to maintain service delivery and operations. Minor damage reported for some facilities including leaks and broken windowpanes. All health facilities have at least 3 days back up of water supply. However, due to the rains, children and their caregivers are affected by water and vector-borne diseases. UNICEF stands ready to provide essential supplies for disease prevention, as repellent-impregnated mosquito nets, and water purification supplies. In addition, UNICEF will provide psycho-social support and referral for mental health to children and caregivers suffering emotional distress caused by the storm.\n\nNutrition Government authorities have anticipated difficulties for affected families accessing food with nutritional content. UNICEF will contribute to nutritional surveillance strengthening as well as prevention and treatment of most at-risk cases according to the national and international norms. UNICEF will also support the provision of Infant and Young Child Feeding counselling, including assistance and nutritional supplementations such as iron and folic acid, for breastfeeding and pregnant women. UNICEF will also support for micro-nutrient supplement, high protein biscuit to prevent malnutrition and nutrition packages for malnourished children.\n\nChild Protection Children in shelters are generally more exposed to violence and abuse and often require emotional support. UNICEF will establish 10 Child-Friendly Spaces in tent settings, equipped with recreational supplies. In addition, UNICEF will also provide GBV/SEA awareness-raising activities and services to children most at-risk.\n\nWASH 60% of the population are without power and 70% of the population are without water supply due to power cut across the Island. This number may change as some systems are back on operation, with auxiliary storage tanks and generator\n---\nsystems. Hygiene promotion will be a priority humanitarian need and UNICEF plans to deliver WASH dignity kits, cleaning kits to affected families, provide 10-liter water containers for proper water carrying and storage, and provide hand-washing stations in shelters.\n\nCash-based Programming, Families that have lost all their belongings and homes are highly vulnerable, especially in terms of securing adequate food and other essential supplies. UNICEF offered to provide assistance to the Govt through unconditional cash transfers in coordination with other humanitarian actors like WFP. UNICEF also plans to provide special food and hygiene packs to families of children with disabilities.\n\nSocial and Behavioural Change Communication to Affected Population and Children UNICEF planned to provide SBC messages in shelters, and through U-report, U-Chat platforms, youth networks, social media, and printed SBC materials.\n\nHumanitarian Leadership, Coordination and Strategy Response efforts are being coordinated under the leadership UN Resident Coordinator Office. RCO activated UNETT with Co-Chairing by UNICEF and WFP. UN offered UN\u2019s support to the Government of Jamaica through Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade. UN approached to the Govt with its support to be part of the detailed assessment team which will begin soon. On 06 July, a UN Joint Assessment Team led by UNICEF with OCHA, and WFP visited affected southern perishes of St Catherine, Clarendon, Manchester, and St Elizabeth to have an idea of the impacts on the ground. UNICEF offered to be part of the Govt. joint Assessment Team and planned to provide support for WASH, Child Protection, Nutrition, Social Protection and Health as well as delivery of prepositioned items like 10l-water bottles, water tanks for communities, hygiene and dignity supplies to reach the most vulnerable children and adolescents.\n\nPhoto: UN joint visit to Southern Parishes on 6th July.\n\nHuman Interest Stories and External Media https://www.facebook.com/share/p/5narjtX9TqrdKpC5/ https://www.facebook.com/share/p/77VSmCCZmdFPH5RW/ https://www.facebook.com/share/p/C1hNj6iqVVPEmR1Z/ https://www.facebook.com/share/p/DiF15sUKVR4y5pgo/ https://www.facebook.com/share/p/3UZvgXPd1qhrAgEJ/\n\nNext SitRep: 12 July 2024\n\nWho to contact for further information:\n\nOlga Isabel Isaza Representative Jamaica Country Office Tel.: +51997573214 Email: oiisaza@unicef.org\n\nMohammad Mohiuddin Deputy Representative Jamaica Country Office Tel: +1-876-279-8336 Email: mmohiuddin@unicef.org\n\nCamille Beckford - Palmer Emergency Focal Point Jamaica Country Office Tel: +18766186253;ext=6253 Email: cbeckford@unicef.org",

        "title": "The Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage Must Listen to Affected Communities",
        "content": "title: The Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage Must Listen to Affected Communities \n content: By Jocelyn Perry | July 9, 2024\nAs the second meeting of the UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage begins this week, Refugees International urges inclusion of affected communities in both decision-making processes and direct access to funds.\nTo support these goals, the Climate, Migration & Displacement Platform Steering Group and Refugees International hosted two virtual conversations with members of communities affected by loss and damage in the context of displacement and other forms of mobility to share their experiences, challenges, and best practices with members of the Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage on June 26 and 27, 2024, under Chatham House rules. We organized these discussions in response to requests from Board members to hear from communities affected by displacement and other forms of mobility\u2014as most members of these communities are unable to travel to an event such as a Board meeting due to financial and documentation challenges.\nDisplaced communities are often some of the most marginalized, whether living within their country of origin as internally displaced people or having crossed borders as refugees or through other pathways. Their access to political processes\u2014including climate adaptation\u2014as well as international financing mechanisms are exceedingly limited, though they are often more exposed and more vulnerable to climate hazards than other groups. For these reasons, many civil society organizations and members of affected communities are advocating to ensure their consultation in spaces of decision-making, such as the Board of the Fund, as well as their ability to directly access small grants from the Fund.\nThese conversations should open the door to future and ongoing consultations with affected communities that are more in-depth, allow for greater representation, and are organized by the Fund for responding to loss and damage.\nKey Takeaways\nContext matters. As regions and communities each experience the climate crisis and related loss and damage differently, the Fund must be both fit for purpose and flexible enough to offer a wide array of solutions to adequately tackle the crisis in each context. While specifics look different in each regional context that we heard from, across Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, communities have already experienced and are continuing to face loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods; loss of biodiversity, cultural heritage, languages, and practices; loss of access to ancestral homelands and community cohesion; and are experiencing psychological trauma. In light of this, both economic and non-economic loss and damage must be considered and addressed. We also heard about the importance of livelihood support to avoid the burden of debt, and the need to proactively include and support women and youth.\nTo understand and engage with these local contexts, participation by civil society and affected communities at each step will be key to improving on the experiences of other funds and developing a mechanism that is consultative and meaningfully engages with the experiences and expertise of those facing loss and damage to whom the Fund is meant to be responsive.\nOn civil society inclusion and consultation, the Board should:\n- Ensure outreach and communication with communities through civil society and national governments, in local and accessible language, and support climate education to facilitate meaningful dialogue and engagement with its processes.\n- Conduct ongoing consultations with civil society in between Board meetings.\n- Allow interventions by civil society representatives throughout Board meetings to foster true dialogue and permit constituencies to table agenda items as well.\n- Support participation by members of groups, such as migrants and displaced people, who are not represented by traditional UNFCCC constituencies.\n- Fund travel support to Board meetings for civil society participants from affected communities.\nDirect access to grants through the fund will be key for many local communities, particularly displaced communities, to receive support from the Loss and Damage Fund. Simplicity is key for communities to be able to access funds in practice, not just in theory. Affected communities stressed that the primary barriers to accessing funds are accessibility (of information, procedures, banking systems), organizational capacity, and time. Mechanisms must be simplified to respond to these challenges.\nOn direct access to small grants, the Board should:\n- Establish a small grants window within the Loss and Damage Fund that is directly accessible for communities, local CSOs, Indigenous people, and groups facing marginalization, such as refugees and other displaced communities.\n- Ensure that a substantial and progressively growing part of the Fund\u2019s resources is allocated to the small grants window.\n- Ensure the small grants window has simplified procedures and systems to ensure easy access, transparency and accountability, based on community-led and human rights-based approaches.\nFinally, funding must be available at the scale necessary to meet the needs of affected communities and operationalized urgently as communities have been facing loss and damage for years already. Grants should prioritize nature-based solutions and ecosystem restoration to maintain connections between traditional environmental practices and communities, respect Indigenous knowledge, support biodiversity and environmental health, and continue to build local resilience to climate change.\nBackground: What is the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage?\nLoss and damage is an evolving term within international climate negotiations and policymaking, largely meaning the negative impacts of climate change\u2014those that cannot be mitigated by emissions reduction nor adapted to. After decades of advocacy by civil society and many of the countries most affected by climate change across the Global South, the Fund for responding to loss and damage was agreed to during COP27, negotiated by a transitional committee over the next year, and operationalized at COP28 in Dubai in 2023. The Fund is a World Bank hosted financial intermediary fund, through which the Bank serves as interim trustee and host of the Fund\u2019s secretariat; the Board was appointed by respective Parties in early 2024 and first met in April and May.\nThe Fund\u2019s stated mandate \u201cincludes a focus on addressing loss and damage to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events.\u201d A key point for many community-based organizations from the COP28 decision that operationalized the Fund is that the World Bank must allow \u201call developing countries to directly access resources from the Fund, including through subnational, national and regional entities and through small grant funding for communities.\u201d A more detailed discussion of many of the key issues that the Fund must address and their implications is available from the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation here.\nWhat Will the Second Board Meeting Address?\nKey issues during this Board meeting include selection of the Fund\u2019s Executive Director and Board\u2019s host country, additional rules of procedure and 2024 workplan of the Board, access modalities, small grant funding modalities, and triggers/thresholds for the Fund (more on financial instruments here), and participation of active observers in Board meetings and other proceedings. The full provisional agenda for the meeting is available here.\nCivil society organizations have been urging the Fund to learn from and improve on other funds, in terms of both participation by civil society and access to small grants directly by communities. While they appear quite bureaucratic, the decisions that the Board makes with respect to the above issues will determine to what extent the Fund is able to achieve these goals.\nThe Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation provides more details on these key issues, and La Ruta del Clima has developed a more detailed look at effective participation in Board meetings. Throughout the week, the Loss and Damage Collaboration network will provide daily updates of the discussions and analysis.\nWhat Other Issues are Relevant to Loss and Damage?\nWhile the modalities for Fund access are critical to communities\u2019 ability to benefit from it, the larger issue remains \u2018filling the Fund\u2019\u2014that is, ensuring that countries increase their pledges of support to it and that they ultimately deliver on these pledges. As of COP28, the total amount of pledges equaled just 0.2 percent of the climate-induced losses faced by developing countries each year.\nThe Santiago Network on Loss and Damage is another recently established entity within the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, intended to catalyze technical assistance to avert, minimize and address loss and damage as well. More broadly, appropriate funding and action for adaptation to minimize loss and damage will also be essential, through work on the Global Goal on Adaptation, sufficient funding, and technology and capacity-building support for countries in their national and local adaptation planning processes. Finally, one of the top issues on the agenda for COP29 this year is the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate finance (NCQG). To continue to build to the necessary scale of climate finance for loss and damage, the NCQG must include loss and damage and prioritize grants and highly concessional loans.",

        "content": "title: Hurricane Beryl: Jamaica Situation Report No.1 \n content: Hurricane Beryl: Jamaica Situation Report No.1\n\nAs of 9 July 2024\n\nThis report has been prepared with the support of OCHA\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nHurricane Beryl made landfall in the Caribbean region, bringing winds of 140 to 160 mph, and becoming the 2024 Atlantic season\u2019s first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the strongest possible ranking of Category 5 in Jamaica. It nearly made landfall at 5:00 p.m. on 3 July 2024 in Jamaica. Strong winds and continued rains impacted entire communities, bringing about flooding and destroying houses and livelihoods.\n\nThe Prime Minister issued the Disaster Risk Management (Enforcement Measures) Order 2024 on 3 July 2024 which remained in effect for seven days, declaring Jamaica as a disaster area. The government has since made an announcement that the focus would be on recovery. On 9 July, Minister Dana Morris Dixon from the Prime Minister\u00b4s office briefed the International Development Partners Group chaired by the UN Resident Coordinator (RC) on the situation and the Government relief efforts. Minister Dixon expressed appreciation on the support offered by the international community, and expressed openness to work together with the international community. The United Nations Resident Coordinator activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and reassured the Government of Jamaica that the United Nations stood ready to support.\n---\nUnited Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team has been deployed to Jamaica to assist the Government and the Resident Coordinator in the country. Two field visits have taken place to date. On 6 July, an inter-agency UN field visit was conducted to St. Catherine, Clarendon, Manchester and St. Elizabeth. The second field visit, organized by the Office for Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM), took place on 8 July in Clarendon. The visits indicated many families in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support.\n\nSITUATION OVERVIEW\n\nHurricane Beryl has impacted Jamaica most severely in southern coastal areas, with reports of damage to telecommunications and infrastructure, housing, public buildings and healthcare facilities. Communities remain without access to clean water, sanitation and electricity especially in Clarendon, Manchester and St. Elizabeth: 70 per cent of National Water Commission customers were initially without water. Service was restored to 30 per cent of customers by 5 July. Across the island, 275 shelters were activated, accommodating over 1,800 people in 156 shelters; the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) de-activated 108 shelters.\n\nInitial reports from local electricity companies reported 60 per cent of customers as having no access to electricity. Around 45 per cent of the population had power restored by 5 July. Restoration of power infrastructure was expected to take four to eight weeks in the worst affected areas, impacting livelihoods and services in the medium-term. Government reports indicate that the provision of health services is continued, although facing difficulties, relying on generators to maintain service delivery. Some hospitals are in need of generators. However, the generators do not provide Rocky Point, Clarendon.

Due to flooding and rains, there is a risk of outbreak of water and vector-borne diseases. Humanitarian access is a challenge due to flooding and debris from fallen trees, landslides and infrastructural damage. Access to remote and rural areas remains particularly challenging, with blocked roads delaying aid and restoration services.\n\nThe Resident Coordinator\u2019s Office (RCO) activated the United Nations Emergency Technical Team (UNETT) and offered the UN\u2019s support to the Government of Jamaica through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade. The first inter-agency field visit on 6 July, composed of UNICEF, WFP and OCHA/UNDAC visited Old Harbor Bay (St.\n\nPortland Cottage, Clarendon. A man fixing his roof damaged by Hurricane Beryl, 6 July 2024. OCHA/Juliane Gensler\n---\nCatherine), Portland Cottage and Rocky Point (Clarendon), Alligator Pond (Manchester), and Treasure Beach (St. Elizabeth). The second visit took place on July 8, organized by ODPEM with participation from UNICEF, WFP and OCHA/UNDAC. It visited Rocky Point (Clarendon). Further field visits to the affected areas will be organized in the coming days in support of ODPEM.\n\nHUMANITARIAN RESPONSE\n\nUnited Nations agencies and their partners have been supporting the Government-led response to assist people impacted by the hurricane. OCHA\u2019s managed United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) deployed a team of 20 international experts that arrived in Kingston less than 24 hours after the disaster, from where they are working closely with the Government and aid organizations to coordinate the response and provide technical assistance to assessments and analysis.\n\nResponse by UN agencies:\n\nWater and Sanitation: Hygiene promotion will be a priority humanitarian need and UNICEF plans to deliver WASH dignity kits, cleaning kits to affected families, provide 10-liter water containers for proper water carrying and storage, and provide hand-washing stations in shelters.\n\nShelter: UN Women is working with IOM to strengthen shelter options and management in order to ensure that shelters are safe spaces for all, including for elderly persons and children, by utilizing facilities owned by partners. Children in shelters are generally more exposed to violence and abuse and often require emotional support.\n\nFood assistance: Families that have lost all their belongings and homes are highly vulnerable, especially in terms of securing adequate food and other essential supplies. Support to social protection systems, including potential provision of food assistance to affected populations through existing government systems and modalities and direct WFP assistance as required. Through interventions including cash-based transfers (CBT) and/or vouchers, and building on its current work in supporting on household damage impact and needs assessments, WFP is preparing to implement food assistance programmes through CBT interventions in close coordination with the government. Investments in CBT assistance are expected to be complemented through top-up of Jamaica\u2019s Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) policy for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Through premium top-up via the Canada-CARICOM Climate Change Adaptation Fund, the policy \u2013 if triggered \u2013 will direct a fixed percentage of a potential CCRIF payout towards providing cash transfers to impacted people via the country\u2019s social protection system. UNICEF offered to provide assistance to the government through unconditional cash transfers in coordination with other humanitarian actors like WFP. UNICEF also plans to provide special food to families of children with disabilities.\n\nFAO has deployed two emergency specialists to support disaster needs assessment and response and recovery planning, and it is exploring the use of agriculture satellite remote sensing data to support the impact assessments.\n\nHealth: UNFPA is ready to provide training to medical practitioners for provision of quality Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services in line with the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP)\n---\nfor reproductive health in emergencies, including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR) and delivery of interagency reproductive health kits. UNICEF stands ready to provide essential supplies for disease prevention, as repellent-impregnated mosquito nets, and water purification supplies. In addition, UNICEF will provide psycho-social support and referral for mental health to children and caregivers suffering emotional distress caused by the storm.\n\nProtection: UNFPA is deploying two experts in humanitarian coordination and gender-based violence to the region to support needs assessment and capacity building. Depending on the needs identified, UNFPA is available to strengthen capacity to provide case management services for differentiated needs of GBV survivors, women and girls\u2019 safe spaces, GBV risk mitigation activities, with focus on the most vulnerable populations in shelter, affected women who are pregnant and persons with disabilities (PwDs), dissemination of life-saving information about GBV, and coordination to update GBV service mapping and referral pathways.\n\nUN Women will provide relief supplies and services, primarily cash, that cater for the needs of women, men, boys and girls working with WFP to support key assessments and targeting of caseloads for multi-purpose cash, as well as utilizing other cash-based transfers for supporting women-lead micro, small and medium sized businesses, agri-businesses and community-based organizations. Psycho-social and self-care needs to address trauma, stress and anxiety being experienced post-disaster by the population will be supported through a Self-Care Toolkit to offer comprehensive psycho-social support to families.\n\nEmergency logistics: Upon request, WFP is also working with the government, through the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS) and the Humanitarian Assistance Committee (HAC), to support on coordination of logistics for the emergency response. This work will include technical assistance provided to the HAC in emergency supply chain management and coordination. This work may include support in the government\u2019s provision of food assistance through optimized systems and processes for preparation, transportation and distribution of food assistance packages.\n\nEmergency telecommunications: Given the widespread impact on telecommunications services, WFP has offered the government the deployment of the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC), which can offer internet connectivity services for humanitarian responders and/or affected populations with satellite backhaul and managed Wi-Fi distribution. ETC can also provide coordination, security communications services (VHF radio), information management, as well as services for communities such as community feedback mechanisms and chatbot. ETC can support the ICT needs of the response temporarily until local services are available.\n\nFUNDING\n\nThe United Nations (UN) has released US$2.5 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to address most immediate lifesaving needs in the areas of shelter, food security/cash transfers as well as water and sanitation. UN agencies, funds and programs, humanitarian donors and development actors are coordinating with the government to provide support.\n---\nHurricane Beryl has triggered the Government of Jamaica\u00b4s Tropical Cyclone Policy with the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) from the Contingency Fund and Natural Disaster Fund with a payment of approximately US$16.3 million. Additional funding mechanisms might be released if triggers are reached, such as the Canada- CARICOM Climate Change Adaptation Fund.\n\n3W INFOGRAPHIC\n\nFor more information, please contact: Jomain McKenzie, Programme Communications & Advocacy Officer, jomain.mckenzie@un.org Mari Sawai, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, OCHA, sawai@un.org\n\nhttps://response.reliefweb.int/latin-america-and-caribbean/hurricane-beryl/jamaica",
