This is significantly below the usual number of people reached by WFP, as a result of Israeli-imposed bureaucratic hurdles, lack of security guarantees within Gaza, insufficient border crossing points, and risk of criminal gangs looting humanitarian convoys in South Gaza. Forced population movement has also disrupted the capacity of partners to maintain operations and distribute to those in need.\n\u2022 While hot meals and the distribution of fresh bread through bakeries continue, WFP will no longer distribute food baskets through its general food distributions across Gaza in October as the flow of essential goods has been critically restricted.\n\u2022 The situation in the West Bank is deteriorating rapidly. Military operations continue to cause casualties and significant damage to civilian infrastructure. Increased violence, movement restrictions and economic disruption are severely impacting daily life. Civilians and humanitarian workers need protection, and access to affected areas must be ensured.",

The Commission is also facilitating the delivery of material assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Beirut.\nThe conflict has triggered unprecedented population displacement in Lebanon, with already thousands of casualties and injuries among civilians.\nBackground\nPeople in Lebanon, including refugees, were already experiencing high levels of poverty and food insecurity while having limited access to services.\nNearly 2 million Lebanese and Syrian refugees are estimated to be food insecure. This number is expected to rise further.\nSince 2011, the EU allocated over \u20ac971 million in humanitarian aid to respond to the urgent needs of the population, both Lebanese and refugees.\nAs the situation worsened for the broader Lebanese population, especially since 2019, EU humanitarian aid is being delivered both to Syrians and Lebanese who are most in need.\nThe EU also organised the series of Brussels Syria Conferences to address the needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in Lebanon. Through our humanitarian funding, we support vulnerable populations to meet their basic needs through health care, education, protection and legal services.\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

Over the course of the war, Israel has carried out several large operations there, only to see militants regroup.\nIsrael reiterated its call, from the opening weeks of the war, for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million fleeing to the south.\n\u201cWe are in a new phase of the war,\u201d the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. \u201cThese areas are considered dangerous combat zones.\u201d\nPalestinian residents reported heavy Israeli strikes across northern Gaza.

Saeed Abu Elaish, a Health Ministry medic, said he was wounded and bleeding.\n\u201cPray for us,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.\nLocal journalists said one of their colleagues, Hassan Hamd, was killed in artillery shelling on his home in Jabaliya. He had worked as a freelance TV reporter and his footage had aired on Al Jazeera and other networks. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death.\nAvichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, urging people to head there. Hundreds of thousands of people have already sought refuge in sprawling tent camps there with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Israel has carried out strikes in the humanitarian zone against what it says are militants hiding among civilians.\nThe latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is nearing 42,000, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",

This eventually led to the creation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, (UNIFIL) tasked with securing Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Lebanon.\n1982: The longest Israeli invasion of Lebanon began in June 1982. Much like this week\u2019s declarations, Israel said the incursion was going to be brief and limited with a mission to destroy the PLO.\nBut it resulted in a years-long occupation of southern Lebanon and Israeli troops bogged down in a protracted and increasingly unpopular war.\nIsraeli forces ended up initially taking almost half of Lebanon\u2019s territory including West Beirut. The operation resulted in more than 17,000 deaths, according to contemporary reports, and an Israeli inquiry into a massacre at the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila.\nThat investigation held Israel indirectly responsible for the massacre that was carried out by Israel-allied right-wing Christian Lebanese fighters. Israeli troops withdrew from West Beirut after that but continued to occupy southern Lebanon until 2000. That conflict also ultimately birthed Hezbollah.\n2006: In 2006, Hezbollah militants infiltrated Israel in a surprise attack, killing eight Israeli soldiers and kidnapping two more in an attempt to prompt a prisoner exchange.\nIsrael retaliated with a massive air operation followed by a sweeping ground offensive, which ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire.\nThe month-long war killed about 1,200 people in Lebanon, hundreds of them children, according to Human Rights Watch. Forty-nine Israeli civilians and 121 IDF soldiers were killed, according to the Israeliu military.\nA UN commission found the IDF used \u201cexcessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate\u201d force against civilians.",

Such attacks have become an almost daily event. In the last 72 hours alone, at least 6 schools serving as IDP shelters were struck resulting in tens of fatalities, including children and women. In addition, in the early hours of 2 October, the Israeli military reportedly struck Al Amal Institute for Orphans, which was also serving as an IDP shelter in west Gaza City, killing at least 6 Palestinians. In September alone, our office recorded at least 14 schools struck in Gaza by the Israeli military, and in August one school attack every other day.\nIrrespective of whether Palestinian armed groups were present in these facilities, the resulting high rate of civilian casualties makes it difficult to conceive that such strikes are proportionate according to the principles of international humanitarian law. These attacks have long-term impacts on the civilian population, destroying the only viable shelters remaining for the more than one million Palestinians who have been forcibly displaced into an unsafe, unilaterally declared \"humanitarian zone\" where there is little or no access to life-saving essential humanitarian assistance. With winter fast approaching, the majority of Palestinians in Gaza are now forced to live in tents and other makeshift shelters where they are at risk of exposure to the elements. Israel, as the occupying power, must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law to ensure the provision of food, medical supplies and shelter for the population of Gaza, as ordered by the International Court of Justice in its Order on provisional measures under the case on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip.\nThe UN Human Rights Office reminds Palestinian armed group members that using the presence of civilians to shield themselves from attack constitutes a violation of IHL; Palestinian armed groups must cease and refrain from any such use and take all feasible precautions to protect civilians under their control from the effects of hostilities. In any event, any such use would not affect the requirement for the Israeli military to strictly comply with the fundamental IHL principles of proportionality, distinction and precautions in attack.\n#ENDS\nFor more information and media requests, please contact:\nUN Human Rights office at ohchr-opt@un.org",

        "content": "title: ACAPS Briefing note: Lebanon - Escalation of hostilities: key humanitarian developments (01 October 2024) \n content: CRISIS IMPACT OVERVIEW\n\u2022 Hostilities and clashes between Hezbollah and Israel have been escalating since 8 October 2023, mainly affecting areas in southern Lebanon. On 23 September 2024, the Israeli army increased their military attacks, with over 330 raids targeting over 117 towns and cities in southern Lebanon (South and Nabatiye governorates), Bekaa governorate, and the southern suburbs of Beirut city in Beirut governorate (Euro-Med Monitor 23/09/2024; OCHA 25/09/2024). On 24 September, another Israeli air strike targeted a residential area in a southern Beirut suburb, killing at least six people and injuring 15 others (AJ 24/09/2024). In response, Hezbollah has escalated their attacks, firing over 100 rockets at areas close to Haifa city, northern Israel, on 22 September, with no casualties reported. This came after a cyberattack on communication devices, resulting in killing of 9 people and more than 3,000 injuries. Hezbollah and the Lebanese Government accused Israel of plotting (AP 22/09/2024 ; AJ 18/09/2024). On 30 September, the Israeli army announced the start of ground raids into villages in southern Lebanon (AJ 01/10/2024; BBC 01/10/2024).\n\u2022 By 27 September, Israeli strikes on 23 September had killed at least 700 people, including at least 50 children, 94 women, 18 paramedics, 103 Syrian refugees, and two UN staff. The attacks had also injured at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians (AJ 25/09/2024 a; BBC 25/09/2024 a; OCHA 27/09/2024; Sharika wa Laken Instagram 26/09/2024). Since 8 October, Israeli air strikes killed a total of 1,640 people and injured 8,000 (OCHA 30/09/2024).\n\u2022 There are varying estimates for the number of IDPs since the escalation, as various sources provide differing information. As per IOM, the hostilities had newly displaced more than 90,500 people from the targeted governorates to Beirut governorate and other areas of northern Lebanon by 25 September (OCHA 25/09/2024; IOM 25/09/2024). This brings the total number of people displaced since 8 October 2023 to over 211,300 (IOM 26/09/2024).\n\u2022 On the other hand, the Lebanese foreign minister estimates that by 25 September 2024, the total number of IDPs in Lebanon had reached 500,000 (Sky News 25/09/2024; AJ 25/09/2024 b). On 29 September, the Prime Minister of the caretaker Government updated this figure to a total of one million people displaced since 8 October 2023 (Annahar 29/09/2024; AJ 29/09/2024).\n\u2022 By 30 September, around 100,000 Syrian refugees and Lebanese people had crossed into Syria, with many other families left attempting to cross at the border (UN 30/09/2024).",

Several armed fighters, masked and dressed in black, attended the funeral, an AFP journalist reported.\n\u201cWe hope that all Palestinian people will join hands, as we have one cause,\u201d Nasser Kharyoush, a father of one of the victims of the raid, told AFP.\nTulkarem was one of the towns and Palestinian refugee camps targeted during a large-scale Israeli military operation in late August against based in the West Bank.\nViolence in the West Bank has surged alongside the war in Gaza which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7.\nSince the Hamas attack, Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 701 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nAt least 24 Israelis, including members of the security forces, have been killed in Palestinian attacks during the same period, Israeli officials say.\nThe United Nations rights office said Thursday\u2019s strike came when there were \u201cno clashes or confrontations\u201d at the site.\n\u201cThe air strike completely destroyed the targeted building and also damaged nearby houses,\u201d it said. \u201cMore fatalities may be trapped under the rubble, but recovery and identification are proving difficult in light of the massive impact of the blast.\u201d\nMajor Israeli operations in the West Bank are sometimes occurring \u201cat a scale not witnessed in the last two decades,\u201d United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said last month.\nIsrael has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and its forces regularly make incursions into Palestinian communities.

        "content": "title: UN Human Rights in Occupied Palestinian Territory \n content: UN Human Rights in Occupied Palestinian Territory\n\nRamallah 3 October 2024\n\nStrikes on internally displaced persons shelters - Gaza\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office calls on the Israeli military to immediately end the pattern of strikes in Gaza on buildings acting as shelters for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). Such attacks have become an almost daily event. In the last 72 hours alone, at least 6 schools serving as IDP shelters were struck resulting in tens of fatalities, including children and women. In addition, in the early hours of 2 October, the Israeli military reportedly struck Al Amal Institute for Orphans, which was also serving as an IDP shelter in west Gaza City, killing at least 6 Palestinians. In September alone, our office recorded at least 14 schools struck in Gaza by the Israeli military, and in August one school attack every other day.\n\nIrrespective of whether Palestinian armed groups were present in these facilities, the resulting high rate of civilian casualties makes it difficult to conceive that such strikes are proportionate according to the principles of international humanitarian law. These attacks have long-term impacts on the civilian population, destroying the only viable shelters remaining for the more than one million Palestinians who have been forcibly displaced into an unsafe, unilaterally declared \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d where there is little or no access to life-saving essential humanitarian assistance. With winter fast approaching, the majority of Palestinians in Gaza are now forced to live in tents and other makeshift shelters where they are at risk of exposure to the elements. Israel, as the occupying power, must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law to ensure the provision of food, medical supplies and shelter for the population of Gaza, as ordered by the International Court of Justice in its Order on provisional measures under the case on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office reminds Palestinian armed group members that using the presence of civilians to shield themselves from attack constitutes a violation of IHL; Palestinian armed groups must cease and refrain from any such use and take all feasible precautions to protect civilians under their control from the effects of hostilities. In any event, any such use would not affect the requirement for the Israeli military to strictly comply with the fundamental IHL principles of proportionality, distinction and precautions in attack.\n\n#ENDS\n\nFor more information and media requests, please contact: UN Human Rights office at ohchr-opt@un.org\n\nTag and share Twitter @OHCHR_Palestine Facebook UN Human Rights Palestine",

Here, Dr. Safi describes what he misses about life in Gaza before the war that began last October, and the uncertain future.\nDr. Sohaib Safi:\nBefore the war, life in Gaza was generally difficult. But on a personal level, things were stable. I had my small family; my daughter Rita and my wife Nour, my parents and my brother as well. I dreamed of owning a house and a car.\nI enrolled my daughter in kindergarten for a joyful childhood and education. We used to laugh and joke with my parents, we\u2019d go out to restaurants and take Rita to play at Kids Land. We were happy despite the general anxiety. I had ambitions to learn and travel, I played oud and sang for my homeland, about life and love.\nMy daughter, who is now in Egypt, tells me every day that she misses me, and I tell her every day: God willing, I will come to you soon. But the truth is, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to see them again, I don\u2019t even know if I will survive.\nDR. SOHAIB SAFI\nWhen the war started, everything changed. We were displaced on the first day. The house was no longer ours. The place no longer felt like home. We lived through days and nights of fear, constantly feeling that death could come at any moment. Every day, I wished the war would end.\nAt around 4 a.m. [one day], I was sitting at the kitchen table when suddenly I felt an explosion right in front of me. I was literally thrown into the air and started hearing screams. The place was dark and full of dust and it was hard to breathe.\nI rushed to check on my daughter and family. They were scared but unharmed.\nAll I could feel was the taste of blood in my mouth. I realized that I was injured very close to my right eye and my nose, and other parts of my face, on my right eyebrow and my nose. I will always remember that day, the shock and pain, and my daughter\u2019s words when she asked: \u201cWhy is daddy bleeding? He\u2019s the one who saves others.\u201d\nNow I am alone with my parents. Between me, Rita, and my wife there are borders and tanks, the army, destruction, and war. Everything is uncertain. My daughter, who is now in Egypt, tells me every day that she misses me, and I tell her every day: God willing, I will come to you soon. But the truth is, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to see them again, I don\u2019t even know if I will survive.",

It circulated photos and video footage showing a column of tanks heading toward the area.\nIsraeli forces encircled Jabaliya as warplanes struck militant sites inside, the military said. Over the course of the war, Israel has carried out several large operations there, only to see militants regroup.\nIsrael reiterated its call, from the opening weeks of the war, for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million fleeing to the south.\n\u201cWe are in a new phase of the war,\u201d the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. \u201cThese areas are considered dangerous combat zones.\u201d\nPalestinian residents reported heavy Israeli strikes across northern Gaza. The Civil Defense \u2014 first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government \u2014 said several homes and buildings had been hit and they were not able to reach them because of the bombardment.\nResidents posted about the airstrikes and mourned their relatives on social media. Imad Alarabid said in a Facebook post that an airstrike on his home in Jabaliya killed a dozen family members, including his parents. Saeed Abu Elaish, a Health Ministry medic, said he was wounded and bleeding.\n\u201cPray for us,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.\nLocal journalists said one of their colleagues, Hassan Hamd, was killed in artillery shelling on his home in Jabaliya. He had worked as a freelance TV reporter and his footage had aired on Al Jazeera and other networks. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death.\nAvichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli military, said it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, urging people to head there. Hundreds of thousands of people have already sought refuge in sprawling tent camps there with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Israel has carried out strikes in the humanitarian zone against what it says are militants hiding among civilians.\nThe latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is nearing 42,000, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.\nThe very fact that they are issuing evacuation orders all the time just goes to show that they are attempting to avoid civilian casualties.\nWhy are so many Gazans killed and wounded? Perhaps, almost certainly, it is because despite Hamas receiving million of $'s over the years they did not spend a single cent to build bomb shelters for the population, whereas Israel has thousands of these shelters minimalizing the number of Israeli casualties from rockets and shells.",

Following the relentless pace of expanding conflict, destruction, and death is both mind-bending and soul-crushing for anyone with some sort of connection to the region or who cares about the wellbeing of its people.\nAmid the torrent, the fact that Israel has been waging total war against the entirety of the Gaza Strip and its population for one year now is at risk of somehow \u2013 unimaginably \u2013 being overshadowed.\nWhere is the time to take stock of what has already happened?\nOn 7 October last year, the Palestinian political and militant group Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2006, launched an unprecedented attack into Israel, killing around 1,200 people \u2013 including many civilians \u2013 taking around 250 hostages, and shattering Israelis' sense of security and trust in their armed forces and intelligence agencies.\nAlmost immediately, Israel responded by unleashing one of the most devastating bombing campaigns in history on Gaza and completely besieging the enclave. The months that followed have seen repeated ground invasions, the continuation of relentless bombing, and only the slightest easing of the siege to allow in utterly inadequate amounts of aid and commercial goods.\nThe only brief pause in the war was negotiated at the end of November last year to allow for Hamas to release 110 hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners, and saw Israel momentarily allowing more aid into Gaza.\nOther than that, the onslaught has continued unabated with repeated rounds of ceasefire talks coming to naught, reportedly largely due to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s insistence on achieving what he calls \u201ctotal victory\u201d.\nThe failure \u2013 or refusal \u2013 to reach a ceasefire has paved the way for the current regional escalation and a seemingly unending war in Gaza, where more than 41,700 people have been killed in the past year \u2013 including over 16,000 children. A further nearly 100,000 people have been wounded, and over 10,000 are missing and presumed dead underneath the rubble, according to health authorities in the enclave.\nAround 1.9 million people \u2013 90% of the population \u2013 have been forcibly displaced from their homes, many multiple times, and almost half a million people are facing catastrophic food insecurity while Gaza\u2019s critical infrastructure, housing stock, economy, farmland, and fishing fleets have largely been laid to waste.\nThe totality of devastation has prompted multiple warnings from the UN and other monitoring groups that Israel\u2019s actions are making Gaza unlivable. One year on, the overwhelming question is when and how will Israel\u2019s war end, and what will be left when it is over?\nBelow is a collection of our coverage, chronicling the humanitarian impact of Israel\u2019s assault, the factors stymying aid efforts, and the human experience of living through the war, as told by Palestinians for whom Gaza is home.",

But it's not just about my family \u2013 it\u2019s about the hundreds of thousands in Gaza enduring the worst horrors the world has ever seen,\" he added.\nYousaf, known for his strong advocacy for human rights, is part of growing calls from global leaders and activists for an immediate cease-fire and urgent humanitarian assistance for the people of Gaza, as the situation continues to escalate into what many fear could be a prolonged conflict.\nFlouting a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire, Israel has continued its relentless offensive on the Gaza Strip following an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas last October.\nIn the year since, more than 41,800 people have since been killed, most of them women and children, and nearly 97,000 others injured, according to local health authorities.\nThe Israeli onslaught has displaced almost the entire population of the territory amid an ongoing blockade that has led to severe shortages of food, clean water, and medicine.\nIsrael also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its actions in Gaza.Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

This comes in addition to the \u20ac10 million already announced on 29 September and brings total EU humanitarian assistance to the country to over \u20ac104 million this year.\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: \u201cI am extremely concerned by the constant escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

The Commission is also facilitating the delivery of material assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Beirut.\nThe conflict has triggered unprecedented population displacement in Lebanon, with already thousands of casualties and injuries among civilians.\nBackground\nPeople in Lebanon, including refugees, were already experiencing high levels of poverty and food insecurity while having limited access to services.\nNearly 2 million Lebanese and Syrian refugees are estimated to be food insecure. This number is expected to rise further.\nSince 2011, the EU allocated over \u20ac971 million in humanitarian aid to respond to the urgent needs of the population, both Lebanese and refugees.\nAs the situation worsened for the broader Lebanese population, especially since 2019, EU humanitarian aid is being delivered both to Syrians and Lebanese who are most in need.\nThe EU also organised the series of Brussels Syria Conferences to address the needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in Lebanon. Through our humanitarian funding, we support vulnerable populations to meet their basic needs through health care, education, protection and legal services.\nFor More Information\nQuote(s)\nI am extremely concerned by the constant escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

        "content": "title: MAG partners with local NGO to keep people safe from explosive ordnance in Gaza \n content: Five risk education teams have begun delivery of life-saving messages to residents in Gaza thanks to a partnership between MAG and a local youth organisation.\nThe partnership has been launched as relentless bombardment from both air and land continues to devastate the territory, claiming lives, displacing thousands and destroying homes and critical infrastructure.\nToday, around 90% of Gaza\u2019s 2.1 million residents are displaced, and 60% of residential buildings are damaged. The ongoing conflict, insecurity, and the threat of unexploded bombs pose significant challenges for humanitarian access.\nWhile the full extent of contamination is difficult to assess due to limited access, many of the hundreds of thousands of missiles, grenades, shells and mortars that have been fired into Gaza over the last 12 months may have failed to explode, leaving behind an immediate threat to life, and a long-term barrier to any hope of rebuilding.\nThat\u2019s why, since the escalation in hostilities last year, MAG\u2019s top priority has been practical action \u2013 focusing on what can be done to help keep people safe now, while preparing for a broader, coordinated mine action response to deal with unexploded ordnance when the situation allows.\nMAG has now partnered with Save Youth Future Society (SYFS), a non-profit, independent youth organisation, with over four years of experience in delivering risk education in Gaza. Uniquely positioned to access affected communities and IDP camps, their strong connections with organisations providing essential humanitarian aid will ensure risk education reaches those who need it most.\nIn collaboration with SYFS and funded by the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR), MAG\u2019s Explosive Ordnance Risk Education consultant has trained five teams, who have now begun delivering in-person risk education sessions to affected communities, with the aim of reaching 80,000 people in the next six months.\nThe sessions equip people with the tools and knowledge needed to recognise, avoid, and report possible hazards and respond safely to potentially dangerous situations.\nMAG is also launching risk education training for humanitarian workers, supporting colleagues across the broader humanitarian response with critical advice to help keep them safe while delivering their activities.\nWith no formal clearance operations yet underway, risk education is the most urgent and vital intervention to protect civilians and humanitarian workers alike. These new activities will expand the scope and impact of MAG\u2019s response.\nSince 2022, MAG has been working with the United Nations Mine Action Service to disseminate risk education via social media. Since 7th October, we have developed a stream of digital content, addressing emerging threats, including white phosphorus munitions.\nBetween June and August alone, MAG's digital campaigns on Facebook and Instagram reached 870,000 people and generated over 700,000 engagements. These messages highlight the dangers of explosive remnants of war, identify hazardous areas, and promote safe behaviours that can reduce risk in an increasingly contaminated environment.\nToday in Gaza, we remain committed to strengthening our response and will continue to do everything possible to limit casualties by providing critical safety information that can help save lives.\nSupport for this project was provided by a grant from UMCOR.",

They also cited a study published in the medical journal Lancet in July that said the death toll in Gaza has already surpassed 118,000, more than 5% of Gaza's population.\n\"Every day I saw babies die. They had been born healthy. Their mothers were so malnourished that they could not breastfeed, and we lacked formula or clean water to feed them, so they starved,\" said Asma Taha, a pediatric nurse practitioner, as quoted in the letter.\n\"Gaza was the first time I held a baby\u2019s brains in my hand. The first of many,\" Dr. Mark Perlmutter, an orthopedic and hand surgeon, said in the letter.\nDoctors said in the letter that Israel\u2019s \"continued, repeated\" displacement of the malnourished and sick population of Gaza, half of whom are children, to areas without running water or even toilets available is \"absolutely shocking.\u201d\n\"It is impossible that such widespread shooting of young children throughout Gaza, sustained over the course of an entire year, is accidental or unknown to the highest Israeli civilian and military authorities,\" they said.\nThe group demanded that the Biden administration support an international arms embargo on both Israel and Palestinian groups until a permanent cease-fire is reached and both Israeli and Palestinian hostages are released. The signatories also asked for a meeting with Biden and Harris to discuss what they saw and why they feel American policy in the Middle East \"must change immediately.\"\nThey also reiterated their calls in their July 25 letter, including reopening the Rafah crossing to allow humanitarian aid, including water and medical supplies, into Gaza.\n\"Every day that we continue supplying weapons and munitions to Israel is another day that women are shredded by our bombs and children are murdered with our bullets,\" they said.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

Out of this, 20,241 (6.6%) were admitted for malnutrition treatment, including 4,437 (1.4%) with severe acute malnutrition, and 15,804 (5.2%) admitted due to moderate malnutrition.\n- Four severe acute malnutrition stabilization centers (SAM SC) are currently functioning, across the Gaza Strip. Two SCs are supported by WHO and Med-Global at Kamal Adwan and Patients Friends Benevolent Society Hospitals (10 beds each); one SC is supported by WHO and IMC at the IMC Deir Al-Balah FH (7 beds); and one supported by MSF-Spain at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis (6 beds).\n- The Health and WASH clusters published a joint information note on the potential public health impact of flooding on the Gazan population, during the approaching winter season. According to the 2023 flood risk assessment and current population distribution, many internally displaced people are located near flooding hotspots, increasing risks of injury and drowning. Forty-seven per cent (114/242) of health service points were found to be near flooding hotspots, putting them at risk of damage and jeopardizing the population\u2019s access to essential health services. Formation of stagnant pools also increases the risk of vector-borne diseases as they become breeding sites for mosquitoes, and contamination of water supplies with sewage increases the risk of water-borne diseases. Additional potential impact includes exacerbation of psychological stress, in addition to other effects related to exposure to mold, environmental and chemical hazards.\n- Renewed attacks on health:\n- On 21 September, an MOH warehouse in North Rafah was attacked. Deaths of four MOH employees and injuries to six were reported.\n- MOH confirmed the death of three healthcare workers who were reportedly detained while on duty between December 2023 and March 2024, increasing the number of health workers killed in detention to five, since 7 October.\n- Medical evacuation of patients outside of Gaza remains limited since 7 May. As of 25 September, out of 14,510 cases requested for medical evacuation, 5,130 (35%) have been evacuated, since October 2023, with only 219 patients evacuated since Rafah Closure in May 2024. Of utmost urgency is the restoration of medical evacuations from Gaza to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where hospitals are ready to receive patients. Patients must also be facilitated to be transferred to Egypt and Jordan, and from there to other countries when needed. WHO appeals for the establishment of multiple medical evacuation corridors to ensure sustained, organized, safe and timely passage of patients via all possible routes, including Rafah and Kerem Shalom.\n- Persistent fuel shortages continue to threaten humanitarian interventions, including health care provision, impacting the functionality of hospitals, PHCCs and ambulance services.\n- According to Israeli authorities, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed inside Israel, and approximately 5,400 reported injuries. As of 25 September, there have been 346 reported fatalities and 2,290 reported injuries of Israeli soldiers since the start of the ground operation in the Gaza Strip. One hundred and one hostages remain in Gaza.",

        "content": "title: Javier Bardem on Gaza: \u2018We cannot remain indifferent while Israel commits war crimes\u2019 \n content: The famous Spanish actor and Oscar winner Javier Bardem spoke about the Israeli genocidal war against the Gaza Strip when accepting an award at the San Sebastian Film Festival last week, calling for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages held by Hamas and for occupation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be put on trial.\nIn his acceptance speech, Bardem expressed: \u201cI receive it with deep gratitude and great joy, but I don\u2019t have a celebratory spirit. It is impossible for me, with the world as it is, to celebrate anything.\u201d\n\u201cI believe the Israeli government is the most radical government in Israel\u2019s history, and that its committing crimes against humanity, that its committing crimes under international law, investigated by the International Criminal Court, and that obviously, the atrocious, terrible, and condemnable brutal attacks by Hamas on October 7 do not justify the total punishment the massive punishment that the Palestinian population is enduring,\u201d he continued.\nHe stressed the need: \u201cFor different mediators to come into play because the Netanyahu government and the leaders of Hamas will never reach an agreement.\u201d\nOPINION: In Netanyahu\u2019s warped mind, committing war crimes is Israel\u2019s right\nBardem criticised Israel\u2019s allies, exclaiming: \u201cI believe countries like the US, Germany, the UK, especially, need to rethink their logic of behaviour and unconditional support when we are witnessing crimes against human rights, crimes under international law. We cannot remain indifferent to that.\u201d\n\u201cWe are all a society, we are all one world, and we are all victims of what\u2019s happening, perhaps at a secondary or tertiary level, but victims nonetheless,\u201d he said, noting: \u201cI think society is beginning to understand that the legitimate right to criticise any government or state has nothing to do with, in this case, the false accusation of antisemitism, or, in the case of criticising Hamas, being accused of Islamophobia.\u201d\nOn the sidelines of the festival, Bardem said: \u201cI believe that we can and must help bring peace. If we take a different approach, then we will get different results. The security and prosperity of Israel and the health and future of a free Palestine will only be possible through a culture of peace, coexistence and respect,\u201d Bardem told AP.\n\u201cTo continue to stall negotiations and return to the previous status quo, as they say, or as we are seeing now, embark on a race to further violations of international law would be to perpetuate the war and eventually lead us off a cliff,\u201d Bardem noted, adding: \u201cThat while antisemitism and Islamophobia are real and serious problems in the US, Europe and beyond, that the terms are being used to divert attention away from the legitimate right to criticise the actions of the Israeli government and of Hamas.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing crimes against human rights, crimes under international law, such as, for example, the banning of food, water, medicines, electricity, using, as UNICEF says, war against children and the trauma that\u2019s being created for generations.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother educated me on the importance of treating all human beings equally, regardless of skin colour, ethnicity, religion, nationality, socio and economic status, ability or sexuality. Actions inform us and that alone interests me about people. That\u2019s why I have always been concerned about discrimination of any kind. That includes antisemitism and Islamophobia,\u201d voiced Bardem.\nFamous actor Mark Ruffalo praised Bardem\u2019s comments, posting on X: \u201cThank you Javier Bardem for your decency, your courage, and love for all human beings.

More than 6,000 women and 11,000 children have been killed in Gaza over the past 12 months, prompting urgent demands for an immediate and permanent ceasefire as violence escalates in Lebanon and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.\nOxfam\u2019s Middle East and North Africa Director, Sally Abi Khalil, described the situation as \u201cboth appalling and heartbreaking,\u201d criticising the international community for failing to hold Israel accountable.\n\u201cThese staggering figures are both appalling and heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cInfluential actors in the international community have not only failed to hold Israel to account, they are also complicit in the atrocities by continuing to unconditionally supply it with arms. It will take generations to recover from the devastating impacts of this war and there is still no ceasefire in sight.\u201d\nOther sources put the number of women and children killed by Israel much higher. In August, for example, Al Jazeera reported that \u201cmore than 40,000\u201d Palestinians had been killed, \u201cat least 16,456 of them children and over 11,000 women.\u201d\nThe Oxfam report also highlighted data from the group Every Casualty Counts, which shows that Gaza has seen over five times more child deaths this past year than between 2005 and 2022 combined.\nAlongside the devastating loss of life, the destruction of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure has been catastrophic. Over 68 per cent of cropland and vital roads have been either destroyed or severely damaged. Only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially operational, all of which face critical shortages of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water. Palestinian civilians have been forcibly displaced multiple times, moving between \u201csafe zones\u201d that often fail to meet basic humanitarian needs and are frequently targeted by Israeli attacks.\nMoreover, Action on Armed Violence reports that Israeli forces have hit civilian infrastructure with explosive weapons every three hours since the conflict began, resulting in widespread destruction.\nThe report also notes that more than 25,000 children have been left orphaned or have lost at least one parent, leaving many to deal with severe physical injuries, anxiety and trauma. Dr Umaiyeh Khammash, director of Oxfam partner Juzoor, described the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe as \u201cdevastating,\u201d with thousands of people now seeking shelter in over 90 health points and shelters across Gaza.\n\u201cThe past year has had a devastating impact with women bearing a double burden,\u201d explained Dr Khammash. \u201cMany have suddenly become the heads of their households, navigating survival and care in the midst of destruction. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers have faced immense difficulties, including from the collapse in healthcare services.\u201d\nShe added that for children, the trauma is equally profound. \u201cOver 25,000 children have either lost a parent or become orphans, leaving them in deep emotional distress. Most children are grappling with anxiety and severe physical injuries, with many having lost limbs.\u201d\nOxfam is calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and an end to arms sales to Israel. The report also demands full humanitarian access to Gaza and urges the international community to enforce accountability by addressing the illegal Israeli occupation, removing settlements in the occupied West Bank, and providing reparations to affected Palestinian communities.\nREAD: Al Jazeera investigation exposes Israeli \u2018war crimes\u2019 in Gaza",

Jabalia refugee camp is surrounded, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said at the weekend, before issuing evacuation orders on Tuesday.\nStrikes have also been reported in Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, towns in the northeast of Gaza, with roads also closed.\n\"Intensified military operations in the north are forcing us to shut down lifesaving services,\" Mr. Lazzarini said on social media on Wednesday.\nHe added that seven of the UN agency's schools-turned-shelters are being evacuated, while only two out of eight water wells in Jabalia camp are still operational. Some 400,000 people are believed to remain in the north of Gaza.\n\"Children are, as ever, the first and most to suffer,\" the UNRWA chief said, adding that hunger was \"spreading and deepening again\" because \"almost no basic supplies\" were available.\nAccording to local health authorities in Gaza, at least 45 people were killed and 130 wounded in the last 24 hours. Since Hamas-led terror attacks in multiple Israeli sites that left some 1,250 dead and more than 250 taken hostage, the death toll in Gaza has reportedly reached at least 42,000 people. Another 97,700 have been wounded, often with life-changing injuries.\nDevastation in Lebanon\nIn Lebanon, meanwhile, the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, reported \"relentless\" and \"amplifying\" bombardment\" into previously unaffected areas, amid ongoing missile strikes on Israel by Hezbollah.\n\"In a single day - 6 October - more than 30 airstrikes struck the Beirut southern suburbs and surrounding areas, frightening residents and forcing additional displacement from densely populated areas, including Shatila Palestine refugee camp,\" OCHA said in an update published Wednesday.\nLatest data from the health ministry indicate more than 2,083 collective deaths and 9,869 injuries since 8 October 2023, when Hezbollah rocket fire increased into northern Israel as the war in Gaza erupted. Most casualties in Lebanon have happened in the last two weeks, amid intense Israeli bombardment and ground operations in southern Lebanon.\nAccording to the UN human rights office, OHCHR, 25 per cent of Lebanese territory is affected by Israeli military displacement orders. Displacement orders are issued \"on a daily basis\" for more than 100 villages and urban neighbourhoods across southern Lebanon, forcing people to flee and pushing many up to 30 km north.\nMassive displacement\nOCHA reported that in total, some 1.2 million people are now internally displaced, with 180,700 people seeking refuge in 978 shelters, 775 of which are already at full capacity. The violence has also delayed the start of the school year, while the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, said that about 350,000 children have been displaced.\n\"Extensive civilian harm is occurring due to explosive weapons in densely populated areas and forced displacement orders,\" OCHA noted. \"Urgent action is necessary to shield civilians from escalating violence and ensure that humanitarian and aid workers can safely deliver critical support.\"\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

It was the deadliest strike in the West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago.\nOn Friday, paramedics searched the rubble inside the blasted-out coffee shop, gathering human remains into small boxes. Young boys and men walked among the ruins of the shop, with holes in the ceiling and debris blanketing the ground, digging past bloodstained furniture and dislodged iron beams for anything to salvage.\nAmong the dead was the Abu Zahra family: Muhammad, a bakery worker; his wife, Saja; and their two children, Sham, 8, and Karam, 6, according to the man's brother, Mustafa Abu Zahra, who said the family lived above the coffee shop. He added that one of Muhammad's brothers-in-law was also in the apartment at the time and was killed.\nThe Israeli military said the strike killed several militants, including Hamas' leader in the camp, who it accused of planning and taking part in multiple attacks against Israeli civilians. Tulkarem, known to be a hotbed of Palestinian militancy, is a flashpoint in the West Bank and a frequent target of Israeli military raids.\nHamas, which did not immediately claim any of the dead as its fighters, condemned the strike and called for Palestinians in Tulkarem to rise up.\nIsrael has carried out several large-scale raids in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. While airstrikes used to be rare in the Palestinian territory, they have grown more common since the outbreak of war as Israeli forces clamp down, saying they aim to prevent attacks on their citizens.\nIsraeli fire has killed at least 722 Palestinians in the West Bank since Oct. 7, Palestinian health officials say. In that time, Palestinian militants have launched a number of attacks on soldiers at checkpoints and within Israel.\nA shooting attack in Tel Aviv earlier this week that Israeli police said was carried out by Palestinians from the West Bank left at least six people dead.\nNimer Fayat, the owner of Dr. Coffee, said the cafe was full with \"regular customers coming to eat and drink\" when the strike occurred around 10:15 p.m.\n\"What happened was a very strong blow, the likes of which we had not seen in the past since the Al-Aqsa Intifada,\" he said, using a Palestinian term for the second intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s.\nParamedics rushing to the area encountered a ghastly scene, with body parts flung onto power lines by the force of the blast, said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, whose teams brought nine dead to the hospital.\nA full list of the dead and wounded was not immediately released by the Palestinian Health Ministry.\nYasser Jibra, another relative of the Abu Zahras, said the strike was \"like a lightning bolt.\"\n\"Look around, the destruction is so obvious,\" he said, adding that it was difficult to identify the bodies of his loved ones.\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on civilian deaths in the strike. Israel says it takes care to guard against such deaths.\nBut to Jibra, that means little.\n\"This is the work of the criminal occupation, which does not take into account the presence of a child or a woman, or an elderly or young person,\" he said, as he stood inside the blasted-out cafe. \"Everything is permissible for them.\"",

During that period, the Israeli military said Hamas was trying to \u201creassemble\u201d in the area, raising doubts about whether Israel\u2019s goal of eradicating the group in the enclave is realistic.\nIn the separate incident in southern Gaza, a mosque was targeted by Israeli forces early Sunday, killing at least 21 people, while another strike on a school killed four people, hospital officials said,\nCNN video showed chaotic scenes as bodies were pulled from rubble after the overnight attack on the religious site in Deir el Balah, where Palestinians were sheltering.\n\u201cThe mosque was a shelter for displaced people, there are no militants or anything inside,\u201d said Nabil Nadda, who was nearby when the strike happened. \u201cJust people who have no shelter, tents, or homes so they sheltered in the mosque.\u201d\nThe Israeli military confirmed it carrying out strikes on both sites, calling them \u201cprecise\u201d and said were targeting Hamas \u201ccommand and control\u201d centers.\nThe renewed fighting comes on the eve of the anniversary of the October 7 attacks, which saw Hamas kill around 1,200 people in Israel and seize more than 250 hostages.\nThe Israeli offensive that followed in Gaza \u2013 which Israel says is aimed at destroying Hamas \u2013 has killed more than 41,000 people and triggered a humanitarian crisis.",

        "content": "title: Gaza is one of the most dangerous places in the world to learn and teach - over 400 teachers have died in the war \n content: On 5 October, World Teachers\u2019 Day, our thoughts turn to Gaza, where children and young people living in the midst of war have been deprived of formal education for almost a year. FCA\u2019s new work in Gaza focuses on education and psychosocial support in a difficult humanitarian situation\nGAZA is currently one of the most dangerous places in the world for learning and teaching.\n\u201cThe situation in schools in Gaza is catastrophic and children are severely traumatised. They have not been able to go to school for a whole year, which is particularly important for children in crisis. Schools and professional teachers offer children a routine and a chance to forget about the war, if only for a moment,\u201d says Sabina Bergholm , FCA Country Director.\nWorld Teachers\u2019 Day is celebrated on 5 October to remind people of the importance of the work that teachers do and the importance of investing in their training and working conditions.\nIn Gaza, teachers do not have the opportunity to work in a safe environment.\nOver 10,000 school children and more than 400 teachers and other education professionals have been killed in the Gaza war this year. In addition, more than 16,000 students and 2,400 teachers have been wounded, according to data from the Ministry of Education in Gaza, available via the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) as of 2 October 2024.\nAround 625,000 schoolchildren and students in Gaza have no access to formal education. 87% of school buildings have either been destroyed or severely damaged.\nIn September 2024 alone, 17 air strikes hit Gaza schools. According to OCHA data, 14 schools were occupied by refugees at the time of the attacks. Attacking schools is a violation of international humanitarian law.\n\u201cSchools should never be the target of bombing. During the war in Gaza, schools have also been used as shelters for refugees. Attacks on schools have killed and injured a huge number of civilians. When the war ends, it will also be difficult to resume teaching in schools, because either there are no schools or they have been damaged in the war,\u201d said Bergholm.\nFCA starts education and psychosocial support work in Gaza\nEducation in emergencies is at the core of FCA\u2019s work. In the midst of crises and disasters, schooling offers children both the opportunity to continue learning and a sense of security and routine.\nAs part of its new regional humanitarian assistance operation, FCA has recently launched a programme to increase access to schooling and psychosocial support in Gaza.\nWorking with partner organisations, the programme will focus on reaching out to traumatised and war-affected children, teachers, and other adults around them.\n\u201cA temporary school will be set up in Gaza City to provide a range of after-school activities, support and additional education. Gazan teachers will be involved and will be offered psychosocial support and the opportunity to participate in training on teaching in crisis situations,\u201d said Bergholm.\nThe project is also significant because students who have been caught up in the war have been without formal education for almost a year. Only a small number of children and young people in Gaza have been able to participate in non-formal school activities during the year.\n\u201cTeachers are both facilitators of learning for children and important adults who provide security and support during difficult times in their lives. This is why FCA is investing in supporting and further training teachers in the midst of the crisis. We have seen the positive impact that a competent teacher can have on their students,\u201d says Bergholm.\nThe war in Gaza has also complicated the situation in the occupied West Bank, where FCA\u2019s volunteer network Teachers Without Borders has continued to support teachers over the past year.\nFurther information and interview requests:\nCountry Director Sabina Bergholm, +358 40 669 3930, sabina.bergholm@kua.fi",

        "content": "title: ACAPS Briefing Note: Palestine - One year of hostilities: impact on education in Gaza (04 October 2024) \n content: OVERVIEW\nOne year after the Israel\u2013Gaza conflict began, Gaza continues to face devastating effects, with unprecedented loss of life and widespread infrastructure destruction. By 24 September, the hostilities had killed more than 41,495 people and injured 96,006 in Gaza, and an estimated 1.9 million people have been internally displaced (90% of the population) (OCHA 25/09/2024). As of 9 September, around 86% of Gaza remained under Israeli-issued evacuation orders.\nThe impact of the hostilities has disproportionately affected civilians, especially children.\nAs millions of students around the world start a new academic year, students in Gaza are still grappling with the conflict\u2019s impacts, including severe disruptions to their education (AJ 04/09/2024; EAA 13/03/2024). Since 7 October 2023, all schools, universities, and training centres in Gaza have remained closed, and displacement, facility destruction, and access constraints from Israeli military operations have left Gazans without education access (Al Mezan 02/09/2024).\n\u2022 Fatalities by 24 September 2024 included at least 10,310 students and 410 school teachers (OCHA 25/09/2024).\n\u2022 Injuries by 24 September included over 19,110 students and 2,460 school teachers (OCHA 25/09/2024).\n\u2022 The hostilities had displaced at least 19,000 students within Gaza by 9 September (MoE X 09/09/2024).\n\u2022 Fatalities by 26 September included more than 650 university students and 110 educators (TNH 26/09/2024).\n\u2022 The figures of deaths, injuries, and displacement are likely much higher than reported, as insecurity and access constraints, including infrastructure destruction, challenge data collection and reporting mechanisms.\n\u2022 More than 625,000 school-age children in Gaza have gone a full year without formal education (Reuters 21/08/2024).\n\u2022 An estimated 58,000 children were unable to start first grade for the 2024 academic year (UNICEF 09/09/2024; MoE X 09/09/2024).\n\u2022 By May, all 12 of Gaza\u2019s higher education institutions had been destroyed or damaged, grinding all services to a halt and affecting 90,000 higher education students (Reuters 13/05/2024).\n\u2022 An August UNICEF report estimated that almost all Gazan children (more than one million) needed mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) (UNICEF 08/08/2024).\n\u2022 An estimated 17,000 children were unaccompanied or separated by February, and 4,000 children were missing or buried under rubble by June (UNICEF 02/02/2024; STC 24/06/2024).\nHostilities and data collection challenges mean that these numbers were likely higher by September 2024.\nInternational humanitarian law grants schools general protection against direct attacks, and attacks on schools are one of six grave violations against children in armed conflict contexts as identified by the UNSC (ECW 02/04/2024; SRSG/CAAC accessed 24/09/2024). By 30 March, however, attacks had directly hit or damaged at least 88% of school buildings (477 out of 564) since 7 October 2023 (OCHA 25/09/2024; ECW 02/04/2024; Education Cluster 12/09/2024 and 28/07/2024; UNICEF accessed 24/09/2024). These numbers are based on confirmed damages, which means the figure could be as high as 93% if including likely damaged schools (Education Cluster et al. 10/09/2024).\nBetween November 2023 and July 2024, direct attacks by Israeli armed forces against schools \u2013 60% of which are serving as displacement shelters \u2013 have trended upward, with 378 directly hit by September 2024 (UNICEF accessed 24/09/2024; Education Cluster 01/10/2024). Direct attacks on schools have continued, with ten schools hit from 1\u201323 September (OHCHR 23/09/2024; AJ 21/09/2024). Many schools that were classified as \u201cdamaged\u201d in the July analysis from the Education Cluster had been struck again and were classified as \u201cdirect hit\u201d by September 2024 (Education Cluster 01/10/2024). The UN, along with independent experts, have accused Israel of the \u201csystematic obliteration\u201d of the Palestinian education system (UN 18/04/2024).",

There is mounting evidence that no Palestinian is safe under Israel\u2019s unfettered control,\u201d Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, said in a statement.\nShe noted that \u201csystematic aerial and ground attacks\u201d in the areas of Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarem and Tubas \u2014 and in refugee camps in particular \u2014 had intensified over the past few months.\nIsrael, Albanese said, \u201cis targeting Gaza and the West Bank simultaneously, as part of an overall process of elimination, replacement and territorial expansion\u201d.\nMore than 41,700 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip since October.\nIsrael in recent weeks also launched aerial and ground attacks in Lebanon as a year of cross-border firings between Israeli forces and the Lebanese group Hezbollah escalated last month.\nHundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by Israel\u2019s continued bombardment of the country, while thousands have been killed and injured.",

        "content": "title: As conflict in the Middle East widens, the IRC urges an immediate and lasting ceasefire to allow a devastated Gaza the essential aid and services needed - occupied Palestinian territory | ReliefWeb \n content: Amman, Jordan, October 3, 2024 \u2014 Nearly one year has passed since the beginning of the latest escalation of conflict in Gaza. Israeli forces launched deadly airstrikes and ground operations after Hamas and other armed groups attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 200 hostages. Now, the conflict seems likely to escalate into a wider regional war.\nThe humanitarian situation for Palestinian civilians in Gaza is untenable. According to the UN, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel\u2019s ground and air operations. However, these figures do not factor in those who remain unaccounted for, or who have died of diseases and pre-existing health conditions due to the decimation of the health system. A further 95,000 people have been injured, and a quarter will require lifelong care, following amputations and spinal injuries.\nAll of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.1 million is now in need of humanitarian assistance, and more than two million Palestinians - half of them children - are living without access to sufficient water, food, shelter and medical care. This has been compounded by the destruction of 60% of Gaza\u2019s structures due to fighting and bombardment, including civilian infrastructure such as schools, religious buildings, hospitals and bakeries.\nAmidst these dire conditions, humanitarian organizations, including the IRC and our partners, have been working to deliver humanitarian relief to Palestinians in Gaza. However, increasing restrictions on the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid, including destruction of infrastructure, bureaucratic impediments, Israeli attacks on aid convoys and killings of aid workers, mean that many Palestinians in Gaza are not getting the aid they need to survive.\nAs the only way to protect Palestinian lives, and enable the release of the remaining hostages, the IRC continues to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire. In the meantime, the IRC is calling on all parties with influence to put in place a \u201chumanitarian reset\u201d that will allow for an immediate and significant scale up of humanitarian aid to those in need.\nThe only way to fully address the humanitarian access challenges in Gaza is a ceasefire paired with a comprehensive \u201chumanitarian reset\u201d that includes immediate action to:\n- Open all land border crossings to goods and personnel\n- Streamline inspection processes and list of permitted supplies\n- Facilitate eased entry of humanitarian and healthcare staff\n- Ensure safe movement for all humanitarian and healthcare workers\n- Fully reinstate critical services like water, power, and fuel supplies\nNotes to Editors\nIn Gaza, the IRC has deployed 12 teams of emergency medical personnel (EMTs) on a rotational basis; launched a Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition program and delivered 1,700 cartons of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food to northern Gaza. We are distributing 100,000 liters of clean drinking water per day; have trained caregivers on Psychosocial Support, provided men, women and children with protection services and connected caregivers with the Ahlan Family Corner social media campaign, which provides tips and coping strategies.

        "content": "title: White House warned of risk of Israeli war crimes days after Oct 7: Report \n content: White House warned of risk of Israeli war crimes days after Oct 7: Report\nA Reuters investigation found that the Biden administration was warned on three occasions about possible Israeli crimes in Gaza.\nSenior Pentagon and Department of State officials warned US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration of potential Israeli war crimes days after the start of the October 7, 2023, war on Gaza, an investigation by the Reuters news agency finds.\nReuters reported on Friday that after reviewing three sets of email exchanges between senior US administration officials, dated between October 11 and 14, officials had sounded the alarm that a rising death toll in Gaza could violate international law and affect US ties to the Arab world.\n\u201cThe messages also show internal pressure in the Biden administration to shift its messaging from showing solidarity with Israel to including sympathy for Palestinians and the need to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza,\u201d the investigation found.\nIn an email sent on October 11 \u2013 five days after Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel and the start of the offensive in Gaza \u2013 the US State Department\u2019s top public diplomacy official, Bill Russo, told senior officials that the US was \u201closing credibility among Arabic-speaking audiences\u201d by not addressing the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nOn that day, Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry had recorded a death toll of about 1,200 Palestinians.\n\u201cThe US\u2019s lack of response on the humanitarian conditions for Palestinians is not only ineffective and counterproductive, but we are also being accused of being complicit to potential war crimes by remaining silent on Israel\u2019s actions against civilians,\u201d Russo wrote.\nRusso urged Biden\u2019s administration to take swift action and change its public stance from its unwavering support of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 attack and its subsequent war on Gaza.\nHe later resigned from office in March, citing personal reasons.\nEvacuation leaflets\nTwo days later, on October 13, Israel dropped leaflets in northern Gaza, warning one million residents to leave their homes in 24 hours as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared he was going to \u201cannihilate Hamas\u201d.\nFollowing a private phone call with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the then deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, Dana Stroul, wrote in an email that day to senior aides to Biden that the humanitarian organisation was \u201craising private alarm that Israel is close to committing war crimes\u201d.\n\u201cTheir [ICRC\u2019s] main line is that it is impossible for one million civilians to move this fast,\u201d Stroul wrote.\nThe Reuters report added that a US official on the email chain also said it would be \u201cimpossible to carry out such an evacuation without creating a \u2018humanitarian catastrophe'\u201d.\nOther officials chimed in on the warning, calling on the administration to convince Israel to slow down on displacing civilians to southern Gaza, the report added.\nIt was on that same day that the administration, for the first time, acknowledged the suffering of Palestinians during a news conference with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Doha, Qatar.\nUS weapons\nReuters found that on October 14, Israel\u2019s senior defence adviser emailed his US State Department counterpart to request that a rifle shipment be expedited.\nChristopher Le Mon, deputy assistant secretary at the State Department\u2019s Democracy, Labour and Human Rights (DRL) bureau, which reviews potential weapons sales, recommended denying arms to Israel, citing the \u201cconduct\u201d of the Israeli National Police units, including the Yamam border patrol unit.\nLe Mon said in a letter that there were \u201cnumerous reports\u201d of Yamam\u2019s involvement in \u201cgross violations of human rights\u201d.\nSince the war began, the US has sent Israel a large number of munitions, including thousands of precision-guided missiles and 2,000-pound (900kg) bombs, Reuters added, citing several US officials.\nNearly a year into Israel\u2019s relentless war on Gaza, the Health Ministry said on Friday that at least 41,802 Palestinians have been killed and 96,844 wounded.",

I used to think the future would be bright but now I do not think so: our future is very dark.\u201d\nIn May 2024, we published these words from an 8-year-old girl in Gaza. Yomna described how her life had become \u201clike a nightmare\u201d since the previous October.\nNow, life has only gotten more challenging for Yomna and the more than 2 million others living under bombardment in Gaza. A future which seemed bleak 5 months ago, has gotten even darker as Palestinian families reflect on a year of horror, with still no end in sight.\nIt\u2019s difficult to describe the loss, destruction and devastation the Israeli bombardment is having on Gaza. The numbers are overwhelming.\nMore than 41,500 people have been killed \u2013 including over 11,400 women and 16,850 children. At least 96,000 more people have been injured.\nOnly 17 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are still functional \u2013 and all only partially. Shortages of fuel, medicine and essential supplies are hampering efforts to treat the wounded and care for the chronically ill.\nAround 90% of Gaza\u2019s population is now displaced, with many having to flee again and again in search of safety, but there is nowhere safe for them to go. Diseases are spreading in overcrowded shelters and famine conditions are spreading\nMany have no home to return to as bombing has left more than 60% of Gaza\u2019s residential buildings damaged or destroyed.\nSupporting the people of Gaza\nIn a new report, Islamic Relief outlines how our dedicated staff and partners in Gaza have been supporting people in desperate need over the last year, even as they face great hardship themselves.\nWith the exception of our Orphan Sponsorship Programme, which has expanded considerably, Islamic Relief\u2019s regular programmes have been suspended for the safety of our staff, partners and the communities we serve. Instead, we have focused on responding to the emergency.\nOver the last year, we have helped feed people displaced people in shelters with hot meals, food packs, vegetables and vouchers. We have also distributed desperately needed clean water and nutritional supplements to people in shelters. To help combat the spread of disease, we\u2019ve set up portable toilets and provided hygiene kits to displaced people.\nWe have organised games and performances for children to help support their mental health and provide a momentary distraction from the hardship they\u2019re enduring.\nPrior to October, Islamic Relief supported 8,750 orphans in Gaza through our Orphan Sponsorship Programme. Now, more than 16,400 children are receiving a monthly stipend, as well as food parcels and gifts at Ramadan and Eid. While the programme has expanded, we are heartbroken that 118 of the children and young people we have cared for have been killed since the crisis began.\nCeasefire now\nThe generous support of our donors is putting aid into the hands of families in desperate need in Gaza. But so much more is needed. Humanitarian organisations can ease the suffering of Palestinian families, but we cannot bring it to an end \u2013and, devastatingly, world leaders have repeatedly failed to act as international law is violated every single day.\nThe dire conditions inside Gaza are a stain on the conscience of the world, which has watched on as children are bombed, families are displaced repeatedly, women give birth without medical care, and hope is stripped from ordinary people.\nNow, after almost one year of unfathomable loss, and as Israel\u2019s bombing spreads across the region, Islamic Relief is clearer than ever that this nightmare must end. We continue to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the region. International law must be upheld, and anyone found to have committed violations must be held to account. We are calling for Israel to end its attacks and the forced displacement of civilians, and to end the siege so that sufficient humanitarian aid can enter Gaza to alleviate the suffering of its people.\nRead more in our new report A year of massacre and misery: Israel\u2019s nightmare campaign against Palestinian families in Gaza.",

Bakeries are already closing, with workers displaced along with their families,\" he told journalists at the regular briefing in New York.\n\"No fuel or commercial goods are allowed in, and aid workers are only able to bring in a trickle of humanitarian aid through Israeli checkpoints in parts of the north.\"\nSouthern Gaza completely overwhelmed\nPeople fleeing northern Gaza have limited options, as southern Gaza is already overcrowded, polluted, and totally lacking in basic services.\n\"Southern Gaza is completely overwhelmed and cannot accommodate more people,\" Mr. Dujarric said.\nAs of Monday morning, more than 50,000 Palestinians, including women and children, have been displaced within northern Gaza, with some patients evacuating hospitals in the affected areas.\n\"Many others in the north, especially in the Jabalya camp, are trapped in their homes, unable to leave safely. So far, few families have crossed Wadi Gaza heading South,\" he added.\nMr. Dujarric noted that UN agencies, alongside humanitarian partners, are closely monitoring the movement of people and providing displaced families with essential assistance where possible.\nHowever, OCHA emphasizes that evacuation orders do nothing for civilians if they have no safe place to go or lack access to shelter, food, medicine, or water, he said.\nAid workers are also forced to rely on a single, unsafe road allocated by Israeli authorities for bringing in supplies from the Kerem Shalom crossing, while facing hostilities and violent, armed looting, fuelled by the collapse of public order and safety, he added.\nSituation in Lebanon\nMeanwhile, in Lebanon, health services have been severely impacted since tensions escalated following the 7 October attacks last year by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on communities in southern Israel.\nBetween 8 October 2023 and 4 October 2024, at least 96 primary health care centres and three hospitals have been forced to close due to hostilities, with at least 77 health workers reported killed while on duty.\n\"Our health partners are supporting the Lebanese health authorities and delivering additional trauma and emergency kits to hospitals. They are also providing medicines,\" Mr. Dujarric told journalists at the same briefing.\nWater infrastructure has also been affected, with at least 25 water facilities damaged, impacting 300,000 people.\n\"We and our partners are providing hundreds of thousands of litres of drinking water to people in collective shelters,\" he added.\nDisplacement continues\nHe also noted that displacement orders continue, particularly from the south of Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut, the capital.\nAccording to the UN International Organization for Migration, more than 540,000 people have been displaced since 8 October last year.\nIn response, UN agencies and partners continue to assist people in need, having delivered over 500,000 hot meals since 23 September, as well as other critical supplies.\n\"We and our partners, in close collaboration with the Government of Lebanon, continue to lead and coordinate relief efforts for displaced and affected people,\" Mr. Dujarric said.\nHe also highlighted the Flash Appeal launched last week, aiming to provide one million people with lifesaving supplies and protection. However, as of Monday, the appeal is only 12 per cent funded, having received just $53 million.\n\"We urge donors to give. Give in cash and give quickly.\"\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

        "content": "title: Israeli army's intention to deliberately kill civilians and non-combatants and prevent aid and relief to them, disregarding international law \n content: Beirut - The Israeli army has provided no supporting documentation for its assertion that fighters are transporting combat equipment in ambulances in Lebanon -- a mere pretext for Israel\u2019s flagrant violations against the Lebanese relief and ambulance sector.\nIsraeli attacks on civilian targets, including the war crime of targeting health facilities protected by international humanitarian law, are also crimes against humanity as part of Israel's aggression against Lebanon by means of a systematic and widespread attack against Lebanese civilians.\nAccording to the toll released by the Lebanese Ministry of Health, since the start of Israeli attacks on 8 October 2023, and up until 3 October 2024, Israel has targeted 45 medical centres, 128 ambulances, and fire engines. This resulted in the deaths of 97 paramedics and the wounding of 188 others.\nIsrael also targeted 17 centres and 62 vehicles belonging to the Islamic Health Authority in Lebanon, killing 68 paramedics and wounding 98.\nFurthermore, 18 paramedics were killed and 62 injured when 57 Islamic Message Scout vehicles and 15 medical facilities were targeted.\nThe Lebanese Ambulance Authority also lost seven paramedics when a medical facility and two of its cars were attacked. Three volunteers were injured when the Israeli army attacked three medical facilities run by the International Amel Association and a Lebanese Red Cross vehicle. As for the Lebanese Civil Defense, 9 medical centres and 6 vehicles were targeted. 4 paramedics were killed, and 25 others were injured during the attacks.\nIn related Israeli actions, on Thursday, 3 October 2024, the Lebanese Civil Defence received an Israeli threat ordering its members not to travel to the targeted areas, namely the southern suburb of Beirut, which had been subjected to the most violent raids since the attacks on Lebanon expanded on 23 September 2024. The threat also stated that they would be targeted if they went near the raid sites in the suburb to aid the victims.\nThis occurred after calls were made to Civil Defence centres across Lebanon on 26 September 2024, requesting the evacuation of centres that were under threat in order to incite panic and disrupt relief efforts.\nBased on information from the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 1,974 people were killed in Lebanon between 8 October 2023, and 3 October 2024, including 127 children, 261 women, and 97 paramedics, with 9,384 injured. Israeli bombings have damaged over ten hospitals. The most recent attack occurred at Bint Jbeil Hospital on Friday evening, 4 October 2024, and UNIFIL ambulance crews were not allowed to enter to rescue casualties.\nThe Israeli army's actions, along with their targeting of the relief and health sectors, are a clear breach of international humanitarian law, which states unequivocally that medical personnel, both military and civilian, must always be respected and protected.\nAccording to Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and Article 85, paragraph 5, of the First Additional Protocol of 1977, intentional attacks against healthcare workers and relief workers are considered war crimes.\nIsrael is still bound by the Geneva Conventions and customary international humanitarian law, despite not having ratified the First Additional Protocol or the Rome Statute and not considering itself bound by them. These legal obligations go hand in hand with Israel's humanitarian and moral commitment to respect and protect paramedics and relief workers who transport and evacuate the wounded from areas of military operations and to ensure the freedom of passage for all medical missions.\nThe attacks in Lebanon bear witness to the Israeli army's intention to deliberately kill civilians and non-combatants and prevent aid and relief to them, disregarding international law and the urgent priority to always distinguish between civilians and combatants.\nThe international community must take immediate action to compel Israel to stop its crimes against relief workers in Lebanon and ensure their protection. The international community must stop these illegal attacks, prevent further escalation in the region, impose effective sanctions on Israel, and hold it accountable for its ongoing crimes against civilians and the defenseless.",

In this regard, affected students and staff should also be provided effective and full remedies.\nFinally, academic institutions must ensure that their regulations are in line with international standards.\nShaping the future\nThe rights expert stressed that universities and other educational institutions have an important \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to learn from the experiences of the university-based pro-Palestine solidarity movement and repair the harm.\n\u201cThey must recognise that their responsibility extends beyond campus borders \u2013 their actions have the potential to shape political discourse, culture, civic education, and ultimately, the future sustainability of democracy, freedoms and human rights,\u201d she said.\n\u201cRespecting and guaranteeing dissent is essential to ensure the universities remain spaces for free thought, speech and academic freedom, as well to guarantee freedom of expression, assembly and association.\u201d\nAbout UN Rapporteurs\nSpecial Rapporteurs and other independent experts are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council to monitor and report on specific country situations or thematic issues.\nThey are not UN staff, receive no payment for their work, and do not represent any government or organization.",

        "content": "title: Gaza: Geospatial data shows intensifying damage to cropland \n content: New FAO and UNOSAT assessment highlights the impact of conflict on Gaza\u2019s agricultural infrastructure\nRome \u2013 The latest assessment using satellite data produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) shows escalating damage to farmland and agricultural infrastructure in the Gaza Strip, further exacerbating the humanitarian and hunger crisis resulting from the ongoing conflict.\nAs of 1 September 2024, 67.6 percent of Gaza\u2019s cropland \u2013 or 10 183 hectares (ha) \u2013 has been damaged. This is up from 57.3 percent (8 660 ha) in May and 42.6 percent (6 694 ha) in February 2024. More specifically, 71.2 percent of orchards and other trees, 67.1 percent of field crops, and 58.5 percent of vegetables have been damaged.\nThe satellite images indicate that heavy vehicle tracks, razing, shelling, and other conflict-related pressures have also significantly damaged Gaza\u2019s agricultural infrastructure, with a total of 1 188 agricultural wells (52.5 percent) and 577.9 ha of greenhouses (44.3 percent) damaged.\n\u201cThis satellite analysis provides critical insights to support humanitarian efforts as the conflict continues to impact Gaza's agricultural sector,\" UNITAR Executive Director Nikhil Seth said. UNOSAT is a specialized program within UNITAR, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research.\n\u201cThe extent of the damages on agricultural land in the Gaza Strip has reached unprecedented levels. This raises serious concerns about the potential for food production now and in the future, because food aid alone cannot meet the daily needs of Gaza\u2019s people. This damage to agricultural land compounds the imminent risk of famine in the whole Gaza Strip,\u201d FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol said.\nMore than 2 million Gazans are still in urgent need of food and livelihood assistance as humanitarian access remains restricted. The latest assessment, covering the period 7 October 2023 \u2013 1 September 2024, reinforces concerns about the risk of famine.\nSince the conflict started, FAO and UNOSAT have provided regular agricultural assessment updates, combining field and satellite data to evaluate various agricultural indicators, such as cropland area extent.\nAssessment details of note\n- Khan Younis has the largest area of damaged cropland (2 589 ha or 61.5 percent), while North Gaza has the highest proportion of damage per governorate (78.2 percent).\n- The Port of Gaza City has been severely damaged, with most fishing boats destroyed.\n- Rafah has seen a sharp increase (183 percent) in damaged greenhouses, rising from 44 ha in April to 124.7 ha in September 2024, accounting for 27.7 percent of its total greenhouses.\n- Almost 95 percent (about 15 000) of cattle have died, and nearly all calves have been slaughtered.\n- Around 43 percent of sheep (less than 25 000 heads) and 37 percent of goats (about 3 000 heads) remain alive.\n- Dramatic losses are reported in the poultry sector, with only 1 percent (ca. 34 000) of heads alive. Commercial poultry production has largely ceased, with most operations now limited to household-level production for self-consumption.\nFAO's emergency response\nThe conflict has removed access to critical sources of protein and nutritious foods and continues to devastate peoples\u2019 livelihoods.\nAgricultural aid is urgently needed to restore the availability of highly nutritious food, prevent the agricultural sector\u2019s total collapse, preserve remaining agricultural livelihoods, and curb acute hunger and malnutrition, especially among children. Gaza\u2019s farmers, fishers, and herders are risking their lives to continue food production. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult due to the substantial damage to infrastructures, as documented in the latest geospatial analyses.\nLike other UN and humanitarian actors, FAO has experienced logistical challenges, particularly due to the restriction at crossings, caused by the collapse of law and order that constrains the delivery of agricultural aid into Gaza. As of 29 September 2024, FAO has distributed fodder to over 4 400 livestock holders in Rafah, Khan Younis, and Deir al-Balah and veterinary kits to about 2 400 herder families.\nFAO is ready to deliver more inputs to Gazan farmers and herders once access, security and mobility conditions are fully restored.",

Residents in Jabalia have described the intensified attacks as some of the worst in months.\n\u201cDozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shook the ground and buildings. It felt like the early days of the war,\u201d Raed, 52, from Jabalia, told the Reuters news agency before his family left for Gaza City on Sunday.\nOn Sunday morning, the Israeli military said its forces had \u201csuccessfully\u201d encircled the refugee camp and were operating in the area.\nThe army said the decision was taken after intelligence indicated the \u201cpresence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalia \u2026 as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area\u201d.\nIsrael has destroyed hospitals, schools and residential areas, claiming Hamas was operating under them but providing no proof of its claims. Rights organisations say these attacks amount to war crimes.\nMeanwhile, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has said its fighters have targeted \u201ca command and control room\u201d belonging to Israeli forces who were trying to get into Jabalia refugee camp.\n\u2018Deteriorating\u2019 situation\nReporting from near the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia, journalist Moath al-Kahlout said that the situation in the north was \u201cdeteriorating\u201d, adding that an \u201centire family\u201d had been killed in the overnight attacks.\n\u201cThe Israeli army dropped leaflets on the Jabalia refugee camp ordering people to flee their homes, and this alarming development suggests that the Israeli army is preparing for further attacks. This may lead to more civilian deaths and injuries,\u201d he said.\nMilitary and security analyst Elijah Magnier says Israel\u2019s renewed ground invasion of northern Gaza was \u201cinevitable\u201d as far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claimed that Palestinian armed resistance groups had recruited \u201cmore than a thousand people\u201d.\n\u201cIsraelis have returned to Gaza several times, they\u2019ve returned to the north several times, they\u2019ve destroyed the infrastructure, the hospitals, everything,\u201d Magnier told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cThey will continue doing so unless [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu stops this war.\u201d\nEvacuation orders\nThe Israeli army has called on Palestinians in northern Gaza to flee to designated \u201csafe zones\u201d in southern and central Gaza as it begins a renewed ground offensive. But no place in Gaza is safe for Palestinians, including the so-called \u201csafe zones\u201d, campaigners say.\nBut as some Palestinians begin making the journey southwards, Gaza\u2019s Interior Ministry has called on residents to ignore Israel\u2019s evacuation orders.\n\u201cIsraeli claims about the presence of safe zones in southern Gaza are lies as Israel commits crimes and massacres in all areas of the enclave,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n\u201cWe call on citizens in northern Gaza to ignore Israeli threats.\u201d\nReporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hind Khoudary said the difference this time, compared to earlier evacuation orders, is that it is \u201cnot only blocks but whole areas\u201d.\n\u201cSome of those Palestinians who were in the north have refused to evacuate despite the attacks and also the starvation and harsh conditions the blockade has imposed on them. They still refuse to leave,\u201d Khoudary said.\nShe added that a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) was also targeted in Sunday\u2019s strikes and was killed.\nAccording to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, at least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and 97,166 others injured since the war began on October 7.",

        "content": "title: One year of unimaginable suffering since the 7 October attack [EN/AR/HE] \n content: (New York/Geneva, 7 October 2024) It has been a year of unimaginable suffering, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said today as it marked one year since Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history \u2013 a horrific event that foreshadowed the devastation brought on by the Israeli response.\nThe toll is staggering:\nAccording to Israeli sources, more than 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed, including children, and nearly 5,500 have been injured.\nScores of hostages remain in Gaza, reportedly subjected to inhuman treatment, including sexual violence, exposed to hostilities and denied access to humanitarian assistance or visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nEntire Israeli communities have been displaced, living under the constant threat of indiscriminate rocket fire.\nIn Gaza, where Palestinians have already been reeling from the impact of a 17-year-old air, sea and land blockade and repeated cycles of hostilities, Israeli military operations have resulted in a catastrophe. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 41,600 Palestinians have reportedly been killed, many of them women and children, and 96,600 injured. Thousands more are missing and believed to be trapped under the rubble.\nNearly the entire population of Gaza has been displaced, many of them multiple times, with no safe place to go.\nThousands of Palestinians are arbitrarily detained, reportedly subjected to torture and other inhuman treatment and with no information on their whereabouts.\nCivilians face extreme deprivation, with limited or no access to health care, food, electricity or humanitarian aid. Children have missed out on an entire year of education. Schools sheltering displaced families have been repeatedly shelled, health-care workers and hospitals have been systematically attacked, and aid convoys have been continually blocked and even shot at.\nIn the West Bank, the use of lethal force by Israeli forces, along with rampant settler violence and house demolitions, have led to a sharp rise in fatalities, widespread destruction and forced displacement.\n\u201cNo statistics or words can fully convey the extent of the physical, mental and societal devastation that has taken place,\u201d said Joyce Msuya, the Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. \u201cBut we know what must happen: The hostages must be released and treated humanely. Civilians must be protected and their essential needs met. Palestinians arbitrarily detained must be released. Humanitarian workers must be safeguarded and their work facilitated. Perpetrators must be held accountable for any serious violations of international humanitarian law. And the assault on Gaza must stop.\u201d\nThe past year has seen Israel blocking humanitarian access into and within Gaza, crippling aid operations. As a result, a weakened population is left to battle disease, hunger and death.\nMore than 300 aid workers, the vast majority from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), have been killed in Gaza \u2013 more than in any other single crisis, making Gaza the most dangerous place for aid workers.\nDespite the immense risks \u2013 including violence, looting of supplies, and access challenges \u2013 humanitarian agencies continue to deliver aid when and where they can. More than 560,000 children were vaccinated against polio during the first phase of an emergency vaccination campaign \u2013 an example of what can be achieved when aid workers can reach people in need. But such examples are few.\n\u201cIt has been 12 months of unrelenting tragedy \u2013 this must end,\u201d said Ms. Msuya. \u201cMember States must wield their influence to ensure respect for international humanitarian law and human rights and compliance with the rulings of the International Court of Justice. They must also work to end impunity. An immediate ceasefire and durable peace are long overdue.\u201d\nFor further information, please contact:\nIn New York, Eri Kaneko, kaneko@un.org, +1 917 208 8910\nIn Geneva, Jens Laerke, laerke@un.org, +41 79 472 9750\nAdditional resources for journalists:\nVideo from OCHA\nPhotos from OCHA\nDisclaimer\n- UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n- To learn more about OCHA's activities, please visit https://www.unocha.org/.",

        "content": "title: Collective trauma marks anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel \n content: As the conflict in Gaza enters its second year, the World Health Organization is calling for an end to the \"unspeakable suffering\" of civilians in Israel and the region and for health care to be protected and not attacked.\nThe WHO says the horrific attacks by Hamas militants and other armed groups in Israel on October 7 of last year touched off events that have caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as the displacement of millions of people in Israel, Gaza, the West Bank, and now in Lebanon.\nDr. Michel Thieren, special WHO representative to Israel, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Friday that for Israel, the October 7 massacres mark an event as significant and agonizing as the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States.\n\u201cOctober 7, 2024, marks one year of captivity for 101 hostages who, from their timeless tunnels [in Gaza] may not realize that yesterday it was their New Year celebration,\u201d he said.\nSpeaking on a video link from Tel Aviv, he noted that \u201cthis Monday will mark one year of a collective trauma that has spared no one in the country, has spread at pandemic speed and has doubled and in some parts tripled the demand for mental health care.\u201d\nMeanwhile, in Gaza, where hostilities continue to rage 12 months after Israel attacked the Palestinian enclave, the World Health Organization reports that more than 6% of the population has either been killed or injured, while at least 10,000 people remain buried under the rubble.\nSpeaking from Jerusalem, Dr. Ayadil Saparbekov, WHO lead for emergencies in the occupied Palestinian territory, said, \u201cThe health system has suffered immensely from repeated attacks and an ongoing shortage of supplies, medicines, fuel, and staff.\n\u201cSince October 2023, there have been at least 516 attacks on health care in Gaza, resulting in 765 deaths.\u201d\nThe World Health Organization reports only half of Gaza\u2019s hospitals are partially operational and 43% of primary health care centers are functional.\nIt notes many essential health services are unavailable, including Gaza's only limb reconstruction center and sole psychiatric hospital. Other critical services, such as oncology and MRI services, specialized pediatric surgery and endocrinology services also are out of commission.\n\"At least 24,090 people are suffering from life-changing injuries due to the conflict, with no access to rehabilitation or specialized care,\" Saparbekov said. \"We are deeply concerned about the conflict's impact on mental health in Gaza, where more than 485,000 people had already been diagnosed with mental disorders before the war.\"\nThe WHO flags malnutrition as another major concern. It said more than 20,000 children have been admitted for malnutrition treatment since January, including 4,437 for severe acute malnutrition, a condition that can lead to death if left untreated.\nThe U.N. health agency warns communicable diseases are a significant public health threat, with cases of acute watery diarrhea and acute respiratory infections accounting for more than 80% of diseases reported during the first eight months of 2024.\n\"The poor water, sanitation, and hygiene situation, along with overcrowding in shelters, are the primary drivers of these diseases,\" Saparbekov said. \"These conditions are expected to worsen during winter, likely leading to a further rise in cases.\"\nOn a more positive note, he mentioned that preparations are underway for the second round of a polio vaccination campaign, scheduled to begin October 14 and end October 29.\n\"We have communicated these dates to the Israeli authorities, and we are having a meeting on Sunday to see whether this will be confirmed. We estimate that over 500,000 children between the ages of zero to 10 years will be vaccinated with the novel oral polio vaccine.\n\"In addition to the polio vaccinations, the children also will receive a dose of vitamin A to boost their immune system,\" he said.\nWHO officials warn that repeated evacuation orders by Israel and ongoing hostilities continue to disrupt humanitarian operations in Gaza.\nAs the grim one-year anniversary of Hamas' terror attack on Israel nears, they are calling for \"effective deconfliction and protection of health care, safe access to health facilities, and sustained aid flow into and across Gaza\" to assist the many in desperate need.",

        "content": "title: UN condemns deadly West Bank airstrike, attacks on Gaza schools \n content: UN condemns deadly West Bank airstrike, attacks on Gaza schools\nThe UN chief has strongly condemned the killing of several Palestinians, including women and children, who died when a residential building in Tulkarem camp in the West Bank was hit by Israeli airstrikes on Thursday night.\nAt least 18 people were killed, and many more fatalities could be trapped under the rubble of the three-storied building, according to the UN human rights office (OHCHR).\nThe killings \u201cmarked yet another escalation of the violence\u201d, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General St\u00e9phane Dujarric told journalists at the regular news briefing at UN Headquarters in New York on Friday.\nUN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres also called for strict compliance with international law.\n\u201cCivilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected at times,\u201d said Mr. Dujarric.\nHe also noted the UN chief\u2019s call \u201cto urgently come together to address the escalating cycle of violence, and work towards ending the occupation and returning to a track for the two-State solution, which remains the only just and resolution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201d\n\u201cThe bloodshed that we are seeing must end.\u201d\nUN teams and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are coordinating a visit to the area to assess the damage and humanitarian needs.\nSystematic resort to lethal force\nThe UN human rights office (OHCHR) also denounced attack, describing it \u201canother clear example\u201d of Israeli Security Forces\u2019 (ISF) \u201cresort to lethal force in the West Bank that is frequently unnecessary, disproportionate, and therefore unlawful.\u201d\n\u201cThe levelling of an entire building filled with people via aerial bombing shows flagrant disregard for Israel\u2019s obligations,\u201d OHCHR said in a statement issued on Friday.\nIt called for Israel to conduct a thorough, prompt, independent and transparent investigation into the incident and hold perpetrators of violations to account.\nNo clashes or confrontations were occurring at the site, and according to information gathered by OHCHR, most of those killed were not armed or being sought by the Israeli security forces. A majority were killed in their homes or simply passing by in the street.\nIsraeli forces claimed that they had killed a local Hamas leader, who was allegedly planning to carry out attacks on Israeli settlements, as well as other alleged terrorists.\nHighly concerning pattern\nOHCHR further noted that the strike was part of \u201ca highly concerning pattern\u201d of unlawful use of force by Israeli forces during military-like operations in the West Bank that have caused widespread harm to Palestinians, as well as significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.\nSince 7 October 2023 \u2013 when Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups attacked communities in southern Israel \u2013 Israeli forces have killed 697 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 161 children and 12 women, according to OHCHR. Of those, 186 deaths were due to airstrikes.\nIn Tulkarem alone, 174 Palestinians have been killed, including 88 by airstrikes.\n\u201cSuch incidents cannot become normalized as an acceptable method of law enforcement,\u201d OHCHR stated.\nAttacks against schools in Gaza\nMeanwhile in Gaza, the UN agency assisting Palestine refugees (UNRWA) said on Friday that three of its schools had been hit over the previous two days, reportedly killing 20 people. The schools had been sheltering about 20,000 people.\nThe agency added that since the war began, more than 140 of its schools have come under attack, stressing that schools are not a target and cannot be used for any military purposes by anyone.\nAccording to UN Children Fund\u2019s (UNICEF) estimates, at least 87 per cent of school buildings in Gaza have been directly hit or damaged since October last year, including a third of UNRWA schools.\nHumanitarians must be allowed to save lives\nUN aid coordination office, OCHA, said on Wednesday they had visited the site of an attack the previous night in the Maan area, east of Khan Younis, Mr. Dujarric told journalists.\n\u201cOur colleagues report that ambulances trying to evacuate the injured could not reach them due to the ongoing incursion,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHours later, when first responders were finally able to access the area, their bulldozer ran out of fuel while recovering bodies from beneath the rubble.\u201d\nHe reiterated that emergency teams in Gaza must have the equipment, fuel and most importantly the safe and unimpeded access they need to save lives.",

        "content": "title: One year on, the world has failed civilians in Gaza, with terrifying global consequences \n content: The world\u2019s complete failure to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza over the past year is doing irreparable damage to international law, with terrifying global consequences, Islamic Relief warns as the wider Middle East region stands on the precipice of disaster.\nOver the past year we have seen international law violated every day with total impunity. Israel\u2019s indiscriminate and relentless attacks have killed and wounded civilians at a faster rate than anywhere this century. Israel continues to use starvation as a weapon of war, blocking food from reaching starving children. Families are ordered from one area to another like pawns on a chessboard, then bombed in the schools and tents where they are told to shelter. Entire neighbourhoods are now rubble, and schools, hospitals and religious sites have all come under unprecedented attack. More humanitarian workers, medics, teachers and journalists have been killed in Gaza than anywhere else. Warnings of ethnic cleansing, genocide and war crimes continue to be ignored as each day brings new horror and families are squeezed into ever-shrinking areas. Gaza\u2019s entire society is being destroyed.\nInternational Humanitarian Law (IHL), or \u2018the law of war\u2019, was established to protect civilians all over the world from the impact of conflict. If these laws are not upheld consistently and are allowed to be violated so blatantly, there is even less chance of holding warring parties to account and protecting civilians elsewhere. Millions of lives affected by conflicts all over the world are at stake.\nNow as the crisis spreads, Islamic Relief continues to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire across the region. International governments must use all their leverage to demand an end to attacks on civilians and violations of international law, including by ending all arms sales that fuel the violence. Ultimately Islamic Relief wants to see a lasting peace where all Palestinians and Israelis can live in safety and dignity, and have their same fundamental human rights upheld. We believe that this will not ultimately be possible until there is an end to the Israeli Occupation.\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is virtually unparalleled. An Islamic Relief aid worker in Gaza, whose name is withheld for his safety, says:\n\u201cThis has been a year of torture, famine, loss and annihilation. After one year I still don\u2019t see any ceasefire on the horizon and Israel blocks aid with impunity as the world watches.\n\u201cAlmost everyone is displaced. My own house is damaged and uninhabitable, my sisters and brothers have lost their homes, and all my colleagues at Islamic Relief have lost theirs.\n\u201cOur Islamic Relief office is gone, as are my children\u2019s schools, the mosque I used to pray at, the hospital where my kids were born, the restaurants I liked, and my Christian neighbours\u2019 church. Israel is systematically destroying our lives.\n\u201cWe search everywhere for medicine for my mum\u2019s diabetes but can\u2019t find it anywhere. My friend is suffering so badly from kidney stones that they can hardly move, but there is no treatment. I can\u2019t even find paracetamol and Israel blocks wounded people from leaving Gaza for treatment.\u201d\nDespite the enormous challenges, Islamic Relief staff and local partners have delivered aid almost every single day over the past year. This includes cooking and distributing more than 40 million hot meals for displaced families who have nothing else to eat, providing water to 110,000 people a day, supplying nutritional supplements to 35,000 pregnant women and young children every 2 weeks, and running psychosocial support sessions for over 94,000 children.\nBut the scale of the crisis is almost incomprehensible. One in every 16 people in Gaza are now killed or wounded, with more than 41,000 people killed and 96,000 injured. Around 1.9 million people \u2013 90% of the population \u2013 are now displaced from their homes, most of them having to move multiple times as nowhere is safe. 60% of homes and 68% of roads are damaged or destroyed, and more than half of hospitals and health facilities have been forced to shut down. 85% of schools have been bombed, hundreds of teachers killed, and 625,000 children have now been out of school for a whole year, with enormous implications for future generations. The relentless crisis is having a devastating psychological toll.\nAlmost all civilians are facing severe shortages of food, with young children at immediate risk of starvation and facing long-term impacts of malnutrition such as stunted growth and impaired cognitive development.\nThis year-long massacre must not be allowed to continue for a moment longer.",

In an interview with our correspondent in Gaza, Ziad Taleb, Mr. Kallakh said that the initiative works to provide care to families in what he described as an \u201corphanage city\u201d, including shelter, food and drink, medical care alongside educational and social services, with help, including from the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).\n\u201cWe have a dedicated medical centre and a school sponsored by the United Nations, through UNICEF, which thankfully provided the necessary resources for the school, embracing students, providing them with stationery and paying teachers\u2019 salaries,\u201d Mr. Kallakh said. \u201cWe want to establish this school completely, to replace these small tents, to create a more comfortable environment for students to receive their education.\u201d\nMore than 17,000 orphans in Gaza\nThe number of children served here is just a drop in the sea of orphaned children in Gaza who are in need of protection. The number of unprotected orphans in Gaza now ranges between 17,000 and 18,000, many of whom are unaccompanied by any family members.\nTaleen Al-Hinnawi lost her father as a result of the war and is trying to adjust to her new life in Al-Baraka orphanage camp. Signs of shock and sadness filled her face as she spoke to UN News, telling us about her father.\n\u201cBaba [Arabic for dad] was very affectionate,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like Baba was martyred.\u201d\nThe young girl\u2019s outlook on life has completely changed.\nThe war is trying \u201cto wipe out entire families\u201d, she said.\nTaleen said she wished to return to her home in Gaza City \u201cso life can return to normal, study like everyone else and memorise the Quran like everyone else. Before that, we lived in our house. We never bothered anyone, and we kept to ourselves.\u201d\n\u2018We lost them\u2019\n\u201cThis war took away from me my father and my only brother.\u201d\nWith these words, young Nada Al-Gharib began telling her story. She and her mother were also injured in the strike on the tent where the family was sheltering in Khan Younis. They were trapped inside for three days.\nNada said her family had been displaced from northern Gaza to Khan Younis \u201cbecause that\u2019s what the occupation demanded of us\u201d.\n\u201cWe came here, we were trapped. My father and my only brother were martyred, and my mother and I were injured,\u201d she explained.\n\u2018We are like siblings here\u2019\nAfter they managed to leave the tent, Nada and her mother went to the industrial area west of Khan Younis, where they received treatment and were trapped again. They passed through Israeli checkpoints, she recalled, as they crossed into Rafah, which they also fled, and finally ended up at the Al-Baraka orphanage camp.\nShe and her mother found a second home in this camp, she said, \u201cbecause everyone around us has the same story and pain\u201d.\n\u201cWe are like siblings here,\u201d she said. \u201cAll mothers are like our mothers, and all children are our siblings. We love each other here very much. We love our lives. Even though it\u2019s hard and the loss [of our loved ones] is hard for us, we try to live for them.\u201d\nNada said her father was a great, kind man who loved his family very much.\n\u201cHe would never let us do anything difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, things are difficult. We have to fetch water and do things that men are supposed to do, but we have no other choice because we lost them.\u201d\nEscalating hostilities\nUNICEF says the escalation of hostilities in the Gaza Strip is catastrophically affecting children and families, with children dying at an alarming rate. More than 14,000 children have been killed, according to estimates by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and thousands more have been injured.\nAn estimated 1.9 million people \u2013 about 9 out of 10 Gazans \u2013 have been internally displaced, more than half of them children, without adequate water, food, fuel and medicine.\nThe UN agency is calling for an immediate and lasting humanitarian ceasefire, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all children and families in need inside Gaza, including in the northern Strip, the immediate, safe and unconditional release of all abducted children and an end to any grave violations against children, including killing and maiming.",

        "content": "title: One year on, Gaza residents face the worst nightmare as humanitarian crisis deepens with every passing day : Speakers \n content: Round Table on \u2018Humanitarian Cooperation on the Gaza Crisis\u2019\nAt the \u2018First Round Table on the Humanitarian Cooperation on the Gaza Crisis\u2019 organized by the Global Peace Summit (GPS), a diverse group of international and local experts, former ambassadors, defense analysts, and diplomats reached a consensus on the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza and called on Israel to end its aggression against Palestinian civilians.\nChairman of the GPS, Shaikh Mahmud bin Ilyas opened the discussion and welcomed the guests that included key figures such as DrYousef Al-Akkad, General Manager of the European Gaza Hospital, and Harry Sholy from the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). They shared firsthand accounts of the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, particularly focusing on the medical crisis and the devastation of healthcare facilities and the challenges being faced on ground.\nDr. Fouzi described how hospitals in Gaza are unable to operate effectively, with medical staff, equipment, and relief supplies being denied access by Israeli forces. Thousands of trucks carrying vital aid are stuck at the Rafah and Al-Arish border crossings, exacerbating the situation. He stressed that immediate international assistance is needed to address the healthcare collapse and the wider humanitarian catastrophe.\nThe first round (virtual) was moderated by Canadian journalist Robert Fantina. Alexander Lawson, Associate Professor of Law at Ziauddin University noted Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza was entering its second year. He discussed South Africa\u2019s legal case on genocide in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the potential for further international action against Israel under the Genocide Convention.\nAsham Agha Nadeem, Head of Communications for Denmark\u2019s Independent Greens Party, noted a growing sympathy for Palestinians among European citizens, despite the official stance of some governments. Palestinian American author IbtisamBarakat drew attention to the plight of children in Gaza, who have been out of school for nearly a year due to the destruction of educational infrastructure. She urged international support for online education to mitigate the long-term psychological trauma faced by these children.\nRamsey Hanhan, a Palestinian American author, lamented how Gaza, once a hub of agricultural exports, has seen its economy decimated by the Israeli attacks on its farms and orchards. Similarly, LaillaBal Mahdi from the UK said there was ample of genocide in Gaza, citing a sharp rise in the death toll from 40,000 in June 2024 to around 250,000. She called for an immediate ceasefire to halt the escalating violence.\nCo-Founder of GPS, ShozabMajeed, an International law expert, led the second round of moderation with the Pakistani panelists who underscored the international community\u2019s responsibility to push for a ceasefire. Former Ambassadors Dr. Raza Muhammad, President of Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) and Syed AbrarHussain, Vice President of Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), questioned why Western powers were not intervening more forcefully, suggesting that the ongoing U.S. election cycle may be a factor in delaying action against Israel. Both expressed concerns that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might exploit the political vacuum to expand the conflict and stressed on focusing on humanitarian zzzzzzzzz OGDCL-IPRI Chair of Economic Security Dr. Aneel Salman warned of the Gaza crisis\u2019 impact on global markets, particularly the volatility of oil prices, which could trigger economic instability across the region. Brigadier (R) Said Nazir raised alarms about the possibility of Israel using more advanced and lethal weaponry, while Maj. Gen. (R) ZahidMehmood stressed the protracted nature of the conflict and the risk of it spreading to neighboring countries if left unchecked.\nPolitical Officer at the Embassy of Egypt, Hager Abdellatif, also attended the conference. MahamNaweed analyzed Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza through the lens of international law. Former Amb Ali SarwarNaqvi, Executive Director for the Center for International Strategic Studies (CISS), spoke about the historical challenges of transnational efforts from the League of Nations to the present day as the UN was handicapped. He called for the unified efforts of peace-loving states that needed to come together to give a clear message to Israel for a ceasefire by signing a resolution.\nCo-Founder of GPS Syed Muaz Shah concluded the session. Although there was potential for the conflict to expand, yet the recent diplomatic efforts including Palestinian political factions unifying with Chinese assistance and Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent push in the UN General Assembly for a two-state solution gained support from over 100 countries. He confirmed that GPS would continue future discussions on Gaza.\nThe round table ended with a commitment to compile recommendations to be presented to governments and decision-makers, aimed at influencing policy to bring peace and stability to the region and extending support to the victims as per their own capacity.",

        "content": "title: After Gaza, Wednesday 2 October 2024 \n content: After Gaza, Wednesday 2 October 2024\n\nIsrael brings war to Lebanon\n\nThe international community turns a blind eye to civilian deaths.\n\nThe Israeli bombardment campaigns on Beirut, Bekaa and Southern Lebanon have caused hundreds of civilian casualties and the displacement of nearly half a million people. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), its Lebanese member organisation the Lebanese Center for Human Rights (CLDH) and EuroMed Rights Network (EMR) condemn all attacks on civilians on either side of the Israel\u2013Lebanon border. All parties are urged to proceed to an immediate ceasefire by the existing Resolution 1701 of the United Nations Security Council, adopted in 2006. A durable ceasefire must also be implemented in Gaza, as it cannot be de-linked from the Lebanese context. FIDH, CLDH, and EuroMed Rights Network urge the international community to impose sanctions such as an arms embargo and political sanctions on Israel for its gross violations of international law, and continued international crimes.\n\nBeirut, Brussels, Paris, 2 October 2024. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), its Lebanese member organisation; the Lebanese Center for Human Rights (CLDH), and EuroMed Rights Network condemn the ongoing Israeli military aggression in Lebanon. All attacks on civilians by Israel or Hezbollah must stop and Israeli troops must leave Lebanese territory immediately.\n\nTo date, the ongoing Israeli airstrikes that intensified since Monday 23 September, has resulted in over 1640 deaths, including more than 104 children and 194 women, as well as over 20 paramedics. Additionally, around 10,000 people have been wounded, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health. These numbers continue to rise, emphasising the urgent need for immediate action to stop this violence. The Israeli strikes targeted several regions in Lebanon, forcing nearly half a million people to flee to safer areas and seek shelter according to the Lebanese Foreign Minister. It is now clear that Israel has begun its war on Lebanon, with already reports of \u201climited\u201d troop incursions into Southern Lebanon. These give rise to the fear of a larger land invasion, reminiscent of the traumatic experiences of 1978, 1982, 1993, 1996, and 2006.\n\nIsrael claims it intervenes under Article 51 of the UN Charter, which provides for the right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations. However, an attack needs to meet the criteria for self-defence under the Charter\u2014meaning it is necessary and proportionate to the original attack. When the response is excessive, not necessary, or not a legitimate act of self-defence, it then can be classified as an aggression, a crime under international law. Considering the scale of the Israeli attacks against heavily populated civilian areas, these can be considered as flagrant violation of article 51 and constitute a Crime of aggression under Chapter VII of the UN Charter requiring UN security Council\u2019s intervention.\n---\nIn addition, the heavy collateral damage of the attacks also contravenes key principles of international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention (GCIV), which mandates the protection of civilian populations during armed conflicts. Indiscriminate harm to civilians violates the requirement to distinguish between combatants and civilians and to avoid disproportionate harm to civilian life. This constitutes a war crime.\n\nIsrael must be stopped from further escalation\n\nThe signatory organisations consider it particularly distressing to witness the ongoing dehumanisation of the Lebanese civilians. The tacit or open support by several Western governments of the ongoing escalation and the indiscriminate pager and walkie-talkie bombings of 17 and 18 September - that resulted in the deaths of at least 37 people, including two children and left around 2931 others injured, with children and health workers among the victims - are unacceptable. The bombing and raising of habitation buildings for the purpose of assassinations cannot be defined \u201cas a measure of justice\u201d as American President Joe Biden has done, legitimising a view of international relations that entirely substitutes violence to Law.\n\nInternational leaders have a responsibility to show restraint and fairness in a situation in which every escalation causes civilian casualties and suffering on a massive scale. Governments are urged to impose sanctions such as an arms embargo on Israel for its gross violations of international law. A ceasefire in Lebanon - by the Resolution 1701 of the United Nations Security Council, adopted in 2006 - and ceasefires in Gaza must be urgently implemented. None of the repeated invasions and bombardments of Lebanon in past decades have produced any lasting political truce and reconciliation in the region. The international community to take action to put an end to this escalation of violence and to hold all perpetrators accountable.\n\nP.S.\n\n\u2013 International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) \u2013 Lebanese Center for Human Rights (CLDH) \u2013 EuroMed Rights Network (EMR)",

        "title": "Gaza: 1 Year On - Accountability Report",
        "content": "title: Gaza: 1 Year On - Accountability Report \n content: A YEAR OF AGONY\nIt has been one year since the start of Israel\u2019s military response to attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on civilians in Israel on 7 October 2023. Over 1,200 people were killed and 240 people were taken hostage; around 100 hostages remain unaccounted for until today.\nRelentless Israeli bombardments and ground operations were launched and continue to be the daily reality for the 2.1 million people in Gaza. Israel\u2019s military assault has killed over 40,000 people and injured more than 95,000, while more than 10,000 people are estimated to remain missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings, with no way to recover them and bury their remains. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently estimated that at least 25% of those injured have life-changing injuries, such as limb amputations, traumatic brain injuries and major burns, which require urgent rehabilitation now and ongoing support in the coming years.\nEvacuation orders issued by the Israeli authorities are constantly forcing families to move, with no clear destination as nowhere is safe. Confusing messages cause chaos and anxiety, are given at very short notice, and force people to leave in a rush with the few belongings they can carry. About 1.9 million people in Gaza \u2013 90% of the population \u2013 have now been internally displaced, many of them multiple times. This forced displacement has separated families, eroded social protection systems, and exposed people, especially women and girls, to a heightened risk of violence. The evacuation orders also force people to move away from the few available services. About 86% of Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders as of September 2024.\nPeople have been pushed into the Israeli-designated \u2018humanitarian/safe zone\u2019 of Al Mawasi, which now encompasses less than 13% of the Gaza Strip. Like the rest of Gaza, this area has not been spared from Israeli air strikes, proving this zone is far from safe. The area is incredibly overcrowded, and sanitary conditions are appalling. Food is scarce and the lack of clean water and hygiene products is causing outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases. Shampoo, detergent, and dishwashing liquid are largely absent from the market, or available at skyrocketing prices, which most people in Gaza cannot afford. In June 2024, poliovirus type 2, which was non-existent for more than 25 years, was detected in samples collected from the wastewater, and two months later, a 10-monthold baby was partially paralysed after contracting polio.\nThe destruction across the Gaza Strip is enormous. The constant Israeli attacks have damaged more than 370,000 housing units; 79,000 homes have been destroyed completely. About 68% of cropland and roads have also been severely damaged. As of September 2024, only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, while all suffer from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water. Ongoing bombardments and fuel shortages have also forced bakeries to shut down, limiting people\u2019s access to bread, a staple of the diet.\nThe Israeli military built a road, destroying everything in its way, including agricultural land and civilian infrastructure, which has split Gaza in two, cutting off Gaza City and the rest of northern Gaza from the south. There is an almost total absence of fresh vegetables, fruit, and protein sources such as poultry and meat in the markets in Gaza City and across north Gaza. Given the absence of many fresh food items, the population in the north is highly dependent on canned food, but the prices are prohibitively high.\nMPACT ON THE WEST BANK\nIsrael\u2019s war on Gaza has extended to and had devastating impacts on the occupied West Bank.\nIsraeli military operations and attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians have increased there over the past year. Between 7 October 2023 and 23 September 2024, 693 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. In the same period, Israeli authorities demolished, confiscated, or forced the demolition of 1,725 Palestinian structures, such as homes, agriculture, and water and sanitation structures, across the West Bank, displacing more than 4,450 Palestinians. While access and movement for Palestinians was already extremely difficult in the West Bank, it has become increasingly constrained since 7 October. Heightened Israeli restrictions in terms of physical and administrative barriers, including checkpoints, roadblocks, gates, and permit restrictions, have had an extreme impact on people\u2019s access to essential services, employment, and livelihoods. Farmers have been prevented from accessing their land, while direct attacks on their properties have resulted in destruction of crops, irrigation systems and greenhouses. More than 150,000 Palestinian workers from the West Bank used to enter Israel daily for work but had their work permits suspended by Israel after 7 October 2023, leaving those families without sources of income. The extreme mental distress that is produced by the demolitions and Israeli military operations and settler violence have also increased mental health concerns among the West Bank population.",

Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed, injured, or displaced, and vast numbers of innocent children remain traumatised, hungry, and sick. One year on, we are now no closer to a ceasefire agreement than we were during the darkest days of hostilities.\n\u201cGovernments must realise that so long as weapons continue to flow to Israel and non-state armed groups, the war machines continue to be fuelled, and the suffering of civilians will be, in no small part, the responsibility of those who bring fuel to the fire. They hold the key to bringing this tragedy to an end, and they must do everything in their powers to achieve that.\u201d\nDespite immense challenges, NRC continues to offer support for families throughout the occupied Palestinian territory and Lebanon. In Gaza, our teams have managed to remain operational despite multiple displacements and disruptions. The volume of aid that has entered Gaza over the last year has never come close to meeting ever-growing needs. On average, 50 trucks per day have crossed into Gaza in September, the lowest yet.\n\"The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached an unbearable level. The scale of damage and loss is so immense that it will take many years to reverse, but NRC will stay and continue to support communities in all ways possible. My colleagues put their lives on the line to provide the aid that we are able to receive into Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people are still without proper access to basic necessities, like shelter, food and clean water. The needs remain so vast against aid supplies because of Israeli restrictions, the erosion of the social fabric, and a breakdown of law and order. All crossings into Gaza must be opened to allow for a scaling up of aid. There is no excuse for allowing this suffering to continue,\" said Egeland.\nNotes to editors:\n- In Israel, 1,200 have been killed and over 5,400 injured after the 7 October attacks by armed groups from Gaza (OCHA).\n- Israel\u2019s ensuing large-scale assault across Gaza has killed over 41,615 and left over 96,000 injured (Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza).

        "content": "title: A letter from a mother in Gaza: Hardships, heartbreak and hope \n content: A letter from a mother in Gaza: Hardships, heartbreak and hope\n\u2018\u2018This story doesn\u2019t start from day one. It starts from nine months ago \u2013 the day I learned I was going to be a mother.\u201d\nThat day was in November 2023, around a month into the war in Gaza. Ala\u2019a is among an estimated 155,000 pregnant women and new mothers in the Gaza Strip who for the past year have been forced to give birth under fire, in tents, while fleeing bombs and often without assistance, medication or even clean water.\n\u201cThe sound of the rockets and bombs was louder than my happiness, but I decided that with my little baby, we would overcome all difficulties,\u201d she wrote in a letter thanking the tireless health staff who helped her deliver her baby in a field hospital in Khan Younis.\n\u201cWe will survive whatever happens.\u201d\nCatastrophic situation\nThe situation for pregnant women in Gaza is catastrophic: Exhausted, weak from hunger, with health services nearly completely destroyed and none of the hospitals fully operational, they have few places to turn for care and treatment.\nAfter hundreds of attacks on medical facilities, just 17 out of 36 hospitals are even partially functioning.\nFuel and supplies are also running dangerously short, health-care workers are being killed or forced to flee and those that remain are stretched thin at a time when Gaza\u2019s whole population is facing a surge in injuries, illnesses and diseases, including the first case of polio in over 25 years.\nPerils of displacement\nMore than 500,000 women in Gaza have lost access to vital services like pre- and postnatal care, family planning and treatment for infections. Among them, over 17,000 pregnant women are on the brink of famine.\n\u201cAfter seven months, I was forced to leave my home and live in a tent,\u201d Ala\u2019a continued in her letter. \u201cI cried a lot, feeling that my brave baby would never see the walls of his room that I had always dreamed of preparing for him.\u201d\nBut, her anguish didn\u2019t end there, as she was soon evacuated yet again.\n\u201cIt was a cry from the depths of my heart [that I had] to give birth out of my home,\u201d wrote Ala\u2019a. \u201cAfter 50 days I fled under fire, running, screaming and crying because of the bombs. At that moment, I feared I might lose my baby.\u201d\nSome 1.9 million people are currently displaced in Gaza, many of whom have already been forced to move multiple times over the past year. Since the start of the war, miscarriages, obstetric complications, low birth weight and premature births are reported to have risen at alarming rates, mainly due to stress, malnutrition and a near-total lack of maternity care.\nRecalling her time escaping the bombardments, Ala\u2019a wrote, \u201cWe are here, starting from nothing \u2013 no shelter, no home, not even a destiny. We built a tent again, and we promised each other again that we must survive, whatever happens.\u201d\nA glimmer of light\n\u201cTwo weeks later I felt some pain\u2026It was labour pains! [I thought] \u2018No. It\u2019s too early, I want to give birth at home.\u2019\u201d\nAfter four days of labour, Ala\u2019a visited a field hospital in Khan Younis run by UK-Med, a humanitarian non-governmental organization (NGO) that has a specialised maternity unit supported by the United Kingdom and the UN agency for sexual and reproductive health, UNFPA.\n\u201cI came for a check-up and everything was great,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe midwife and nurses were kind and warm. I spoke to Dr. Helen, and she encouraged me to come and give birth there.\u201d\nWhen the time came, they made sure Ala\u2019a delivered her baby safely.\n\u201cI went directly to the hospital at 2am and all the midwives were ready. But, they told me there was no way for a natural birth, it was too dangerous.\u201d\nUNFPA provides the hospital\u2019s maternity unit with reproductive health kits and supplies and ensures staff can offer comprehensive care, including for obstetric emergencies.\nAla\u2019a and her newborn Mohammad have recovered well, despite the ongoing war and lack of clean water, food or security.\n\u201cIt was the best decision to come here to give birth,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI like that they smile all the time even though they are under pressure. They are a great team.\u201d\nHealth care under fire\nThe impact of the war in Gaza on women and girls is staggering: More than 500,000 women have lost access to vital services like pre- and postnatal care, family planning and treatment for infections; over 17,000 pregnant women are in severe stages of hunger.\nUNFPA and its partners are dedicated to providing reproductive health support, distributing life-saving medicines, medical equipment and supplies and deploying teams of midwives and health-care workers at both official and makeshift camps.\nSix mobile maternal health units have also been set up in field hospitals to deliver emergency obstetric care to mothers and their newborns wherever they are. But it is impossible to provide continuous support without a ceasefire, full access to health services and sustained funding.\nDespite all the hardships she has endured, Ala\u2019a refuses to lose heart.\n\u201cFrom Mohammad, my son, thanks for everything,\u201d she wrote, expressing gratitude to the staff at the hospital.\n\u201cWe are grateful for you. I hope that we meet again in better times.\u201d",

        "content": "title: Israel-UN relations sink to new depths \n content: Israel-UN relations sink to new depths\nGENEVA\nIsrael's long-contentious relationship with the United Nations has since Oct. 7 spiralled to new depths, amid insults and accusations and even a questioning of the country's continued U.N. membership.\nAddressing the U.N. General Assembly on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the world body of treating his country unfairly.\n\"Until this anti-Semitic swamp is drained, the U.N. will be viewed by fair-minded people everywhere as nothing more than a contemptuous farce,\" he thundered.\nThe past year has seen repeated accusations from within the U.N. system that Israel is committing \"genocide\" in its war in Gaza, while Israeli officials have made charges of bias and have even accused the U.N. chief of being \"an accomplice to terror\".\nThe heat has been turned way up in a war of words that has raged between Israel and various U.N. bodies for decades.\nAnd temperatures have risen further in recent days amid Israel's escalating strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\"There has been a great deterioration\" in the relationship, said Cyrus Schayegh, an international history and politics professor at the Geneva Graduate Institute.\n\"It has gone from fairly bad to really bad.\"\nU.N. 'betrayal'\nSince Hamas's deadly attack inside Israel nearly a year ago, U.N.-linked courts, councils, agencies and staff have unleashed a barrage of condemnation and criticism of Israel's devastating retaliatory operation in Gaza.\nHamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.\nOf the 251 hostages seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed more than 41,500 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The U.N. has described the figures as reliable.\nIsrael has especially taken aim at UNRWA, the U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees, but its ire has been felt across the U.N. system, and up to the U.N. chief.\nIsraeli calls for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to resign began just weeks after Oct. 7, when he asserted that the attack \"did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation\".\n'Above international law'\nCritics highlight that from the time a General Assembly vote paved the way for Israel's establishment in 1948, the country has ignored numerous U.N. resolutions and international court rulings, without consequences.\nIsrael has always snubbed resolution 194, which guarantees the Palestinians expelled in 1948 from the territory Israel conquered the right to return or to compensation.\nIt has also ignored rulings condemning its forceful acquisition of territory and the annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and the continuing and expanding settlement policy in the West Bank, among others.\nBy allowing Israel to remain in \"non-compliance with international law, the West has been basically making the Israelis believe that they are above international law\", Geneva Graduate Institute political sociology professor Riccardo Bocco told AFP.\n'Impunity reigns'\nRavina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the U.N. rights office, also said a lack of accountability in the Middle East crisis appeared to have made \"the parties to the conflict more brazen\".\n\"We rang the alarm bells multiple times and now there is the impression that impunity reigns,\" she told AFP, lamenting increasing attacks on U.N. bodies and staff expressing concern over the situation.\n\"This is unacceptable.\"\nUNRWA has faced the harshest attacks.\nIt saw a series of funding cuts after Israel accused more than a dozen of its 13,000 Gaza employees of involvement in the Oct. 7 attack.\nAgency chief Philippe Lazzarini has accused Israel of conducting \"a concerted effort to dismantle UNRWA\", which has suffered dramatic human and material losses in Gaza, with more than 220 staff killed.\nNetanyahu demanded earlier this year that UNRWA, which he said \"perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem (and) whose schools indoctrinate Palestinian children with genocide and terror ... be replaced by responsible aid agencies\".\n'Pariah'\nFrancesca Albanese, the U.N. independent rights expert on the Palestinian territories, who has faced harsh criticism and calls for her ousting from Israel amid her repeated accusation it is committing \"genocide\" in Gaza, recently suggested the country was becoming a \"pariah.\"\n\"Should there be a consideration of its membership as part of this organization, which Israel seems to have zero respect for?\" she rhetorically asked journalists last week.\nMeron slammed Albanese as \"anti-Semitic and really an embarrassment to the U.N.\"\nOther experts warned that Israel's disregard for the U.N. was threatening the broader respect for the organization.\nPedro Arrojo-Agudo, the U.N. expert on the right to drinking water, warned of the consequences when U.N. bodies \"make decisions and nothing is respected\".\n\"We are blowing up the United Nations if we don't react.\"",

        "content": "title: Letter to FIFA Council Members Re: Israeli Settlements and the Israel Football Association \n content: To: FIFA Council Members (via email)\nCc: Gianni Infantino, FIFA President\nMattias Graftstr\u00f6m, FIFA Secretary General\nEmilio Garcia, FIFA Legal Affairs and Compliance Director\nRe: Israeli Settlements and the Israel Football Association\nDear FIFA Council Members,\nWe are writing to encourage you to fulfil FIFA\u2019s responsibilities under its Statutes and\ninternational law by ending FIFA\u2019s de facto recognition of and support for Israeli settlement football clubs operating illegally in occupied Palestinian territory, by immediately barring FIFA\u2019s affiliate, the Israel Football Association (IFA), from organizing football activities in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.\nIFA-member football clubs are based on and use land that Israeli authorities unlawfully took from and rendered off-limits to Palestinians, who may not enter settlements unless they have special permits to work as day-laborers, much less participate in football activities. Playing FIFA football in settlements is inherently discriminatory, because Palestinian residents of the West Bank cannot access the pitches on which the games take place, which are reserved for Israeli Jews who have been unlawfully transferred into the occupied West Bank.\nFIFA\u2019s Human Rights Policy commits to uphold its responsibilities under the UN Guidelines on Business and Human Rights, which make clear that FIFA has the responsibility not to enable, facilitate, or profit from serious violations of international law. Israeli settlements are illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention and contribute to serious human rights violations.\nThe International Court of Justice [ICJ] found, in its July 19, 2024 advisory opinion, that Israel\u2019s policies and practices in the occupation amounts to apartheid and racial segregation, and that states are obliged to distinguish in all their dealings with Israel between its territory and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, to \u201cprevent trade or investment relations\u201d that help maintain the settlements, not to recognize as legal any changes imposed by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory since July 1967, and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation. The ICJ opinion specifies that the duty of non-recognition of Israel\u2019s serious breaches of international law also applies to international organizations.\nThe ICJ also set out in clear terms how Israel\u2019s policies on the maintenance and expansion of settlements are unlawful under international law, and called for reparations for Palestinians harmed by Israel\u2019s unlawful actions in the OPT, including the immediate evacuation of all settlers from the OPT, and the right of all Palestinians displaced since 1967 to return to their original place of residence.\nFIFA has been informed about the human rights violations caused by IFA-sponsored activities on occupied Palestinian territory since 2013. In 2015, FIFA appointed a special Monitoring Committee to decide on the issue, within a year. In March 2017, the committee finally presented its draft report, which recommended that the IFA should stop clubs from operating in settlements within six months, or face sanctions. A resolution proposed by FIFA Council President Gianni Infantino transferred the matter from the Congress to the Council. In October 2017, the Council stated its refusal to implement the report\u2019s recommendations, claiming that it \u201cmust remain neutral with regard to political matters.\u201d In May 2024, the Council appointed an ad-hoc legal team to advise it on the matter. The legal team\u2019s report, as shared with the Palestine Football Association (PFA) in September 2024, recommends the Council seek advice from yet another body, the FIFA Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee, on \u201cthe issue of the determination of the territory of the Palestine Football Association.\u201d We understand the Council will take a decision on the matter on October 3.\nSix IFA football clubs are based in settlements. After taking no meaningful action stop clubs from operating in settlements for more than a decade, the FIFA Council should not prolong the harms caused to Palestinians\u2019 human rights and to football by deferring the issue yet again for further study by another internal committee.\nSwitzerland, where FIFA is incorporated, \u201crecognizes the authority of the ICJ and calls on all states to do the same.\u201d On September 18, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling on Israel and other states to implement the ICJ opinion.\nThe settlement clubs violate FIFA\u2019s own rules. FIFA Statutes provide, \u201cMember associations and their clubs may not play on the territory of another member association without the latter\u2019s approval\u201d (article 64(2).) The Palestine Football Association (PFA) has never issued such authorization to the IFA. Article 3 of the FIFA Statutes states, \u201cFIFA is committed to respecting all internationally recognised human rights and shall strive to promote the protection of these rights.\u201d FIFA\u2019s Human Rights Policy \u201censhrine[s]\u201d its responsibility to \u201cuphold the inherent dignity and equal rights of everyone affected by its activities.\u201d\nWe call on the Council to take action to end FIFA\u2019s de facto sponsorship of football in Israeli settlements, which are inseparable from serious human rights abuses.\nSincerely,\nSari Bashi\nProgram Director\nHuman Rights Watch\nNicholas McGeehan\nDirector,\nFairSquare\nFadi Quran\nSenior Campaigns Director\nAvaaz",

Do not go south; anyone who goes south may put his life at risk,\" Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee posted on X.\nHezbollah said Saturday it launched missiles across the border into northern Israel, where air raid sirens sounded and the military said it had intercepted a projectile.\nIn an interview with AFP, UNIFIL spokesman Andrea Tenenti told AFP he feared an Israeli escalation against Hezbollah in south Lebanon could soon spiral out of control \"into a regional conflict with catastrophic impact for everyone\".\nThe UN force said five peacekeepers have been wounded by fighting in south Lebanon in just two days, and Tenenti said \"a lot of damage\" had been caused to its posts there.\nAround Israel, markets were closed and public transport halted as observant Jews fasted and prayed on Yom Kippur.\nAfter the holiday, attention is likely to turn again to Israel's expected retaliation against Iran, which launched around 200 missiles at Israel on October 1.\nIsrael began pounding Gaza shortly after suffering its worst ever attacks from Iran-backed Hamas militants on October 7 last year, and it launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon on September 30.\n- 'Deliberately targeted' -\nOn Friday, Israel faced criticism from the UN, its Western allies and others over what it said was a \"hit\" on a UN peacekeeping position in Lebanon.\nTwo Sri Lankan peacekeepers were hurt in the second such incident in two days, UNIFIL said Friday.\nIsrael's military said soldiers had responded to \"an immediate threat\" around 50 metres (yards) from the UNIFIL base in Naqura, and has pledged to carry out a \"thorough review\".\nThe Irish military's chief of staff, Sean Clancy, said it was \"not an accidental act\", and French President Emmanuel Macron said he believed the peacekeepers had been \"deliberately targeted\".\nBoth countries are major contributors to UNIFIL whose peacekeepers are on the front line of the Israel-Hezbollah war.\nEfforts to negotiate an end to the fighting have so far failed, but Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his government would ask the UN Security Council to issue a new resolution calling for a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nLebanon's military said Friday an Israeli strike on one of its positions in south Lebanon killed two soldiers.\nIn a show of support for Iran's ally Hezbollah, the speaker of the Iranian parliament Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf visited the site Saturday of a deadly Israeli strike earlier this week.\nA source close to Hezbollah said the strike had targeted Hezbollah's security chief Wafiq Safa, but neither Hezbollah nor Israel has confirmed he was the target.\nGhalibaf's Lebanon visit, a signal of Tehran's defiance, comes after Israel vowed to respond to Iran's second-ever direct attack.\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has vowed that the response will be \"deadly, precise and surprising\".\nThe United States is pushing for a \"proportionate\" response that would not tip the region into a wider war, with President Joe Biden urging Israel to avoid striking Iranian nuclear facilities or energy infrastructure.\n- Gaza deaths -\nIran-backed Hezbollah began firing on Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity.\nIsrael's military campaign in Gaza has wrought devastation and, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, killed 42,175 people, a majority civilians.\nIsraeli operations in Gaza continue, with the army laying siege to an area around Jabalia in the north, causing more suffering for hundreds of thousands of people trapped there, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.\nAdraee, the Israeli military spokesman, posted another evacuation warning Saturday for an area near Jabalia.\n\"The specified area, including the shelters within it, is considered a dangerous combat zone,\" Adraee said on X, ordering residents to move to the humanitarian zone in southern Gaza.\nSome residents said they were not prepared to do so.\n\"They tell us to go south, but we won't go because of the dangers and the army is shooting at people there,\" 27-year-old Sami Asliya told AFP.\n\"There is no safe place, neither in the south nor in the north -- everyone is at risk of death,\" he said.\nOn Friday, Gaza's civil defence agency reported 30 people killed in Israeli strikes in the area, including on schools being used as shelter by displaced people.\nAn AFP journalist in Gaza reported heavy shelling, explosions and gunfire Saturday further south in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood.\nburs-srm/ser",

        "content": "title: As a Palestinian living in the US, I have lost friends, job opportunities - and my faith in humanity \n content: It has been a year of heartbreak, a year of horror, a year of hell. I know I am not alone when I say that this has been the very worst year of my life. I have lost friends, I have lost job opportunities and, most of all, I have lost my faith in humanity.\nBut, before I get into that, let me fulfil my duty as a good diaspora Palestinian and recite the obligatory incantation: I condemn Hamas, I condemn Hamas, I condemn Hamas. We Palestinians, you see, are not allowed to open our mouths without someone demanding we denounce violence and condemn Hamas. And then we are told to shut our mouths, to stay silent, while the very same people demanding we decry violence salivate over our deaths and celebrate murder on an unimaginable scale. Anyone an Israeli kills is an act of self-defence. Anyone an Arab kills is an act of terrorism. These are the rules we must all abide by.\nThe US has never been shy about how much it hates Arabs. But ever since 7 October that hatred has shot to such disturbing new levels that I no longer feel at home in this country. Were it not for the fact that I have built a life and a family here, I would get the hell out. Why would I want to stay in a country where Palestinians are so dehumanised that elected officials such as Senator Lindsey Graham can fantasise about dropping an atomic bomb on Gaza \u2013 a place where half of the population are children \u2013 without facing any meaningful censure? Where John Fetterman, who is my senator, openly mocks pro-Palestinian protesters and seems to take immense joy in our pain?\nAnd then there\u2019s the fact that, simply by paying my taxes, I am complicit in the slaughter and starvation of my own people. Increasingly I can\u2019t rationalise living in a country where such a large portion of my taxpayer dollars is spent on funding war and what Kamala Harris has gleefully described as the \u201cmost lethal fighting force in the world\u201d. I live in Philadelphia, where the schools are so underfunded that just four out of more than 200 schools have full-time librarians and 98% of school buildings\u2019 drinking outlets have tested positive for lead. There is no money for schools in the US; there is plenty of money to help bomb schools in Gaza.\nAgain, the US has never been shy about how much it hates Arabs \u2013 and Palestinians in particular. Well before 7 October I was subject to plenty of racism on that front. I\u2019ve had innumerable people tell me that I can\u2019t possibly be Palestinian because Palestinians don\u2019t exist. Still, even though I thought I was numb to how dehumanised we are, the bloodlust has shocked me. At the time of the Hamas attack I was taking a break from my Guardian column to work on a corporate copywriting gig with a large ad agency. The internal Slack channel for the agency immediately filled with people cheering on the bombing of Gaza. I was in too much of a state of shock to say anything to the agency\u2019s leadership and, if I\u2019m honest, I was too cowardly. It\u2019s hard to make a living as a freelance writer and I normally depend on a few corporate gigs a year. I didn\u2019t want to lose future opportunities by speaking up so I kept my mouth shut, my head down, and waited for the bombing to stop.\nBut, of course, the bombing hasn\u2019t stopped. Ten thousand dead Palestinians; 20,000 dead Palestinians; 30,000 dead Palestinians; 40,000 dead Palestinians. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any number of dead Palestinians that will satisfy Israel or that will make politicians in the US finally say: enough. For a while I was delusional enough to think the ascent of Harris might mark a change for the better. But the vice-president has refused to shift on Joe Biden\u2019s unconditional weapons policy; she has refused to acknowledge international law. When she was crowned the Democratic nominee in August, the party leadership refused to put a Palestinian-American on the main stage for even a minute. That\u2019s how little the Democrats think of us.\nAs the death toll mounts, as the humanitarian situation in Gaza \u2013 and now Lebanon \u2013grows increasingly desperate, politicians across both sides of the aisle in the US keep telling Palestinians that our suffering is all our own fault. Let\u2019s remember where all this started: 7 October. Harris repeated this line during her debate with Donald Trump. Tim Walz repeated this line in his debate with JD Vance.\nBut that line is a lie. History did not start on 7 October 2023. While that date may mark a tragedy for Israel, every single day for the last 76 years has marked some sort of catastrophe for Palestinians. My paternal grandparents originally lived in Haifa; in 1948, during the Nakba, they were among the 700,000 Palestinians forced to flee or expelled by Israel. Their home was demolished. They lost everything. Eventually they made it back to the West Bank but then, in 1967, my father had to flee again. He became a refugee, unable to ever return to live in the country where he was born. He has, however, taken me back to visit. I went back to his village when I had just turned six and had a brief taste of what a Palestinian childhood is like \u2013 by which I mean Israeli soldiers shot teargas at me and raided our village to burn the Palestinian flag.\nHistory did not start on 7 October. But as the world stops to mourn it will for ever be a reminder of whose lives matter.\n-\nArwa Madhawi is a Guardian columnist\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The country is experiencing its deadliest period of conflict, with over 1,200 deaths reported in just the last ten days. Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have affected around 1.2 million people, resulting in a mass displacement of 540,000 individuals as per IOM DTM. Essential infrastructure has been severely damaged, with 4,000 buildings destroyed and 20,000 damaged since October 2023. Schools serving as shelters have delayed the school year, leaving children already affected by previous crises, without access to education.\n\nDistributed Food and Cash Assistance since 23 September\n\nLight Ready-to-Eat (RTE) meals 14,000 including 54,000 Bread Packs Food Parcels 2,200\n\nHot and Cold Meals 262,000\n\nmillion in cash transfers US$ 1.13\n\nMany displaced have fled multiple times, and now lack essential items and access to food and shelter, while host communities and centres are also strained. To date, 162,000 people are newly displaced across 800 shelters, adding to the 100,000 already displaced since October 2023. Refugees face worsening conditions due to limited access to shelter and services. Some 280,000 people have departed Lebanon with an estimated 185,000 crossing into Syria as per UNHCR in the past ten days, of which 70 percent are Syrians and 30 percent Lebanese. Rising local market prices are expected to drive up the running cost of hot meal production, leading to increased resource requirements.

Additionally, in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Affairs, emergency cash assistance was distributed to 45,700 affected Lebanese, primarily residing in the seven most impacted districts in southern Lebanon.\n\nBetween 27 September and 03 October, WFP activated two additional kitchens doubling its food meals assistance compared to last week. Since 23 September, WFP distributed 262,000 hot and cold meals, 14,000 light Ready-to-Eat (RTEs) rations, 2,200 food parcels and 54,000 packs of bread.\n\nAdditionally, WFP distributed food parcels to an Organisation of Persons with Disabilities (OPD) hosting people with disabilities.\n\nSupply Chain\n\nDue to the shortage of trucks and drivers willing to operate in conflict zones, WFP is contracting a dedicated fleet to ensure the availability of trucks and drivers to support emergency transport and response effectively.\n\nWFP has dispatched 12,700 light Ready-to-Eat (RTE) rations, 3,900 regular RTEs, and 60,000 bread packs to over 160 shelters across Lebanon, since 23 September. More than 42 trucks have been deployed to the North, Bekaa, and South Lebanon to transport bread, light RTEs, and regular RTEs.\n\nWFP has a stock of nearly 118,800 in-kind food parcels, enough to feed 240,800 people for one\n\nmonth.

CLUSTERS AND COMMON SERVICES\n\nFood Security Sector\n\nThe Food Security and Agriculture Sector (FSAS) scaled-up its response, but the rising number of displaced people has pushed operations to peak capacity. Without additional funding, resources could run out in two to three weeks. Partners are considering to repurpose existing resources to address newly arising and urgent needs, however this may put at risk existing activities and those assisted through them.\n\nSince 23 September, the FSAS partners, including WFP, distributed a total of 510,000 hot and cold meals, 122,000 Ready-To-Eat (RTE) rations and 9,200 food parcels to displaced people residing in shelters.\n\nLogistics Cluster Some truck drivers remain reluctant to enter certain areas in the South without an escort due to ongoing liability concerns. To address this, deconfliction coordination is being strengthened, and the Humanitarian Notification System is currently being piloted and will be activated for one convoy delivering humanitarian assistance to the South this week.\n\nASSESSMENTS AND MONITORING\n\n\u2022 In the past week, WFP closely monitored 15 distribution sites supporting shelters for displaced people with RTE rations and hot meals. The distribution processes ran smoothly, with no packaging issues reported. To enhance the efficiency of emergency distributions, WFP offered on-site guidance and support to cooperating partners.\n\nWFP Lebanon Emergency Response External Situation Report 2, 03 October 2024",

        "content": "title: \u2018I had to evacuate five times\u2019: a year in the life of a Gaza doctor battling to help victims \n content: The confines of Gaza\u2019s Nasser hospital are unrecognisable from just a year ago, its regular patients now joined by a flood of war-wounded and the homeless sheltering in its courtyards and corridors. Even many of its doctors are new.\nAs fighting has shifted through the Gaza Strip during the past year of war, hospitals have been forced to close and doctors to move, seeking the next place to safely operate.\nNasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis is now one of the few left operating at any level.\nDr Mohammed Abu Mughaisib, deputy medical coordinator for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Palestine, is now leading a team working out of the hospital, having shuttled between different locations for the past year.\n\u201cThe hospitals are not the hospitals that we used to know,\u201d he says. \u201cHospitals have specific conditions; they\u2019re organised, there\u2019s only patients [there], but during this war hospitals are places where people are sheltering, bringing their tents, sleeping in the car park and even in the wards because they thought the hospitals are secure.\u201d\nIn reality, even hospitals have often been far from safe, with more than 500 attacks on healthcare facilities in Gaza in the past 12 months of war, according to the UN, including bombing and raids of some of the biggest, such as Nasser and Gaza City\u2019s al-Shifa hospital.\nMughaisib has been displaced from Gaza City and then central Gaza\u2019s al-Nuseirat camp.\nNasser hospital, where he now works, was besieged and raided by Israeli troops in January and February. While most staff, patients and displaced people fled, those who stayed behind described torture at the hands of the Israeli forces, who claimed they had intelligence that Hamas had operated from the hospital.\nIt has been a struggle to keep working, he says. \u201cThe medical staff are part of the population: they evacuate from one place to another, they are displaced, they can be working in the surgical theatre or hospital and receive news that their family have been injured or killed by an airstrike.\u201d\nFears for the safety of his own family weighed heavily on Mughaisib. One day in November, when he was on his way to work in Khan Younis, he received a call from his wife telling him that his children had narrowly escaped an airstrike.\nThey had been standing on the street outside the home they were sheltering in. Only moments after they came inside, an airstrike hit a house opposite, killing 20 people including women and children.\nIn February, he was able to evacuate his wife, three children and father to Cairo. \u201cI had felt that something was blocking my chest. I was relieved because now I knew they were in a safe, secure place, far from this suffering, far from this fear and destruction, and that they were finally able to eat properly, sleep properly, drink properly. And then I continued working.\u201d\nAfter the focus of Israeli ground operations turned to Khan Younis, including Nasser hospital itself, Mughaisib and his teams shifted southwards to Rafah.\nIt was to the same city that hundreds of thousands of other Gazans also fled \u2013 where they were told by Israel they would be safe \u2013 turning the small community into a place that now hosted the majority of Gaza\u2019s population.\nThey operated out of the Rafah Indonesian field hospital until, in May, that area was also made the target of Israeli military operations and people had to flee again, either back to Khan Younis or central Gaza, or another declared safe zone, the al-Mawasi camp on the coast.\nMSF operates there too, but Mughaisib says that camp has also seen deadly strikes.\n\u201cI needed to evacuate five times from one place to another in the south area due to the threat of a military operation in Rafah. I was alone with my only pet, my cat, moving from one place to another,\u201d he says.\nGaza\u2019s healthcare system is in tatters. According to the UN, only 17 hospitals are partially functioning while 19 are completely out of service. Most primary healthcare centres are also out of action, and less than half of patients in critical need of treatment are able to get out of Gaza.\nAs well as conflict-related injuries, Mughaisib and his colleagues must treat wider health issues. He says they are seeing a rise in infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis \u2013 spread through polluted water \u2013 skin infections and hepatitis A.\nAid agencies have repeatedly sounded the alarm about access to food and clean water. Last week, the World Health Organization said it was planning to begin a second phase of polio vaccinations after the first case of the disease in the country for 25 years was reported in August.\nThough moments of joy are few, Mughaisib says he does feel some satisfaction when he and his colleagues are able to entertain the children and distract them from their pain.\n\u201cI always remember the children \u2013 children severely injured, children who had lost a limb, a child of two years [old] who had both legs amputated,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor and so I have to show my strength in front of them, to support them, but these are the patients I remember.\u201d\nFor Mughaisib and the other doctors operating out of Nasser hospital, they are now trying to cling on and provide any service they can. The hospital runs off generators, but these sometimes fall silent when they run out of fuel, and its staff are constantly on edge, working until the moment comes when they might have to move again.\nThey have long hoped for a ceasefire, which they say is desperately needed, but, after repeated promises, no longer have much expectation.\n\u201cAfter a year now, the word ceasefire is a wish, a dream \u2013 it might come true or not, I don\u2019t know. We thought the ceasefire would be in Ramadan, for Eid, but it did not happen; we thought it would be in the end of summer, it did not happen,\u201d says Mughaisib. \u201cOf course we wish there would be a ceasefire but we reached a moment that we don\u2019t believe that it will happen.\u201d",

        "content": "title: What atrocity would Israel have to commit for our leaders to break their silence? \n content: Consider these two parallel universes. One is Gaza, the scene of some of the worst atrocities committed in the 21st century, as Israel\u2019s genocidal rampage offers a new reminder of our species\u2019 capacity for depravity. According to research by Oxfam, more women and children have been killed by the Israeli military in the last year \u201cthan the equivalent period of any other conflict over the past two decades\u201d.\nWhat makes this all the more disturbing is that the figures are conservative: the 11,355 children and 6,297 women listed as violently killed are only those who have been officially identified. Many of the dead have not been recorded in this way, not least the thousands buried under rubble, listed as missing, or incinerated by Israeli missiles, leaving not a trace. Israel\u2019s destruction of Gaza\u2019s hospitals, too, has laid waste to the system of reporting fatalities. Those caveats notwithstanding, in no 12-month period were so many women and children butchered in the killing fields of Iraq and Syria, despite those populations being much greater than Gaza\u2019s.\nThen there is a fresh revelation about Israel\u2019s deliberate attempt to starve Gaza\u2019s population. Last week the US investigative outlet ProPublica reported that the US Agency for International Deveopment (USAid) \u2013 a government department \u2013 had delivered a detailed assessment to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, concluding that Israel was intentionally blocking the deliveries of food and medicine to Gaza. The agency described Israel \u201ckilling aid workers, razing agricultural structures, bombing ambulances and hospitals, sitting on supply depots and routinely turning away trucks full of food and medicine\u201d.\nIn a particularly egregious example, food was stockpiled less than 30 miles across the border at an Israeli port, including sufficient flour to feed most Gazans for five months; it was deliberately withheld. The state department\u2019s refugee agency also concluded Israel was deliberately blocking aid, and recommended the use of US legislation that mandates the freezing of weapons shipments to states blocking US-backed aid. But Blinken rejected these assessments, and the US government has just approved another military aid package, worth $8.7bn, to a state its own agencies have concluded is deliberately starving the population of Gaza.\nNow transport yourself to another universe: that of the British political elite. Two Tory leadership candidates have proposed making loyalty to Israel a central feature of Britishness. The frontrunner, Robert Jenrick, declares the Star of David should be displayed at every point of entry to Britain to show \u201cwe stand with Israel\u201d. Kemi Badenoch declares she is struck \u201cby the number of recent immigrants to the UK who hate Israel\u201d, adding: \u201cThat sentiment has no place here.\u201d Meanwhile, after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack \u2013 with no reported Israeli casualties \u2013 the UK\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, passionately declares, \u201cWe stand with Israel\u201d, in an official Downing Street address. Here is a man who has not mustered the tiniest fraction of that emotion for the tens of thousands of Arabs slaughtered by Israel, from Palestine to Lebanon. What word is there for that disparity in response, other than racism?\nFortunately, these are not the universes inhabited by the British public. Two thirds of voters now have an unfavourable view of Israel, compared with 17% opting for favourable: a record low. Seven in 10 believe it likely that Israel has committed war crimes (just 8% dissent), while 54% believe an arrest warrant should be issued for Benjamin Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity (with 15% dissenting).\nBut this devotion to Israel among our rulers has survived both unspeakable atrocities and ever more repulsed public opinion. In a rational world, advocating a heartfelt alliance with a state engaged in such murderous mayhem would leave you driven from public life in disgrace; here it is the mainstream, respectable position, with those dissenting demonised as hateful extremists.\nWhat exactly is Israel supposed to do to shake this? It has conducted the worst massacre of children in our time, from reported sniper shots to the heads of infants to butchering terrified families in their cars, and now it is clear it deliberately starved an entire population. It stands accused of raping male and female detainees alike, while Save the Children condemns Israeli soldiers for sexually abusing Palestinian children in prisons. It has killed at least 885 healthcare workers, and left women having caesarians and children having amputations without anaesthetics. Its soldiers push Palestinian bodies from roofs in scenes reminiscent of Islamic State. Meanwhile, Israeli ministers, politicians, army officers, soldiers and journalists compete over bloodcurdling murderous and genocidal rhetoric.\nIf a state hostile to the west was guilty of atrocities this obscene, there would be widespread consensus that it was one of the great crimes of our age. But, as the Palestinian lawyer Diana Buttu puts it, \u201cThe world tells us that nothing can justify October 7, and yet everything Israel has done can be justified by October 7.\u201d It is easy to focus on the most rabid cheerleaders of Israel\u2019s actions, but there are also many, from commentators to public figures, who have remained silent or offered cursory hand-wringing, despite their country being complicit in this endless bloodbath, not least with continued arms sales. The horrors of our past were always made possible by the silent.\nSeriously, what does it take? What atrocity could Israel commit before it becomes a matter of public disgrace to champion our alliance? Does a threshold even exist? And what terrible harvest will the west reap for so unapologetically telling the world that it attaches so little value to these Arab lives snuffed out of existence?\n-\nOwen Jones is a Guardian columnist\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "content": "title: Israel-UN relations sink to new depths \n content: The past year has seen repeated accusations from within the UN system that Israel is committing \"genocide\" in its war in Gaza, while Israeli officials have made charges of bias and have even accused the UN chief of being \"an accomplice to terror\".\nsrael's long-contentious relationship with the United Nations has since October 7 spiraled to new depths, amid insults and accusations and even a questioning of the country's continued UN membership.\nAddressing the UN General Assembly on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the world body of treating his country unfairly.\n\"Until this anti-Semitic swamp is drained, the UN will be viewed by fair-minded people everywhere as nothing more than a contemptuous farce,\" he thundered.\nThe past year has seen repeated accusations from within the UN system that Israel is committing \"genocide\" in its war in Gaza, while Israeli officials have made charges of bias and have even accused the UN chief of being \"an accomplice to terror\".\nThe heat has been turned way up in a war of words that has raged between Israel and various UN bodies for decades.\nAnd temperatures have risen further in recent days amid Israel's escalating strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\"There has been a great deterioration\" in the relationship, said Cyrus Schayegh, an international history and politics professor at the Geneva Graduate Institute.\n\"It has gone from fairly bad to really bad.\"\nUN 'betrayal'\nSince Hamas's deadly attack inside Israel nearly a year ago, UN-linked courts, councils, agencies and staff have unleashed a barrage of condemnation and criticism of Israel's devastating retaliatory operation in Gaza.\n\"We feel the UN has betrayed Israel,\" the country's ambassador to the UN in Geneva Daniel Meron told AFP.\nHamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures that include hostages killed in captivity.\nOf the 251 hostages seized by militants, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 33 the Israeli military says are dead.\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed more than 41,500 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has described the figures as reliable.\nIsrael has especially taken aim at UNRWA, the UN agency supporting Palestinian refugees, but its ire has been felt across the UN system, and up to the UN chief.\nIsraeli calls for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to resign began just weeks after October 7, when he asserted that the attack \"did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation\".\n'Above international law'\nEven before October 7, Israel complained of UN bias, pointing for instance to the towering number of resolutions targeting the country.\nSince the creation of the UN Human Rights Council in 2006, more than a third of the over 300 condemnatory resolutions have targeted Israel, Meron pointed out, describing this as \"mind-boggling\".\nCritics meanwhile highlight that from the time a General Assembly vote paved the way for Israel's establishment in 1948, the country has ignored numerous UN resolutions and international court rulings, without consequences.\nIsrael has always snubbed resolution 194, which guarantees the Palestinians expelled in 1948 from the territory Israel conquered the right to return or to compensation.\nIt has also ignored rulings condemning its forceful acquisition of territory and the annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, and the continuing and expanding settlement policy in the West Bank, among others.\nBy allowing Israel to remain in \"non-compliance with international law, the West has been basically making the Israelis believe that they are above international law\", Geneva Graduate Institute political sociology professor Riccardo Bocco told AFP.\n'Impunity reigns'\nRavina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the UN rights office, also said a lack of accountability in the Middle East crisis appeared to have made \"the parties to the conflict more brazen\".\n\"We rang the alarm bells multiple times and now there is the impression that impunity reigns,\" she told AFP, lamenting increasing attacks on UN bodies and staff expressing concern over the situation.\n\"This is unacceptable.\"\nUNRWA has faced the harshest attacks.\nIt saw a series of funding cuts after Israel accused more than a dozen of its 13,000 Gaza employees of involvement in the October 7 attack.\nAgency chief Philippe Lazzarini has accused Israel of conducting \"a concerted effort to dismantle UNRWA\", which has suffered dramatic human and material losses in Gaza, with more than 220 staff killed.\nNetanyahu demanded earlier this year that UNRWA, which he said \"perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem (and) whose schools indoctrinate Palestinian children with genocide and terror ... be replaced by responsible aid agencies\".\n'Pariah'\nFrancesca Albanese, the UN independent rights expert on the Palestinian territories, who has faced harsh criticism and calls for her ousting from Israel amid her repeated accusation it is committing \"genocide\" in Gaza, recently suggested the country was becoming a \"pariah\".\n\"Should there be a consideration of its membership as part of this organization, which Israel seems to have zero respect for?\" she rhetorically asked journalists last week.\nMeron slammed Albanese as \"anti-Semitic and really an embarrassment to the UN\".\nOther experts warned that Israel's disregard for the UN was threatening the broader respect for the organization.\nPedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN expert on the right to drinking water, warned of the consequences when UN bodies \"make decisions and nothing is respected\".\n\"We are blowing up the United Nations if we don't react.\"\nShare your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you've encountered on The Jakarta Post.

        "content": "title: Gaza\u2019s survivors face the mental challenge of ongoing acute stress \n content: Child victims from Gaza who have witnessed their families\u2019 horrific deaths will need psychotherapy for years to learn to live with this trauma.\nEven before October 7, 2023, many Palestinians from Gaza suffered from depression and frustration, injuries and amputations suffered in previous wars, as well as unemployment and poverty. Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) mental health teams have witnessed these effects on Palestinians both in Gaza and in Amman, Jordan, where our teams are providing care to the few children who have been able to medically evacuate from Gaza.\nMore than 95,000 Palestinians have been injured by Israeli attacks since October of last year, of whom 12,000 need urgent medical evacuation, according to the World Health Organization. Only a tiny fraction of injured Palestinians have been allowed to leave the Strip to seek adequate care in other countries, and after a long and murky process. Every evacuation has to be approved by the Israeli authorities, which can take many months and doesn\u2019t appear to be based on clear, transparent criteria.\nMSF calls on the Israeli authorities to ensure medical evacuations for Palestinians in need of specialized medical care, including their caregivers, and for other states to receive and facilitate treatment outside of Gaza, while ensuring that all patients and their caregivers are guaranteed a safe, voluntary, and dignified return to Gaza.\nBelow, Dr. Ahmad Mahmoud Al Salem, MSF psychiatrist at the hospital in Amman, discusses the mental health symptoms of Gazan children at the hospital and the support our teams are providing to improve their well-being.\nWhat are some of the mental health issues MSF teams have seen among Palestinians coming from Gaza since October 7, 2023?\nA lot of patients coming from Gaza to the Amman hospital are experiencing not only post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but even acute stress syndrome. Many young Palestinians have witnessed the destruction of their homes, the killing of their siblings, and some have even suffered life-changing injuries. But on top of that, they are constantly hearing about the loss of more family members and friends.\nThe goal is to support these kids so that they can love themselves and love life again, but they will need this psychotherapy for years to come to support them and to help alleviate the psychological effect of the traumatizing event that they have experienced.\nThis is not a normal trauma. This is a huge, tormenting catastrophe, so psychologically their minds are unable to bear all this stress. These patients usually develop something that we call acute stress syndrome. Acute stress syndrome means that the patients usually [experience] a lot of nightmares and a lot of flashbacks, as well as low mood, insomnia, and avoidance of the whole traumatic memory.\nIf acute stress disorder stays with the patient for more than a month, then this becomes PTSD. But if a patient with PTSD keeps receiving bad news from Gaza that many other family members have been killed, then they develop a new acute stress disorder or a new grief, so it becomes a complex trauma. It's not one trauma, it's a sequence of traumas.\nHow do MSF\u2019s mental health teams treat patients who are suffering from these conditions?\nFirst, we have to diagnose the patient. If the patient has depression, anxiety, or addiction, then we go through medications and cognitive behavioral therapy. But if the patient is suffering from PTSD, we have to go for medications and eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EDMR), as well as supportive psychotherapy.\nIn general, when a traumatizing event happens, the brain does not only save the scene; it saves the emotion [associated] with the scene. So when we want to treat any trauma related to a psychological issue, we have to try as much as possible to disconnect the misery from the memory. For example, if someone was burnt and he remembers the kerosene and the fire on his arm, he will have memory of pain but also the memory of the misery that follows, because he feels that his arm will never be normal again.\nWith EMDR, the aim is to disconnect the memory from the sadness, and to give some hope to the patient, and direct him to once again experience pleasure in the right moment by detaching the past from the present.\nThe aim is to first encourage the patient to experience reality here and now, and secondly to disconnect misery and pain from the memory.\nHow do adolescents deal with trauma they have experienced?\nAdolescents can suffer real misery, as they are just starting to form their personality and their identity. They are beginning to understand their place in the world and they are asking themselves, \u201cWill I be productive one day? Will I be attractive? Will I be able to earn money?\u201d\nAdolescent patients who have suffered horrific, life-changing wounds will need long-term psychotherapy, as they don't only need help to get through the bad memories and traumas, but they need to be introduced to a new and daunting life, where they might not feel accepted.\nTeenagers are forming their identity, so in general, if they have had their limb amputated or their face burned, then the meaning of their independence becomes crushed. They lose their self-esteem, and their identity becomes threatened and hurt. And their feeling of being wanted becomes hurt.\nTeenagers are forming their identity, so in general, if they have had their limb amputated or their face burned, then the meaning of their independence becomes crushed. They lose their self-esteem, and their identity becomes threatened and hurt.\nThese kids need support to rebuild their self-worth and self-esteem. We try to work with them to empower them through occupational therapy and by showing them that they can grow and recover. But it takes time.\nFor someone who is younger, around 10 years old or less, as long as their parents are resilient, they can get through it more easily than someone who is in their teens or someone who is old enough to understand what has happened.\nThese patients need comprehensive and long-term therapy. Here at the MSF hospital in Amman we work with the patients through a myriad of methods, including one-to-one therapy, educational activities, and in more severe cases through psychiatry and medication. The goal is to support these kids so that they can love themselves and love life again, but they will need this psychotherapy for years to come to support them and to help alleviate the psychological effect of the traumatizing event that they have experienced.",

        "content": "title: New report.. De-Gaza: A Year of Israel\u2019s Genocide and the Collapse of World Order \n content: Palestinian Territory \u2013 Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor has released a comprehensive report marking one year since Israel launched its genocidal campaign against civilians in the Gaza Strip on 7 October 2023. During this period, Israel has committed grave war crimes, with the explicit complicity of the international community.\nTitled De-Gaza: A Year of Israel\u2019s Genocide and the Collapse of World Order, the report details the most prominent crimes committed over the past 12 months, thoroughly documented by Euro-Med field teams. It traces the clear elements of genocide perpetrated by the Israeli army, explores the legal frameworks defining the crime of genocide, and scrutinises both the context and ongoing circumstances. The report also addresses the international judiciary's response, and, significantly, the global community's complicit role in allowing the genocide to continue.\nSince the start of the genocide in Gaza, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army, including around 42,000 recorded by the Gaza Ministry of Health, the majority being women and children. In addition, approximately 100,000 have been injured, with thousands of bodies still lying under the rubble and in the streets, unreachable by rescue and medical teams.\nAn estimated 10 per cent of Gaza's population has been killed, injured, reported missing, or detained as a result of Israeli military assaults. Of the 50,292 Palestinians killed\u2014including those still buried under the debris\u201433 per cent were women, and 21 per cent were children. Thousands more have been forcibly detained, with 3,600 still languishing in various Israeli prisons and detention centres.\nAround 3,500 families have suffered multiple losses since October 2023. Of these, 365 families have lost more than ten members, while over 2,750 families have lost at least three.\nThe report details the systematic acts of genocide committed in Gaza, such as the targeted killing of civilians in homes, shelters, displacement camps, and humanitarian-declared zones. Civilians were also killed by military vehicles and tanks, in field executions, through drone strikes, in crowded markets, and even while waiting for aid at relief trucks.\nThe report notes the Israeli military's starvation tactics, the deliberate killing of prisoners and detainees, and the assassination of humanitarian workers, qualified professionals, and Palestinian elites.\nThe Israeli army employs explicit methods designed to inflict severe physical and psychological trauma on the population. These include launching thousands of systematic military assaults on civilians, dramatically increasing deaths among people of reproductive age, separating families, targeting the healthcare system, and imposing brutal living conditions marked by starvation and malnutrition.\nThe obstruction of humanitarian aid further exacerbates these atrocities, creating life-threatening situations for thousands.\nThe root cause of this persecution\u2014the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory since 1967\u2014has created conditions for the ongoing genocide, as confirmed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its advisory opinion of 19 July 2024, on the legal consequences arising from Israeli policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territory.\nBoth the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip are internationally recognised as Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1967.\nUp until 2005, the Israeli occupation army maintained internal and external control over Gaza by stationing military forces within and outside the Strip, establishing settlements on its land, a situation still seen in the West Bank today.\nIn 2005, Israel declared a unilateral \"disengagement,\" evacuating its settlers from Gaza and withdrawing its military forces. However, despite this declaration, Israel continued to exercise control over Gaza, maintaining real authority over critical aspects of governance. The ICJ upheld this position in a recent advisory opinion, reflecting the near-universal international consensus on Israel\u2019s continued occupation.\nEven after its military withdrawal, Israel retained control over the essential governing elements of Gaza, including its population registry, borders (land, sea, and air), and the regulation of movement for both people and goods. Israel also continued to collect taxes on imports and exports and maintained control over the buffer zone.\nFollowing the 7 October 2023 attack, Israel declared a state of war, with its President, Prime Minister, and other political and military leaders at the forefront. The declared aim was to eliminate Hamas, secure the release of hostages, and restore security. Thus began Operation Iron Swords, a brutal military offensive that intensified the suffering of Gaza\u2019s civilians.\nEuro-Med Monitor concluded with a set of recommendations after a year of genocide in Gaza, emphasising that all states, both individually and collectively, are still obligated to work towards stopping the ongoing genocide by all available means. Preventing and punishing this crime is an international legal obligation incumbent upon all states without exception, and it is an obligation of absolute authority towards all.\nEuro-Med Monitor calls for the imposition of a total arms embargo on Israel, the termination of all licences and agreements related to arms imports and exports (including dual-use materials and technology that could be used against Palestinians), and an end to all military and intelligence cooperation.\nIn addition to imposing travel restrictions and freezing Israeli government assets, Euro-Med Monitor calls for political and economic sanctions on Israel and its accomplice states. These measures are intended to pressure the responsible parties into upholding international law, ensuring non-recurrence of crimes against Palestinians, and compensating the victims of these atrocities.\nThe organisation further calls for the halting all forms of support to Israel in connection with its genocide and other crimes against Palestinians. This includes withholding investments, cancelling or suspending political, diplomatic, economic, commercial, and academic ties, and curtailing support from the media, legal, and other sectors that might contribute to the continuation of these crimes.\nKey measures include ensuring the Israeli occupation army's full withdrawal from Gaza, dismantling all military installations, barricades, and checkpoints, ending the imposed military and geographical divisions, restoring the Strip\u2019s geographical unity, and guaranteeing the safe and swift return of forcibly displaced individuals to their homes. Furthermore, the recommendations call for the protection of freedom of movement, travel, and access for all citizens of Gaza.",

        "content": "title: For the second time: Israel\u2019s war machine targets Yemen\u2019s power infrastructure [EN/AR] \n content: Mwatana for Human Rights reported that Israeli warplanes brutally attacked three power generation stations in the coastal governorate of Al-Hudaydah in western Yemen for the second time in a coordinated assault. The attack resulted in dozens of casualties, including six fatalities and 57 injuries, with the victims suffering various degrees of wounds, from severe to moderate. The strikes also caused near-total destruction of the power stations, taking them offline almost entirely.\nAccording to Mwatana, between 4:50 and 5:00 PM on Sunday, September 29, 2024, Israeli aircraft carried out approximately 20 airstrikes on critical infrastructure in Al-Hudaydah. Eight of these targeted the Al-Hali power station in Al-Hali District, two struck the power station at Al-Hudaydah Port in Al-Mina District, and eight more hit the Al-Kathib station in the As-Salif area of As-Salif District. Additionally, four strikes were launched on Ras Issa Port, destroying four fuel tanks, three of which were nearly empty while the fourth was still under construction. This assault immediately impacted hundreds of thousands of residents in the coastal city, as they were left without power in extreme heat, exacerbated by fires and thick smoke from the bombings. Hospitals and healthcare facilities were also affected, with sections like neonatal units and dialysis centers temporarily ceasing operations. The strikes caused widespread panic among city residents and those living near the targeted areas, with fears of a looming fuel crisis prompting citizens in various regions to rush to secure gas and fuel supplies immediately following the attack.\nRadhya Al-Mutawakel, Chairwoman of Mwatana for Human Rights, stated, \"The Israeli fighter jets\u2019 targeting of civilian infrastructure in Yemen underscores their pattern of attacking essential resources for civilians. This assault exacerbates the suffering of hundreds of thousands in Al-Hudaydah and other governorates. The deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, including power stations, ports, and fuel tanks, constitutes a war crime, as it leads to environmental pollution and restricts access to essential services and supplies for the population.\" Al-Mutawakel added, \"This is the second time that Israeli aircraft have struck vital assets indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, all while enjoying complete impunity and the disgraceful disregard of the international community and Israel's allies.\"\nShe further commented, \"This disregard for criminalizing Israeli strikes in Yemen is not surprising, as the international community today continues to ignore the genocide and regional war that Israel has been perpetrating daily for nearly a year. To this day, Israel remains emboldened by this neglect, operating in an environment devoid of genuine and effective accountability mechanisms, all while receiving international support for its actions.\"\nMwatana warned in its statement that the repeated targeting of Al-Hudaydah ports could completely disrupt them. These ports serve as a crucial gateway for the entry of humanitarian aid, essential supplies, commercial shipments, fuel, and medical necessities for millions of Yemenis. This could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe, pushing Yemen into further starvation and suffering. Mwatana emphasized the urgent need for effective measures to curb Israel\u2019s behavior.\nIt is noteworthy that Mwatana's field team in Al-Hudaydah arrived at the incident site immediately after it occurred, while a central team of researchers from its headquarters in Sana'a reached the site hours later. The team assessed the scene, met with residents and survivors, conducted interviews, and determined the nature of the damage inflicted on the site and the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the various areas in the governorate, including the effects of power outages amid the extreme heat. Residents interviewed by Mwatana in the city of Al-Hudaydah expressed their concern about the prolonged power outages in light of rising temperatures and their inability to secure alternative energy sources due to high costs.\nSalah Muhammad (pseudonym - 45 years old), one of the survivors, told Mwatana, \"The residents were rushing and screaming in fear of the bombardment that shook the houses, nearly causing them to collapse on their occupants.\" Meanwhile, Hussein Mukhtar (pseudonym - 55 years old) stated to Mwatana, \"I still hear the sounds of the bombing every time I close my eyes and try to sleep\u2014the missiles in the sky and the explosions still echo in my ears.\"\nMohammed Saleh (30 years old), a resident of Al-Hudaydah, told Mwatana, \"I couldn\u2019t sleep all night because of the heat after the power went out, but what broke my heart was seeing my five-month-old daughter\u2019s body covered in heat rash. Her cries from the pain were unbearable.\"\nMwatana for Human Rights emphasized that the Israeli attacks on civilian infrastructure, specifically power facilities in Al-Hudaydah, could amount to war crimes. These strikes violated international humanitarian law's protection of civilian infrastructure, as well as key principles such as proportionality, protection, and distinction. These attacks undermine the protections granted to essential civilian infrastructure under Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that \"the extensive destruction of protected property and infrastructure, carried out unlawfully and wantonly,\" constitutes grave breaches of the Convention and criminal acts.\nOn July 20, 2024, Israeli fighter jets carried out airstrikes on vital civilian installations in the city of Al-Hudaydah, launching around six dual attacks on oil facilities, fuel tanks, and the docks and cranes at the port of Al-Hudaydah. Additionally, they targeted the central power station located in the Al-Kathib area of As-Salif District in Al-Hudaydah Governorate, northwestern Yemen. The strikes knocked all power stations supplying electricity to the city of Al-Hudaydah out of service and caused extensive damage. Mwatana verified, through field visits to hospitals and medical facilities, the death of nine port workers and injuries to over eighty others. In addition to targeting the central power station in the Al-Kathib area, the airstrikes destroyed three fuel tanks and ignited massive fires that firefighting teams struggled to extinguish, with the fires continuing to burn for more than two days.\nIn its statement, Mwatana called on the international community, including the United Nations and Israel\u2019s allies, to put an end to the unprecedented and reckless actions of Israeli forces in the region. These actions threaten to plunge the entire region into a full-scale conflict, endangering the lives of millions and jeopardizing both regional and global peace and security.",

        "content": "title: One year of a war without rules has left Gaza shattered \n content: As conflict spreads across the region, an immediate and sustained ceasefire is needed more than ever.\nNEW YORK/JERUSALEM, October 2, 2024 \u2014 One year into the escalation of war in Gaza, the medical and humanitarian situation is catastrophic, said Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). Israel\u2019s all-out war and punishing siege have destroyed Gaza\u2019s already fragile health system, repeatedly displaced people who have been forced into smaller and smaller areas, and choked off access to desperately needed food, water, and medicines.\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched a horrific attack inside Israel, leaving 1,200 people dead and taking 251 people as hostages. In response, the Israeli military launched a horrific assault on Gaza that has so far killed more than 41,500 people, wounded 96,000, and displaced approximately 1.9 million people. Violence has since surged in the West Bank, in Lebanon, and across the region.\nWidespread destruction in Gaza following Israel bombardments on October 9, 2023.Palestine 2023 \u00a9 MSF\n\u201cThis has been a year of unrelenting horror and violence against civilians, with no end in sight,\u201d said Avril Beno\u00eet, chief executive officer of MSF USA. \u201cAs this conflict spreads across the region, we repeat our urgent call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. This is the only way to stop the spiraling violence and bring lifesaving care to people who are struggling to survive.\u201d\nMedical needs of Palestinians in Gaza\nPalestinians in Gaza are suffering from war wounds, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and mental trauma while living in overcrowded and inhumane conditions. MSF medical staff have treated patients on a daily basis with wounds caused by bombings. People have extensive burns, crushed bones, and amputated limbs\u2014all of which require intensive and long-term care that is not possible under current conditions. Since the escalation of war last October, MSF teams have treated more than 27,500 patients for violence-related injuries, with more than 80 percent of the wounds linked to shelling.\nOur teams have been forced to perform surgeries without anesthesia, witness children die on hospital floors due to a lack of resources, and even treat their own colleagues and family members. Meanwhile, the health care system in Gaza has been systematically dismantled by Israeli forces.\nDr. Amber Alayyan, MSF medical program manager\n\u201cIsraeli bombardments of densely populated areas have repeatedly caused injuries on a massive scale,\u201d said Dr. Amber Alayyan, MSF medical program manager. \u201cOur teams have been forced to perform surgeries without anesthesia, witness children die on hospital floors due to a lack of resources, and even treat their own colleagues and family members. Meanwhile, the health care system in Gaza has been systematically dismantled by Israeli forces.\u201d\nWell before October 7, MSF was already treating people in Gaza suffering from the effects of Israel\u2019s 17-year occupation, blockade, and recurrent attacks. Teams have cared for patients with life-altering physical injuries, severe burns, and mental health conditions.\nAttacks on health care leave few medical options\nAs medical needs are growing exponentially, people\u2019s options for care are shrinking. Israeli forces have committed widespread and systematic attacks on Gaza\u2019s health care system and other vital civilian infrastructure. The health care system is now on the edge of collapse. Today, only 17 out of 36 hospitals are partially functional. Warring parties have conducted hostilities near medical facilities, endangering patients, caretakers, and medical staff. Six MSF colleagues have been killed. From October 2023, staff and patients from MSF have had to leave 14 different health structures, due to serious incidents and ongoing fighting. Each time a medical facility is evacuated, thousands of people lose access to lifesaving medical care. This will have consequences on people\u2019s health, not just in the immediate term, but in the weeks and months to come.\nThe lack of access to health care is compounded by the lack of humanitarian and medical supplies in Gaza. Israeli authorities have routinely imposed unclear, unpredictable criteria for authorizing the entry of supplies. Once supplies cross into the Gaza Strip, they often do not make it to their destination, due to an absence of safe and accessible roads, ongoing fighting, and looting of food and basic items. The first step in addressing this is for Israel to open vital land borders to ensure massive humanitarian and medical aid can reach those in need. The blockade on Gaza must end.\nThe US has a responsibility to ensure its support is not used to harm civilians\n\u201cFor one year, Israel\u2019s allies have continued to provide their military support to Israel, as children are killed en masse, tanks fire on deconflicted shelters, and fighter jets bomb so-called humanitarian zones,\u201d said Chris Lockyear, MSF\u2019s secretary general. \u201cThis has been accompanied by a consistent public narrative dehumanizing people in Gaza and failing to distinguish between military targets and civilian lives. The only way to stop the killing is with an immediate and sustained ceasefire.\"\nIsrael and Hamas, supported by their respective allies, have failed time and time again to implement a sustained ceasefire in Gaza. While the US led efforts in June to secure passage of a ceasefire resolution by the UN Security Council, it has vetoed previous resolutions brought by other Council members and continues to provide arms to Israel. Israel must immediately stop the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Gaza and urgently facilitate the delivery of aid to alleviate suffering inside the Strip\u2014and its allies must demand they do so. Under international norms and laws, civilians must be protected from violence and have the right to access humanitarian assistance, especially medical care.\nAs a leading ally of Israel, the US has a particular responsibility to ensure that its support is not used to kill and maim civilians, attack hospitals and health workers, and block the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza.\nAvril Beno\u00eet, chief executive officer of MSF USA\n\u201cThe US remains the leading provider of military and financial support to Israel, fueling the destruction of Gaza and the resulting humanitarian crisis,\u201d Beno\u00eet said. \u201cAs a leading ally of Israel, the US has a particular responsibility to ensure that its support is not used to kill and maim civilians, attack hospitals and health workers, and block the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza.\"\nIn Gaza, MSF is currently running medical activities in two hospitals, Al-Aqsa and Nasser Hospitals, eight health care facilities, and two field hospitals in Deir al-Balah. Field hospitals cannot replace the health care system that Israel has dismantled in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, MSF teams have offered surgical support, wound care, physiotherapy, maternity and pediatric care, primary health care, vaccination, mental health services, and water distribution.",

Moreover, this environmental destruction fundamentally undermines the human dignity of Gaza\u2019s residents, depriving them of their basic rights to a clean and healthy environment.\nThe conflict\u2019s impact on Gaza\u2019s ecosystem extends beyond the immediate destruction of flora and fauna. The region\u2019s biodiversity is under severe threat as habitats are destroyed and food chains disrupted. The loss of vegetation, particularly trees, has far-reaching consequences for local wildlife. Birds and small mammals that relied on these trees for shelter and sustenance may have been forced to migrate or face potential extinction. Moreover, the destruction of coastal areas and marine habitats due to military operations and pollution run-off threatens Gaza\u2019s marine ecosystem, thus impacting biodiversity and jeopardising livelihoods.\nThe alteration of the landscape through widespread destruction and the potential for future urban development plans could lead to irreversible changes in the local ecosystem. The contamination of soil and water resources may persist for years, hampering future agricultural productivity and access to safe drinking water. The loss of arable land due to pollution, erosion, and potential salinisation could have severe implications for food security in a region already grappling with resource scarcity.\nDeforestation presents another critical environmental challenge. The destruction of trees, including Gaza\u2019s iconic olive groves, is occurring through multiple mechanisms. Direct damage from bombings and fires has obliterated vast swathes of vegetation. This deforestation not only disrupts local ecosystems but also exacerbates issues of soil erosion and desertification, potentially rendering large areas unsuitable for future habitation or agriculture.\nThe environmental crisis in Gaza is closely linked to a growing public health emergency.\nThe environmental degradation in Gaza is multifaceted, encompassing issues ranging from water contamination to deforestation. One of the most pressing concerns is the contamination of water sources. The intensive bombardment has damaged water infrastructure, leading to the mixing of sewage and potable water supplies. This contamination renders much of the available water unfit for human consumption, cooking, and basic hygiene practices. The situation is made worse by the collapse of waste management systems, resulting in the accumulation of various types of waste, including hazardous medical waste.\nThe scarcity of clean water has far-reaching implications. According to media reports, the displaced populations lack access to basic sanitation facilities, leading to an increase in open defecation and further contributing to the spread of waterborne diseases. The contamination of water sources also poses a significant threat to agriculture. Polluted water used for irrigation can introduce harmful substances into the food chain, potentially causing long-term health issues for the population.\nThe environmental crisis in Gaza is closely linked to a growing public health emergency. The lack of proper burial facilities for the high number of casualties has led to unconventional and often unsanitary disposal of human remains. Bodies left exposed in the rubble, or hastily buried in mass graves, pose significant health risks. The decomposition process releases bacteria and other pathogens which contaminate soil, groundwater, food, and water resources.\nThe breakdown of sanitation infrastructure has resulted in a proliferation of disease vectors. Accumulated waste attracts vermin and insects, spreading pathogens throughout the population. The overcrowded living conditions in temporary shelters, combined with limited access to clean water, sanitation facilities and hygiene products, have resulted in rapid spread of skin and other infectious diseases.\nPollutants released from destroyed infrastructure, including potentially toxic substances from damaged industrial facilities, can have lasting impacts on human health. Children, in particular, are vulnerable to the effects of environmental toxins, which can impair cognitive development and lead to chronic health issues.\nThe environmental crisis also has significant social and economic implications. The degradation of natural resources can exacerbate poverty and social inequality, as communities lose access to traditional livelihoods based on agriculture and fishing. The potential for displacement due to uninhabitable conditions could lead to further social upheaval and strain on resources in neighbouring areas.\nThe scale and nature of the environmental destruction in Gaza have led some experts to classify these actions as \u2018ecocide\u2019. This term, while not yet formally recognised in international law, refers to severe and widespread damage to the environment. The Rome Statute and the Geneva Conventions include provisions that address environmental damage during armed conflict, particularly when such damage is excessive in relation to the concrete and direct anticipated military advantage.\nThe situation in Gaza underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to environmental protection. It highlights the interconnectedness of environmental, climate, humanitarian, and human rights issues and the need for incorporating them into the charge-sheet against the aggressors.\nThe concept of ecocide raises important legal and ethical questions about accountability for environmental damage. It challenges the international community to consider the long-term ecological consequences of military actions and the responsibility to protect not just human life but also make the aggressor pay for restoration of ecological services and rehabilitation of human settlements.\nThe Nuremberg Trials were an important response to the persecution of Jews in Germany, as they addressed crimes committed during the Holocaust and other atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis. These trials were the first instances where high-ranking civil and military officials were held accountable for their actions on an international stage.\nThe persecution of the Jewish community in Germany has come full circle. The time probably has arrived for the proposed OIC meeting to seek UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions to begin prosecution for this ecocide against the Israeli leadership.\nImaan Ali Sheikh is a law graduate from the University of London.\nAli Tauqeer Sheikh is a climate change and sustainable development expert.\nPublished in Dawn, October 17th, 2024",

The scale of the response and the operational challenges faced are unprecedented both in oPt and in other contexts.\n\nALLOCATIONS BY FUND*\n\nSince October, the Pooled Funds have scaled up their funding, enabling rapid and comprehensive humanitarian interventions. In total, the Pooled Funds have allocated $114.2 million since the outbreak of hostilities in oPt. Of this, CERF has allocated $18.7 million, while the oPt HF has provided $95.5 million. Through complementary allocations, the Pooled Funds have leveraged their unique strengths, with the oPt HF supporting frontline local responders, while CERF has focused on ensuring swift responses through UN agen- cies.\n\nPEOPLE ASSISTED IN OPT (2023) CERF 1.85M oPt HF\n\nTIMELINE OF POOLED FUND ALLOCATIONS* CERF 2023 oPt HF\n\n2.4M\n\nGAZA STRIP: In $12M response to the massive displacements following the outbreak of hostilities, CERF allocated $12 million through the Rapid Response (RR) window on 25 October to support urgent humanitarian responses in the Gaza Strip, addressing critical needs across essential sectors.\n\nGAZA $6.7M STRIP/WEST BANK:** In addition, on October 26, a $6.7 million allocation from the CERF Underfunded Emergencies (UFE) window was reprogrammed to supplement the $9 million allocation to Gaza from the oPt HF. The allocation prioritized critical needs that had increased since the oPt HF\u2019s initial allocation, including in the food security and protection sectors, ensuring a holistic approach.\n\nWEST BANK:** In response to the initial increase in $4.2M humanitarian needs, a $4.2 million allocation from the oPt HF was reprogrammed on 7 October to ensure provision of multi-sectoral assistance to the most impacted communities in the West Bank through partnerships\n\nGAZA STRIP: Complementing the oPt HF allocation to the West Bank, a $9 million \u201948-hour response\u2019 allocation was launched by the oPt HF in the Gaza $9M Strip. This funding enabled immediate life-saving assistance through urgent interventions in critical sectors by prepositioning funds with partners before concluding access negotiations.\n\nGAZA STRIP: On December 15, the oPt HF launched a $38.8 million allocation to address the urgent and life-saving needs as outlined in the updated 2023 Flash Appeal. The allocation allowed the humanitarian response to adapt to the evolving situation, with the aim of increasing access to critical assistance for those in need in Gaza.\n\nGAZA STRIP AND WEST BANK: By January, the majority of aid trucks had been damaged or destroyed, severely depleting the humanitarian fleet in Gaza. In response, the oPt HF launched an additional allocation of $3.5 million on 15 January for the procurement of 15 trucks to increase the capacity of partners to deliver aid.\n\nWEST BANK: On 3 April, the oPt HF launched a $5 million \u201948-hour response\u2019 allocation for the West Bank, leveraging pre-positioned funding to urgently address rapidly increasing humanitarian needs particularly for shelter and non-food items for displaced populations.\n\nGAZA STRIP: To complement the $5 million allocation to the West Bank, the oPt HF launched another $5 million allocation to Gaza on 19 April \u2013 in line with the 2023 and 2024 Flash Appeals and the Rafah Offensive Humanitari- an Contingency Plan, supporting a coordinated response for the services most affected, including health, water, and sanitation, addressing issues such as the environmental crisis caused by the accumulation of solid waste, posing a potential GAZA STRIP AND WEST BANK: The oPt HF launched a $30 million allocation to rapidly scale up critical services as humanitarian needs continues to increase.

The situation is particularly difcult for her four children.\n\nWith millions of people on the move and living in informal shelters, addressing water and sanitation needs \u2013 like those Eman described \u2013 is critical.\n\nThe OCHA-managed Pooled Funds are supporting partners\u2019 sanitation response in Gaza. With funding from CERF and other donors, UNICEF is providing emergency water trucking and mobile latrines in the most afected areas. In Khan Younis, oPt HF enabled community cleaning campaigns by \u2018WeWorld\u2019, including trash collection and disposal, in underserved displacement sites to help establish a safer environment.\n\nRead more about the impact of the Pooled Funds on StoryHub\n\nPhoto credit: UNICEF/El Baba 1. \u2018Barely a drop to drink\u2019: children in the Gaza Strip do not access 90 per cent of their normal water use (unicef.org)\n\nThe Pooled Funds will continue to fund humanitarian operations based on available resources and access. Without additional support, the Pooled Fund\u2019s capacity to expand and sustain essential humanitarian activities in oPt could be compromised.\n\nThe Pooled Funds are urgently appealing for immediate contributions.\n\nDonate to the oPt HF Donate to CERF #OCHAthanks our generous donors\n\nFor Switzerland, the oPt Humanitarian Fund is a central mechanism for providing resources - together with other donors - that can be deployed quickly, flexibly and in a coordinated manner where they are most needed. Accordingly, it reflects the values of Switzerland\u2019s humanitarian engagement of effective, relevant action. In view of the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, the collective efforts of humanitarian donors are more important than ever.\n\n- SWISS COOPERATION OFFICE GAZA & WEST BANK\n\nIn the face of the devastating war in Gaza and the escalating violence and restrictions in the West Bank, the oPt Humanitarian Fund has proven to be an indispensable lifeline. The unwavering support of our donors has been crucial in enabling us to respond swiftly and effectively. Given the prohibitive operational conditions, supporting the HF is more important than ever. As the most flexible funding mechanism available, it allows us to adapt to the ever-changing environment and literally save lives.\n\n- MUHANNAD HADI, DEPUTY SPECIAL COORDINATOR AND RESIDENT COORDINATOR, OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS (UNSCO)",

Since the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October 2023, killing up to 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages, Israeli forces have pursued an all-out war on people in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 41,500 people , and wounding over 96,000. People have been repeatedly displaced and forced into smaller and smaller areas under bombardments and increasingly inhumane conditions.\nFor a year, Israel, Hamas, and their respective allies have catastrophically failed to reach a deal on a sustained ceasefire in Gaza, while the risk of a full-blown regional conflict is now increasing. Israel must immediately stop the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Gaza and urgently facilitate the delivery of aid to alleviate suffering inside the Strip, including through the reopening of vital border crossings, in compliance with the measures requested by the International Court of Justice.\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u2019 (MSF) medical staff have treated patients on a daily basis with wounds caused by massive bombings. People have extensive burns, crushed bones, and have been dismembered. Since the beginning of the war, MSF teams have treated over 27,500 patients for violence-related injuries, with more than 80 per cent of the wounds linked to shelling.\n27,500\npatients treated for violence-related injuries\n80 %\nof wounds are related to shelling\n\u201cIsraeli bombardments of densely populated areas have repeatedly caused injuries on a massive scale. Our teams have been forced to perform surgeries without anaesthesia, witness children die on hospitals floors due to a lack of resources, and even treat their own colleagues and family members,\u201d says Dr Amber Alayyan, MSF medical programme manager. \u201cMeanwhile, the healthcare system in Gaza has been systematically dismantled by Israeli forces.\u201d\nMSF teams were already treating the effects of Israel\u2019s 17-year blockade and recurrent attacks on people in Gaza, including treating patients for long-lasting injuries, mental health conditions, and severe burns, inflicted before 7 October. Since that date though, while needs have soared as a consequence of Israel pummelling the Strip, access to healthcare has been reduced to shreds.\nToday, only 17 out of out of 36 hospitals are partially functional. Warring parties have conducted hostilities near medical facilities, endangering patients, caretakers, and medical staff. Six MSF colleagues have also been killed. From October 2023, staff and patients from MSF have had to leave 14 different health structures, due to serious incidents and ongoing fighting. Each time a medical facility is evacuated, thousands of people lose access to lifesaving medical care. This will have consequences on people\u2019s health, not just in the immediate term, but in the weeks and months to come.\nThe lack of access to healthcare is compounded by the dearth of enough humanitarian supplies in Gaza. Israeli authorities have routinely imposed unclear, unpredictable criteria for authorising the entry of supplies. Once supplies cross into the Gaza Strip, they often do not make it to their destination, due to an absence of safe and accessible roads, ongoing fighting, and looting of food and basic supply items.\n\u201cAs the medical needs in the Strip increase, our capacity to respond continues to be limited; we just cannot get enough humanitarian and medical supplies into Gaza,\u201d says Dr Alayyan.\nAs the medical needs in the Strip increase, our capacity to respond continues to be limited; we just cannot get enough humanitarian and medical supplies into Gaza.DR AMBER ALAYYAN, MSF MEDICAL PROGRAMME MANAGER\n\u201cThe field hospitals we set up as a last resort are simply a bandage to fix the devastation caused by the war and destruction of the healthcare system. Even their setup has been hampered and delayed by restricting our ability to procure materials and equipment. As it stands, the medical facilities that remain operational cannot cope with the vast needs,\u201d she says.\nAs the availability of medical care has shrunk so too have the options for people to seek out desperately needed healthcare in Gaza. Repeated evacuation orders have displaced 90 per cent of people into so-called safer zones which Israel has nonetheless bombed over and over again. People are now urged to stay within a tiny patch of 41 square kilometres, with limited shelter, food and water. There is an increased risk of disease due to overcrowding. Out of the two million people in the Gaza Strip, at least 12,000 people desperately need to be medically evacuated. The medical evacuation of those in need, and the right of Palestinians simply seeking safety for themselves and their families to leave the Strip, must immediately be facilitated, without prejudice to their right of return.\nWhile the past 12 months have been marked by destructive actions, they have also been defined by shameful inaction.\n\u201cFor one year, Israel\u2019s allies have continued to provide their military support to Israel, as children are killed en masse, tanks fire on deconflicted shelters, fighter jets bomb so-called humanitarian zones,\u201d says Chris Lockyear, MSF Secretary General. \u201cThis has been accompanied by a consistent public narrative dehumanising people in Gaza and failing to distinguish between military targets and civilian lives. The only way to stop the killing is with an immediate and sustained ceasefire.\u201d\nFor one year, Israel\u2019s allies have continued to provide their military support to Israel, as children are killed en masse, tanks fire on deconflicted shelters, fighter jets bomb so-called humanitarian zones.CHRIS LOCKYEAR, MSF SECRETARY GENERAL\nTime and again, political allegiances have been put before human life. While Israel\u00b4s allies publicly speak on the importance of a ceasefire and need to facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza, they continue to provide arms to Israel. The United States in particular, while recently espousing calls for ceasefire, has frequently worked to obfuscate, block, and undermine ceasefire efforts through its role in the United Nations Security Council.\nMeanwhile, the war in Gaza is fuelling regional tensions, which are reaching disastrous heights. Israeli attacks have surged in the West Bank, and now in Lebanon, with already devastating consequences on civilians.\nOur calls:\n- A sustained ceasefire must immediately be implemented.\n- The mass killing of civilians must stop immediately.\n- The destruction of the healthcare system and civilian infrastructure must halt.\n- The blockade on Gaza must end.\n- Israel must open vital land borders, including the Rafah crossing, to ensure massive scaled up humanitarian and medical aid can reach those in need as a matter of urgency.\n- Israel must ensure medical evacuation for those in need of specialised medical care, including their caregivers, and allow those who wish to seek safety abroad can do so, while ensuring that all are guaranteed safe, voluntary, and dignified return to Gaza.",

        "content": "title: De-Gaza: A Year of Israel\u2019s Genocide and the Collapse of World Order [EN/AR] \n content: Palestinian Territory \u2013 Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor has released a comprehensive report marking one year since Israel launched its genocidal campaign against civilians in the Gaza Strip on 7 October 2023. During this period, Israel has committed grave war crimes, with the explicit complicity of the international community.\nTitled De-Gaza: A Year of Israel\u2019s Genocide and the Collapse of World Order, the report details the most prominent crimes committed over the past 12 months, thoroughly documented by Euro-Med field teams. It traces the clear elements of genocide perpetrated by the Israeli army, explores the legal frameworks defining the crime of genocide, and scrutinises both the context and ongoing circumstances. The report also addresses the international judiciary's response, and, significantly, the global community's complicit role in allowing the genocide to continue.\nAn estimated 10 per cent of Gaza's population has been killed, injured, reported missing, or detained as a result of Israeli military assault\nThe report sheds light on the appalling conditions and systematic atrocities Israel has inflicted upon the occupied Palestinian territory, with a particular focus on the Gaza Strip. These long-standing crimes include the illegal blockade, the deliberate isolation of Gaza from the rest of the Palestinian territory and the world, the systematic deprivation of basic human rights to the Strip\u2019s residents, and the deliberate destruction of essential services.\nSince the start of the genocide in Gaza, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army, including around 42,000 recorded by the Gaza Ministry of Health, the majority being women and children. In addition, approximately 100,000 have been injured, with thousands of bodies still lying under the rubble and in the streets, unreachable by rescue and medical teams.\nAn estimated 10 per cent of Gaza's population has been killed, injured, reported missing, or detained as a result of Israeli military assaults. Of the 50,292 Palestinians killed\u2014including those still buried under the debris\u201433 per cent were women, and 21 per cent were children. Thousands more have been forcibly detained, with 3,600 still languishing in various Israeli prisons and detention centres.\nAround 3,500 families have suffered multiple losses since October 2023. Of these, 365 families have lost more than ten members, while over 2,750 families have lost at least three.\nThe report details the systematic acts of genocide committed in Gaza, such as the targeted killing of civilians in homes, shelters, displacement camps, and humanitarian-declared zones. Civilians were also killed by military vehicles and tanks, in field executions, through drone strikes, in crowded markets, and even while waiting for aid at relief trucks.\nThe report notes the Israeli military's starvation tactics, the deliberate killing of prisoners and detainees, and the assassination of humanitarian workers, qualified professionals, and Palestinian elites.\nThe Israeli army employs explicit methods designed to inflict severe physical and psychological trauma on the population. These include launching thousands of systematic military assaults on civilians, dramatically increasing deaths among people of reproductive age, separating families, targeting the healthcare system, and imposing brutal living conditions marked by starvation and malnutrition.\nThe obstruction of humanitarian aid further exacerbates these atrocities, creating life-threatening situations for thousands.\nThe root cause of this persecution\u2014the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory since 1967\u2014has created conditions for the ongoing genocide, as confirmed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its advisory opinion of 19 July 2024, on the legal consequences arising from Israeli policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territory.\nBoth the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip are internationally recognised as Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1967.\nUp until 2005, the Israeli occupation army maintained internal and external control over Gaza by stationing military forces within and outside the Strip, establishing settlements on its land, a situation still seen in the West Bank today.\nIn 2005, Israel declared a unilateral \"disengagement,\" evacuating its settlers from Gaza and withdrawing its military forces. However, despite this declaration, Israel continued to exercise control over Gaza, maintaining real authority over critical aspects of governance. The ICJ upheld this position in a recent advisory opinion, reflecting the near-universal international consensus on Israel\u2019s continued occupation.\nEven after its military withdrawal, Israel retained control over the essential governing elements of Gaza, including its population registry, borders (land, sea, and air), and the regulation of movement for both people and goods. Israel also continued to collect taxes on imports and exports and maintained control over the buffer zone.\nFollowing the 7 October 2023 attack, Israel declared a state of war, with its President, Prime Minister, and other political and military leaders at the forefront. The declared aim was to eliminate Hamas, secure the release of hostages, and restore security. Thus began Operation Iron Swords, a brutal military offensive that intensified the suffering of Gaza\u2019s civilians.\nEuro-Med Monitor concluded with a set of recommendations after a year of genocide in Gaza, emphasising that all states, both individually and collectively, are still obligated to work towards stopping the ongoing genocide by all available means. Preventing and punishing this crime is an international legal obligation incumbent upon all states without exception, and it is an obligation of absolute authority towards all.\nEuro-Med Monitor calls for the imposition of a total arms embargo on Israel, the termination of all licences and agreements related to arms imports and exports (including dual-use materials and technology that could be used against Palestinians), and an end to all military and intelligence cooperation.\nIn addition to imposing travel restrictions and freezing Israeli government assets, Euro-Med Monitor calls for political and economic sanctions on Israel and its accomplice states. These measures are intended to pressure the responsible parties into upholding international law, ensuring non-recurrence of crimes against Palestinians, and compensating the victims of these atrocities.\nThe organisation further calls for the halting all forms of support to Israel in connection with its genocide and other crimes against Palestinians. This includes withholding investments, cancelling or suspending political, diplomatic, economic, commercial, and academic ties, and curtailing support from the media, legal, and other sectors that might contribute to the continuation of these crimes.\nKey measures include ensuring the Israeli occupation army's full withdrawal from Gaza, dismantling all military installations, barricades, and checkpoints, ending the imposed military and geographical divisions, restoring the Strip\u2019s geographical unity, and guaranteeing the safe and swift return of forcibly displaced individuals to their homes. Furthermore, the recommendations call for the protection of freedom of movement, travel, and access for all citizens of Gaza.",

        "content": "title: Gaza: Israel\u2019s destruction of hundreds of dunams of agricultural land is expression of its insistence on committing genocide [EN/AR] \n content: Palestinian Territory \u2014 Israel has destroyed hundreds of dunams of agricultural land, depriving Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip of agricultural land and resources vital to survival, all in support of its illegal blockade of the Strip and tight restrictions on the entry of food supplies for almost a full year. This is an expression of Israel\u2019s insistence on committing genocide against Palestinians in the enclave.\nThis destruction is part of a larger Israeli plan that dates back to last October. Under this plan, Israeli forces have worked to eliminate almost 80% of the agricultural land in the Gaza Strip from use by Palestinians. Israel has done this either by isolating it in preparation for its forcible annexation to the so-called \u201cbuffer zone\u201d or by bulldozing or destroying it by other means, such as bombardment\u2014all of which are in violation of international law.\nAccording to the Euro-Med Monitor field team, Israeli forces stormed the area of Al-Shimaa in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, early on Tuesday morning (25 September 2024). Accompanied by military bulldozers, the forces began their bulldozing operations, destroying more than 500 dunums of newly replanted agricultural land, which was supposed to sustain the needs of the people living in northern Gaza, who are subject to an arbitrary siege and systematic starvation by Israel.\nThe Israeli destruction of these agricultural lands, the majority of which were filled with eggplants, reflects Israel\u2019s insistence on preventing the Palestinian people from depending on the region\u2019s agricultural food basket during a period when sufficient supplies of vegetables and other foods are being kept out of the northern Gaza Strip. This has led to a severe famine, to the point where a significant portion of the people in the north have been forced to eat tree leaves and bake ground-up animal feed instead of flour.\nTwenty-four-year-old farmer Yousef Saqr Abu Rabie of Beit Lahia told Euro-Med Monitor about the significant losses he incurred on Monday and Tuesday, 23-24 September, as a result of the bulldozing of dozens of dunams north of the town. Abu Rabie stated that although his land is outside of the \u201csecurity zone\u201d established by Israel at the start of the war, the bulldozing operations still occurred, and that the now-bulldozed crops had been bearing fruit that the people of northern Gaza were depending on given Israel\u2019s restrictions on the entry of fruits and vegetables into the northern Gazan markets.\nAs part of its crime of genocide, ongoing since 7 October 2023, Israel has worked over the past year to systematically and extensively destroy the Gaza Strip\u2019s food basket of fruits, vegetables, and meat, along with all other components of local food production, in addition to blocking the entry of food and humanitarian aid. This has resulted in famine in the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli forces have bulldozed or otherwise destroyed all agricultural lands along the \u201csecurity fence\u201d separating the eastern and northern Gaza Strip at a depth of nearly two kilometres, removing approximately 96 square kilometres in a clear attempt to annex them to its \u201cbuffer zone\u201d, in violation of international law. An Israeli \u201cbuffer\u201d road and zone splitting Gaza City through its centre, meanwhile, and the creation of Israel\u2019s Netzarim axis to keep sections of the Strip separate, have resulted in the destruction of approximately three square kilometres of agricultural lands. Thus, the agricultural lands destroyed by Israel to enable the creation of its \u201cbuffer\u201d areas, specifically, represent about 27.5% of the Gaza Strip.\nThe Israeli occupation army has worked to destroy almost all buildings and facilities on the vast majority of these lands, which are now within the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d and are off-limits to residents and farmers. These lands represented the majority of agricultural land in the Gaza Strip and included hundreds of farms built on hundreds of dunams that were planted with vegetables and fruits, as well as hundreds of farms raising poultry and livestock.\nOutside of this \u201cbuffer zone\u201d, additional land has been destroyed by Israeli incursions or aerial and artillery bombardment, resulting in the destruction of at least 34 square kilometres of agricultural land and the streets that service it. This brings the total percentage of destroyed land in the Gaza Strip to 36.9%, or more than 75% of the Strip\u2019s area designated for agriculture.\nOf the very few remaining areas set aside for agriculture, the majority are in the region of Al-Mawasi in the southern Gaza Strip, west of Khan Yunis, which is now home to hundreds of thousands of people who have been forcibly displaced.\nIn addition to Israel\u2019s destruction of thousands of farms, greenhouses, water wells, tanks, and stores housing agricultural equipment, Euro-Med Monitor field teams recorded the intentional killing of numerous farmers while these individuals were working or attempting to access their lands. Since the start of the genocide, the Israeli army has also killed several fishermen and destroyed the majority of fishing boats and fishing ports in the Gaza Strip. These actions have negatively impacted the availability of healthy food for over 2.2 million Palestinians living in the Strip, and the repercussions of this are expected to last for years after the withdrawal of the Israeli military.\nFarmers are finding it difficult or impossible to access areas that have been spared from the Israeli bombing, due to the ongoing bombardment and ground incursions into numerous areas. Additionally, the lack of electricity, destruction of water wells, and scarcity of fuel all make it difficult to cultivate new areas and irrigate them with water. This occurs while aid supplies are being blocked from reaching residents and displaced people in the Strip by Israeli army forces.\nThe ongoing Israeli military assaults have detrimental effects on soil, air, water quality, agricultural land, public health, and the environment. These effects compound over time, and at some point, may result in startling increases in the death rate.\nThe internationally recognised human right to food, water, and sanitation is a basic right that protects population health and dignity. It can only be realised if the international community puts an end to Israel\u2019s crime of genocide; removes the illegal blockade on the Gaza Strip; and salvages what remains of the besieged enclave, which is currently uninhabitable on all fronts. Delays will cause the Strip to deteriorate further, cost more civilian lives, and heavily affect people\u2019s health outcomes.\nThe international community must act swiftly and forcefully to end to Israel\u2019s crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, which involves both the direct killing of, and the imposition of unbearable living conditions on, the Palestinian people there. Israel is attempting to rob Palestinians of all hope of survival by turning the Strip into a place without any of the basic necessities of life.\nThe international community should make sure that humanitarian aid\u2014particularly the basic food and non-food supplies required to respond to the humanitarian crisis safely and effectively\u2014reaches the Gaza Strip swiftly, particularly the northern part of the Strip.\nIn order to save the civilian population in the Gaza Strip from the threat of further health disasters, pressure must also be applied to Israel to permit the entry of materials required for infrastructure rehabilitation and repair. This includes ensuring that there is enough fuel entering the Occupied Palestinian Territory to run desalination plants and wells, among other water and sanitation facilities.",

        "content": "title: A year of horror, vile political point-scoring and the oldest hatred hitting home. And yet I still hope \n content: On 7 October 2023 Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel\u2019s civilian population. By land, sea and air. More than 1,000 people were murdered. It was the greatest loss of Jewish life in one day since the Holocaust. More than 200 hostages were taken. Young people at a music festival near Re\u2019im, and residents in the town of Sderot and small residential communities with names unfamiliar to most Australians \u2013 Kfar Aza, Be\u2019eri, Nir Oz, Nahal Oz, Re\u2019im, Holit, Zikim, Kerem Shalom, Sufa \u2013 were mercilessly attacked.\nThe US Department of Justice later presented terrorism charges against Hamas\u2019 leadership. The words used to describe the atrocities \u2013 armed Hamas operatives attacked and shot civilians, including children, sometimes with machineguns and sometimes at point-blank range, and weaponised sexual violence against Israeli women, including through rape and genital mutilation \u2013 do not, and cannot, fully describe the horror.\nAnd yet, hope.\nCaulfield Park, a few days later. In the heart of Melbourne\u2019s Jewish community. My community. Six thousand worried people. Worried for Israel. Worried for Australia. People experiencing shock and grief. I re-read the sickening words I spoke on that day:\nIsraelis murdered in their homes \u2013 shot as they answered their front doors. Israeli children butchered in their beds. Entire families mercilessly slaughtered in their cars, their kitchens, their living rooms. Men, women and children. Jewish men. Jewish women. Jewish children.\nAnd I weep.\nAnd yet, hope.\nIsrael\u2019s defence begins. With guns and bombs. Of course. How else does a state defend itself? The might of the Israeli Defense Forces could not defend Israel on 7 October. Words alone cannot defend it now. Those who say Israel should not defend itself do not support Israel\u2019s right to exist. \u201cThe river to the sea\u201d \u2013 but with less poetry.\nAnd yet, hope.\nOur TV screens and social media feeds are full of horror. Destitute Gazan families. Dying children. Rockets. Rubble. Many thousands of non-combatants \u2013 innocent men, women and children \u2013 killed and injured and many, many more displaced. The idea that a Jew can weep for a Palestinian, and vice versa, is lost in the fog of war, and a morass of hate.\nAnd yet, hope.\nBlockades of electorate offices. Graffiti. Blood-red paint. Sabotage of communication pits. Even fire. Electorate officers threatened and injured. Australians who need help with social security and immigration left wanting for the sake of protest.\nAnd yet, hope.\nA young professional man, doing what young men do, talking to a politician at an event about this and that. But at the end, \u201cI\u2019m part of the tribe, Mark. Do we have a future in Australia?\u201d\nAnd yet, hope.\nNazi swastikas daubed on small businesses. In Melbourne. In 2024.\nAnd yet, hope.\nSix million dead. Within living memory. I am the son and grandson of Holocaust survivors. Australia gave them the home it denied many others. Yet I am asked why I support genocide. Do they not know the pain that question evokes? Maybe they do.\nAnd yet, hope.\nMore than 100 hostages remain unaccounted for.\nAnd yet, hope.\n[xxxx] the Zionists! You Zionist [xxxx]! And so on. Insert your own profanity. The menu is endless. An ideal number of characters for a Musk/Zuckerberg social media comment. Made for easy-to-use stickers on trains and phone boxes. The slogans even fit on apparel.\nAnd yet, hope.\nSubstituting Zionist for Jew is considered by some a method of expertly cloaking antisemitism with a critique of anticolonialism. Hint \u2013 we know exactly what you mean to say when you say it.\nAnd yet, hope.\nYou must be used to this, Mark. Actually, no. Not in Australia. Australia has been a safe place for me and my family. And my community. Something has changed this past year.\nAnd yet, hope.\nGuards outside primary schools. The kids going through the gates wear short pants. Jewish kids. Yes, the guards were there before 7 October. But now there are more of them. And their parents worry more.\nAnd yet, hope.\nBipartisanship on Israel fractures. The opposition leader says it\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d to maintain support for a two-state solution. The Greens drum up division inside and outside of parliament. Partisan politics trumps everything in pursuit of a cheap social media post, a new headline, a new donor, a new voter.\nAnd yet, hope.\nUniversities become battlegrounds. Encampments generate tension. The special envoy to combat antisemitism, Jillian Segal, tells a parliamentary committee that Jewish students on Australian campuses are traumatised and feel isolated and unsafe. All around Australia Jewish students tell me they don\u2019t feel welcome on campus and they don\u2019t think their universities care.\nAnd yet, hope.\nA senior local government officer I have known and respected for decades is subject to antisemitic abuse. His council deals with the abuse by directing him to work from home.\nAnd yet, hope.\nAbuse and derision directed at anyone expressing concern for the Islamophobia experienced by Muslim Australians, including Palestinian Australians, after the Hamas attack. As if there is a hierarchy of hate.\nAnd yet, hope.\nPeople fleeing Gaza become objects of fear. Labelled a threat though they left their homes with no more than their clothes, their children and hope for a better future. Question time fodder.\nMy friend Josh Burns says: \u201cThe Palestinian people of Gaza, like my family and friends in Israel, did not choose this war and we must maintain our humanity and respect human rights for all.\u201d He cops ongoing abuse.\nLeviticus 19:34 tells us \u201cthe stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as the home-born among you, and you shall love him as yourself\u201d. For many, fear has overwhelmed the kindness that represents their true selves.\nAnd yet, hope.\nWhy so silent, Mark? This, I have been asked a lot. I have thought about it a lot too. I have said little in public about the Hamas-Israel war because I am not the foreign affairs minister. I am Australia\u2019s first law officer. A minister, not a commentator. Just because I\u2019m not talking doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand.\nOver the past year I have watched events on the other side of the world affect my home in an unexpected way. The rise in antisemitism in Australia after the Hamas attack has been truly shocking. Equally shocking has been the reluctance of some on the left to call out Hamas\u2019 behaviour for what it is \u2013 an attempt to kill as many Jews as possible and inflict harm every day since.\nThe failure of many, including the opposition, to show empathy and compassion to people fleeing Gaza has also been inexplicable. The weaponisation of prejudice and hate for political gain is always ugly, and the last 12 months have been very ugly.\nAs a minister I have approved security funding for synagogues, mosques and Jewish and Islamic schools. I have legislated to ban Nazi symbols and other symbols of hate. I have introduced legislation strengthening hate speech laws. The Australian Human Rights Commission in my portfolio is conducting a study into the prevalence and impact of racism in our universities, with a particular focus on the incidence of antisemitism, Islamophobia and the experience of First Nations peoples. I am a member of a government that established Australia\u2019s first Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism and a Special Envoy to Combat Islamophobia.\nI have always thought actions matter more than words. But words do matter, and the words on this page reflect some of the pain, anguish and sorrow I have heard, as well as some of the pain I have experienced myself, over the past year.\nAnd yet, I have hope.\nHope that hostages who are still alive will return to their loved ones.\nHope for a lasting ceasefire that ends the killing.\nHope for the rebuilding of Gaza.\nHope that Israel will maintain its democratic foundations.\nHope for a two-state solution \u2013 an Israeli state alongside a Palestinian state with Israelis and Palestinians living securely and prosperously within internationally recognised borders.\nHope too, for an Australia where the stranger shall be treated like the home-born, where faith-based schools don\u2019t need blast walls and armed guards, and where antisemitism, the oldest hatred, is part of our past and not our shared future.\nI wish for a future where each of us \u2013 no matter our faith, race or politics \u2013 is guided by hope, not hate.\n-\nMark Dreyfus is Australia\u2019s attorney general",

        "content": "title: Enduring Unsanitary Conditions in Gaza \n content: This terrible year of bombings and fighting has led to the death of at least 40,861 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, and as of September 5, 2024, at least 94,454 people have been injured\u00b9. The complete shutdown of all basic public services has created an unprecedented situation in which the population is entirely dependent on humanitarian aid. SOLIDARIT\u00c9S INTERNATIONAL was able to begin working on the ground in February 2024. We have been operating from Deir El Balah \u2013 independently of developments in the so-called humanitarian zone, in accordance with international humanitarian law \u2013 to meet the essential needs of civilians affected by the war. Despite the efforts and successes of the team, the sanitary situation remains a major threat to the people of Gaza.\n\u00ab I could never have imagined seeing such things one day, reports Kathleen Hamon, from the Emergency Office of SOLIDARIT\u00c9S INTERNATIONAL. The situation is catastrophic. The level of destruction is such that, even if the conflict were to stop now, people could not return to their homes.\u00bb It is true that the constant danger, lack of prospects, and extremely difficult living conditions are causing great concern, even among the most practiced humanitarians.\n90%\nof the population displaced from their home\nThe number of destroyed buildings in the Palestinian enclave is off the charts, as is the number of forcibly displaced people. In July, the United Nations estimated via satellite imagery that more than 60% of Gaza\u2019s buildings had been destroyed\u00b2. In the few remaining spaces, more than 2 million people are struggling to survive. The major cities are either under evacuation orders or have been largely razed, so much so that 90% of Gaza\u2019s displaced population is seeking refuge in less urbanized areas, on beaches, along roads, and in any vacant space they can find. Overcrowding and proximity are devastating the makeshift camps. The estimated density in the shelters is 1.5m\u00b2 per person, while the international minimum emergency standard is 3.5m\u00b2 per person\u00b3.\nLife in these shelters is increasingly precarious as evacuation orders come one after another, making it impossible for families to truly settle in. The survey we conducted on-site reveals that, during this year of war, people have been displaced an average of 4.4 times. When the Israeli army announces an imminent attack on an area, civilian evacuations can happen in as little as one day or even one hour. In the urgency and panic, people move with only the bare minimum\u2014generally, mattresses and empty jerrycans\u2014as these families have had to quickly learn to distinguish the essentials from the superfluous. Each displacement further plunges families into misery, as they must pay to find transportation, and arriving in an already overcrowded area makes the situation even more unbearable. Even tents are in short supply, so shelters are constructed from recovered materials. Last come, last served, and one ends up settling in a space that remains empty because no one wanted it\u2014even smaller and increasingly unlivable. With each displacement, individuals are also separated from their social networks, worsening their isolation and vulnerability.\nA near-total lack of essential services\nIn this situation of total disaster, the basic services that a state usually provides have come to a complete or near halt. \u00ab I have never seen a crisis with such a drop in the level of access to services for the population, notes Kathleen Hamon, despite the restrictions that Palestinians have faced for years*. Most were living until now in conditions like those we have in Europe in terms of access to water, food, and education. So this is a real shock.\u00bb* Today, there is no electricity in Gaza, except for a few generators whose operation is hindered by the exorbitant price of fuel. This lack of energy directly impacts access to water. Indeed, aside from the water coming from Israel\u2014which has largely turned off the taps\u2014the water available in the Gaza Strip has always been salty due to seawater infiltrating the aquifers. Before the war, this problem was addressed by desalination plants. The complete power cut by Israel has brought these plants to a halt, reducing water production capacity to 25% of pre-war levels. The international minimum standard in emergency situations is 7.5 liters of water per person per day, but UNICEF\u2074 reports a median water availability of 3 liters per person in Gaza. As a result, some residents are forced to drink unhealthy water, and the inability to maintain a minimal level of hygiene severely impacts their health.\nA health situation beyond control\nThe areas now hosting millions of displaced people from the Gaza Strip were previously sparsely urbanized. Their sanitation systems are not equipped to handle such a large population, especially as they have been heavily damaged by the conflict. As a result, everything is overflowing. Half of the roads in Deir El Balah are covered in sewage. Building and maintaining latrines is often impossible. People are doing what they can, digging holes with whatever tools they have, but the impact of these efforts is minimal. Some 395,000 tons of solid waste\u2075, impossible to collect under these circumstances, add to the heavy toll.\nObtaining hygiene products has also become a major challenge. Prices have reached such extremes that people can no longer afford them. Between July 2023 and July 2024, the price of soap increased by 1177%, and the price of shampoo by 490%\u2076. While the population of Gaza is fully aware of and accustomed to the hygiene practices necessary for their health, they unfortunately no longer have access to them.\nUnsurprisingly, all these war impacts are creating the conditions for the resurgence of waterborne diseases. Without access to soap, water, or toilets, and in such crowded conditions, the risk of epidemics is skyrocketing. A very large vaccination campaign against polio has just been organized, but the overall health situation remains dire. Since January, more than 100,000 cases of acute jaundice and over 414,000 cases of acute diarrhea\u2077 have been recorded in the Gaza Strip. These add to the severe food insecurity affecting the population, and in August, a significant increase in malnutrition was noted.\nThe teams\u2019 ingenuity and the relevance of the aid\nPresent in the region since February 2024, SOLIDARIT\u00c9S INTERNATIONAL has focused its efforts on providing drinking and domestic water. To overcome the difficulties of bringing in supplies, the team took a pragmatic approach: managing to desalinate water using locally available resources. Ingenuity and professionalism have guided their actions. In July, a desalination plant was brought back into operation solely using salvaged equipment found locally. This plant can produce 100,000 liters of water per day. Every morning, SOLIDARIT\u00c9S INTERNATIONAL\u2019s two tankers, along with those of its partners, begin their rounds to distribution points, covering the water needs of 30,000 people relatively satisfactorily.\nThe team also found a non-conventional but effective way to access water from wells in the region by creating a mobile energy production unit. Nicknamed the \u2018Wattomobile,\u2019 this truck makes daily rounds to the wells, operating the pumps for a few hours before moving on to the next well.\nGrowing needs and the uncertain future for humanitarian aid\nDespite its successes, maintaining daily water distribution remains a significant challenge for the team. Evacuation orders have repeatedly halted operations or prevented distributions. Our teams also endure bombings and evacuations. However, the main limitation to our work is the exorbitant cost of fuel. Providing water daily to 30,000 people is a financial drain that threatens the operation of both the desalination stations, the \u2018Wattomobile,\u2019 and the water distribution by truck. Given the current funding situation, SOLIDARIT\u00c9S INTERNATIONAL may be forced to cease its operations as early as December. And yet, we know that the situation for Gazans will only worsen with the arrival of autumn and its heavy rains. Many people have sought refuge in flood-prone areas, where irrigation canals destroyed by the war can no longer channel water. Without other places to shelter families, the issue of managing sludge will soon reach a new level: sewage will contaminate wells and worsen the shortage of clean water.\nThe dwindling stock of chlorine to treat water, combined with the cold winter ahead, suggests a difficult future for a civilian population already severely affected by the violation of its fundamental rights. Civilians must no longer be entangled in war. It is imperative to increase humanitarian assistance, and for that, a ceasefire is necessary. Additionally, the security, financial, and administrative obstacles to humanitarian aid must be lifted. Beyond any political considerations, International Humanitarian Law is a shared good that protects all civilians worldwide. The people of Gaza must be able to live under conditions that comply with the standards of this law.",

        "content": "title: Amid all the darkness: How kindness helped me survive one year of Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza \n content: As I watch the full moon rise above the dark skies of Gaza, all I can think of is the state of moral bankruptcy in the world that has allowed this genocide to go on for one year. Amid all of this, how do we \u2013 Palestinians still surviving in Gaza \u2013 preserve our humanity? How do we maintain our moral compass when everything around us is urging us to let it go?\nI keep looking at my people, and perhaps the greatest blessing throughout the entire calamity being visited upon us is that we constantly urge each other to remain tender toward one another.\nWith all of the violence, pain, and suffering we are living through, we are angry, anxious, and on edge all the time. It is a constant struggle to remain sane, continue to live by our values, and to treat each other gently. But we keep finding energy where none is left.\nThis is where perhaps the Israeli regime of slaughter is right: We are all fighters in Gaza, in Palestine. We are all fighters because we dare to maintain our humanity. This is the battle unspoken, the one we are taking on with nothing but heart and starved bodies, surviving bomb after bullet, and bullet after bomb.\nWe are indeed fighters, warriors, and the population that keeps rising up. The banality of our struggle is missed in how the world sees us: We are not merely victims of Israel\u2019s ruthless wrath and murder; we are the ones directly resisting even if that resistance does not look like what you think.\nStanding together\nDuring these taxing and laborious times, I learned the layers of what it means to have a family, to be a human, and to support each other selflessly.\nWhen Israel targeted Gaza as a whole, it was doing something even more sinister than taking lives and destroying buildings. It was attempting to destroy the intangible things that bind us together. This is the strategy of colonial armies and regimes \u2013 to divide and conquer.\nIsrael wasn\u2019t trying to slaughter us all. It will always preserve parts of the population simply so it can say, \u201cWe didn\u2019t eradicate them, see?\u201d.\nBut what it is doing \u2013 at least trying to do \u2013 is to transform the kinship and safety we feel with each other; to pit us against each other, make us resentful towards one another, and engineer a population that directs its rage and frustration inward.\nWhat Israel, and all of its allies, cannot understand, comprehend, or recognise is that at every moment we do the exact opposite.\nThey have shown us what it means to be savage and inhuman by cutting off aid trucks from entering the Gaza Strip, blocking us from accessing our money, and causing the prices of even the most basic items to rise unbelievably high. But we have stood together from the beginning.\nIt is true some people have become selfish, thinking only of themselves. But others have done everything they can to split the limited amount of food that we have \u2013 even when it is the only food they have for their children \u2013 and share it with others.\nFamily and survival\nWhat we are surviving in Gaza is not just the ferocity of Israel\u2019s lethal weapons; it is also the mental exhaustion, emotional dysregulation, and depletion of hope and faith that the past year has brought. I believe Israel is doing this so that if they ever decide to give us a real opportunity to negotiate, we will seek the bare minimum.\nAfter all, we are made of flesh, bone, heart, and soul \u2013 all fragile components of our human composition; all of which require constant taking care of, and all capable of becoming rotten. The only thing saving us, is us.\nThe family battalion is the battalion that is fighting one of the hardest battles amid this manic episode of liquidation.\nBefore the war, my family wasn\u2019t rich, but I lived a life most girls dream of. I had the luxury of a home, a higher education, and the finest material to paint. I am an oil painter, and I used to paint on canvas. I miss it more than I ever imagined. Of course, we couldn't afford every single thing I desired, but I was content and grateful.\nNow, I see my father during this war struggling just to not make us feel like we can't afford basic things anymore.\nIsrael has made it so we can\u2019t access the money in our bank accounts, and my father has no way of making a living. Still, he has been trying his best to provide us what we need. Even when he can\u2019t, he selflessly offers us the little bit of food we have even if it means he will have to go without, preferring to provide for our needs over his own.\nPulling me through\nAt times I have reached rock bottom, I have lost hope, I have thought, \u201cThis is the end\u201d. I only just turned 22, and I have believed that I will die displaced, that I will be blown into pieces and no one would be able to recognise my features, that I will die hungry without being able to fulfil even my smallest desires \u2013 to eat a meal in my home again and live until I get married and have a family of my own, to die after a long, happy life surrounded by the people I love.\nWhen this happens, amid all the darkness that only seems to get darker, the only thing that pulls me through is my family.\nMy family was forced to flee on 7 October last year from our home in al-Tuffah, a neighbourhood in the historic centre of Gaza City that has existed since the 13th century.\nMy brother, who lives in Deir al-Balah, in the centre of the Gaza Strip, took our whole family under his roof. Thank God, we have not been forced to evacuate again. But we are always afraid. His home is next to a hospital, and hospitals have frequently been targeted by the Israeli military. We did have to escape once, when they bombed the mosque next to the house, but we were able to return.\nHe crammed his own family \u2013 his two daughters and two sons \u2013 into one room just to give the rest of us some space to feel comfortable. This is family; this is coming through despite the scarcity of resources, despite the density of breaths in a single room, despite the bombs around us, despite it all.\nWith me, my parents, sisters, and brothers, and their spouses and children, and my uncle and his family \u2013 there were a lot of us to take in. Twenty-eight people in one house. But my brother tried to make us feel safe during the most horrifying nights. At a bare minimum, he tried to make us feel we were still at home.\nHe crammed his own family \u2013 his two daughters and two sons \u2013 into one room just to give the rest of us some space to feel comfortable. This is family; this is coming through despite the scarcity of resources, despite the density of breaths in a single room, despite the bombs around us, despite it all.\nTwo extremes\nDuring winter months, we shared blankets and hugs. When we woke up cold at night, terrified by the artillery bombardments, we had each other. We gave each other strength and patience. We shared food at the same table. We played cards late at night to ease the long cold nights.\nI remember my sister-in-law. She was pregnant, and she got sick. You know how painful that can be. A pregnant woman is vulnerable and weak already. She was so worried, and it was a freezing winter night. My uncle's wife woke up in the middle of the night and made her a warm soup. I know you might think it is nothing, but it was everything she needed to heal.\nWhen I had a fever \u2013 a very painful one \u2013 I remember my body wouldn't stop shivering under a lot of blankets. My mother stayed there holding me in her embrace. I thought I was going to die. My face was so red, like it was on fire. I remember the whole house was there for me, asking me if I needed anything.\nI couldn't help but wonder, \u201cHow can there be two extremes in the world: humane and inhumane?\u201d Some people fight to do whatever it takes to help each other ease the pain; others keep proving that they have no problem inflicting it.\nI don't exactly know what was wrong with me. I had a bad fever, and my body could not stop shaking. There are so many sick people. There have been huge outbreaks of disease, especially among children. It is impossible to find medicine, and if you manage to find some it is really expensive. There is only one clinic in our area to respond to all of this. It is a struggle to get an appointment \u2013 I never got one. Luckily, I survived.\nThese are the things\nOne day, I was sitting by the beach with my bare feet on the shore. I was really devastated. Miserable. I could not help but cry. A little girl sat by my side. She was very beautiful. Her hair was bleached from the heat of the sun, her skin burnt, and she was asking for money. I had none at that moment to give her.\nWhen she saw me crying, she sat by me and asked me to play with her in the sand. So we played and made a little castle. She managed to make me laugh, and kissed me on the cheek.\nLater, as I was walking down the dead streets, I saw a man selling bananas. I was craving any fruit, especially bananas, as they remind me of home. I used to love eating one every morning before heading to my university. I asked the man how much one cost. The man told me a very high price that I couldn\u2019t afford. I kept walking, but he called after me and offered me a banana for free.\nI ate the banana with tears in my eyes. It tasted like heaven to me because it reminded me of home.\nThese are the things I will be grateful for until the day I die: A kiss on the cheek from a barefoot child on the burning sand; the man who gave me a banana for free because he knew I was craving one and didn\u2019t have the money to pay for it; the people who have been there for me by my side; the people who have opened their homes to their displaced brothers and sisters, and those who share their food and their children\u2019s food with others.\nI am grateful to every single human who has kept their humanity despite the horrifying violence we live in every day.\nEdited by Eric Reidy.",

        "content": "title: More women and children killed in Gaza by Israeli military than any other recent conflict in a single year - Oxfam \n content: Israeli explosive weapons hit civilian infrastructure in Gaza - including schools, hospitals and aid distribution points - once every three hours\nMore women and children have been killed in Gaza by the Israeli military over the past year than the equivalent period of any other conflict over the past two decades, new Oxfam analysis has found.\nAs hostilities and tragic loss of life spread in Lebanon and the West Bank - including East Jerusalem - the regional escalation underscores the urgent need for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.\nConservative figures show that more than 6,000 women and 11,000 children were killed in Gaza by the Israeli military over the last 12 months. Data from 2004-2021 on direct conflict deaths from the Small Arms Survey, estimates that the highest number of women killed in a single year was over 2,600 in Iraq in 2016.\nA report by the organisation Every Casualty Counts examined information on over 11,000 children killed across the first 2.5 years of the Syria conflict, an average of over 4,700 deaths a year. UN reports on Children and Armed Conflict over the last 18 years show that no other conflicts killed a higher number of children in one year.\nIsrael\u2019s military assault began last October, following the attacks by Palestinian armed groups. Almost 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, including at least 282 women and 36 children - the deadliest day in Israel\u2019s history. These targeted attacks committed serious violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). More than 250 people, including 38 children, were taken hostage, 96 of whom are reported to still be held in Gaza.\nSeparate data from Action on Armed Violence up to 23 September shows that Israel hit civilian infrastructure across Gaza with explosive weapons once every three hours on average since the war began. Other than the six-day humanitarian pause last November, there were just two days in the entire year without bombardment.\nRecords - which are not comprehensive - show that Israeli explosive weapons hit on average:\n- Homes every four hours\n- Tents and temporary shelters every 17 hours\n- Schools and hospitals every four days\n- Aid distribution points and warehouses every 15 days\nThroughout the last year, Israel has committed serious violations of IHL at a level which may rise to the level of crimes against humanity. This includes a level of destruction observed which is indicative of Israel\u2019s use of disproportionate force in relation to military objectives and a failure to discriminate between military targets and the civilian population. Israeli military has relentlessly targeted infrastructure indispensable to civilian survival. Civilians have been forcibly displaced dozens of times to so-called \u2018safe zones\u2019 that fail to meet humanitarian obligations and have also been regularly bombed or attacked.\nThe UN Children and Armed Conflict reports show the number of Palestinian children killed by conflict in Gaza and the West Bank. Over the last year, more than five times more children were killed in Gaza than between 2005 to 2022 in total.\nThe record number of women and children killed in Gaza does not include those among nearly 20,000 people who are either unidentified, missing or entombed beneath rubble. Earlier this year, a study published in The Lancet estimated the true number of deaths in Gaza could be over 186,000, taking indirect deaths \u2013 for example, due to starvation and lack of health care \u2013 into consideration.\nCivilian infrastructure has either been completely destroyed or severely damaged, including around 68 per cent of cropland and roads. Only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, and all suffer from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water.\nSally Abi Khalil, Oxfam\u2019s Middle East and North Africa Director, said: \u201cThese staggering figures are both appalling and heartbreaking. Influential actors in the international community have not only failed to hold Israel to account, they are also complicit in the atrocities by continuing to unconditionally supply it with arms. It will take generations to recover from the devastating impacts of this war and there is still no ceasefire in sight.\n\u201cOur colleagues and partners are displaced themselves, yet every day are doing their utmost to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe. It\u2019s unprecedented on so many levels - the fastest acceleration into famine, the re-emergence of polio, the utter devastation of daily life faced by the entire population. Israel\u2019s free pass for impunity and exemption from international humanitarian law must end \u2013 we cannot allow the relentless horror and suffering to continue.\u201d\nDr Umaiyeh Khammash, director of Oxfam partner Juzoor, which is supporting hundreds of thousands of people in more than 90 shelters and health points across Gaza said: \u201cThe past year has had a devastating impact with women bearing a double burden. Many have suddenly become the heads of their households, navigating survival and care in the midst of destruction. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers have faced immense difficulties, including from the collapse in healthcare services.\n\u201cFor children, the trauma is equally profound. Over 25,000 children have either lost a parent or become orphans, leaving them in deep emotional distress. Most children are grappling with anxiety and severe physical injuries, with many having lost limbs.\u201d\nIn the occupied West Bank, the unprecedented escalation and levels of violence are raising concerns that serious violations of international law and war crimes are being committed. Since last October, more than 680 Palestinians have been killed either by Israeli settlers or military violence. More than a thousand settler attacks on Palestinians have been recorded, with direct attacks on agricultural land resulting in the destruction of crops, irrigation systems and greenhouses, including internationally-funded and Oxfam-supported projects. The Israeli military has forced the demolition of more than 2,000 Palestinian homes with massive damage to public infrastructure including roads.\nOxfam is calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages and unlawfully detained Palestinians, an end to all lethal arms sales to Israel and full access across Gaza for humanitarian aid. In light of the recent International Court of Justice advisory opinion and in order to avoid complicity, third states must do everything in their power to bring an immediate end to the illegal Israeli occupation, the removal of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and reparations paid, including restitution, rehabilitation, and compensation for affected communities.\nNotes to editors\n- The data is available to journalists upon request\n- Oxfam calculated the number of women directly killed by conflict comparison based on The Small Arms Survey Global Violent Deaths database, which contains the latest data available from 2004 to 2021. It includes data and estimates on direct conflict deaths disaggregated by gender of the victims. The previous highest number of women estimated to be killed in a conflict in one year was 2,647 in Iraq in 2016. Even accounting for potential under-reporting of women killed in other conflicts, the death toll in Gaza is much higher. It was compared with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) cumulative impact reporton 25 September, sourced from the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.\n- A reportby the organisation Every Casualty Countsexamined the information available on the deaths of 11,420 children in the Syria conflict from March 2011 to the end of August 2013 (approximately 29 months), which averages 394 children a month - 4,725 children a year\n- The Children and Armed Conflict reports issued by the Secretary General of the UN started reporting consistently on grave violations against children in 2006, with annual data for the previous year. The UN reports contain both verified and estimated figures for the number of children killed each year, but even when Oxfam factored in the most extreme assumptions for each estimation and checked additional data sources, the number of children killed in Gaza far exceeds any single year for children killed in all conflicts. These figures were then compared with the OCHA report\n- The total number of children killed in Gaza and the West Bank according to the UN Children and Armed Conflict reports between 2005 and 2022 is 2,304. 11,355 children have been killed so far this year, which is 4.9 times more, when compared with the OCHA report\n- There is limited, verified data available for the number of women and children killed directly by conflict during the Tigray civil war (November 2020 \u2013 November 2022) in northern Ethiopia. While there are some women fatalities for Ethiopia within The Small Arms Survey report, the most referenced data is from the University of Ghentwhich estimates between 300,000 to 600,000 civilian deaths over a two-year period. Of the well-documented 3,074 deaths, 8 per cent were women and 9 per cent children (under 20 years of age). The study estimatesthat 10 per cent of total deaths were victims of bombing and massacres, 30 per cent due to lack of healthcare and 60 per cent due to starvation\n- Human Rights Watch published an analysisof the 7 October 2023 attacks and the Times of Israel documented the number of Israeli child hostages\n- Action On Armed Violence (AOAV) records, investigates and disseminates evidence of armed violence against civilians worldwide. Data from 7 October to 23 September inclusive showed 2,854 Israeli explosive strikes \u2013 including airstrikes, missiles and tank shelling \u2013 with information including the date, event description, number of civilians killed and location. AOAV uses English-language media reports to capture the information. An AOAVreportlast year found that English-language media underreports the number of casualties caused by specific incidents of explosive weapons use, capturing only roughly a third of the actual civilian deaths from specific explosive incidents in Gaza.\n- Counting the dead in Gaza: difficult but essentialwas published in The Lancet in July this year, studying indirect deaths in Gaza due to the war.\nContact information\nSpokespersons are available for interviews.

A further 10,000 are thought to be under the rubble and an unknown number have been taken into Israeli detention. Swathes of Gaza has been razed to the ground.\nThe Independent spoke to those inside Gaza about what they have been through over the last year.\n\u2018I lost 11 people from my family\u2019\nZiad Abdul-Dayem, 55, is a paramedic and ambulance driver. In November he spent 12 hours digging through rubble, trying to rescue nearly a dozen members of his family killed in an Israeli airstrike. He risks his life working day and night to pull survivors from collapsed buildings.\nJust a few minutes after Ziad, an ambulance driver, had dropped his son off at the house where they were sheltering, he received an emergency radio call: the area had been bombed.\nHis son, also a medic, had finished a punishing shift at a hospital in Gaza City, treating the massive influx of wounded from Israel\u2019s offensive. Ziad, whose family had been displaced from northern Gaza, had taken him to get some rest at a flat in Jabalia refugee camp. The extended family was temporarily sheltering there. Since Ziad was the closest ambulance to the bomb site, it was his job to try to rescue survivors.\n\u201cThe house was bombed along with four others. I was digging for my relatives for 12 hours straight. They were all under the rubble,\u201d he tells The Independent in despair.\n\u201cI lost 11 people from my family, including my son, my daughter\u2019s husband, and their children.\n\u201cThe pain and shock were indescribable.\u201d\nHe tried to bury them in the local cemetery, but the intensity of the bombing made that too dangerous. So, he had to bury his family in a mass grave dug with an excavator next to the nearby Indonesian hospital. After that, he says, there was no reason for him to stay in northern Gaza, so he fled south and continued working there.\nHe says the biggest struggle paramedics and ambulance drivers face is being shot at and bombed while trying to get to a scene, along with the lack of fuel preventing them from even reaching the injured. There are days when they have to use donkey carts and tuk-tuks to transport the wounded.\n\u201cWorse than that, there are injuries that are difficult to extract from under the rubble. We do not have the equipment or capabilities to reach those still alive beneath the debris,\u201d he continues.\n\u201cThis is a great tragedy and an obstacle we face often. The injured are alive but die under the rubble because we can\u2019t get them out. We sit and cry. We want to help, but sometimes we cannot.\u201d Ziad has personally lost 10 colleagues, all ambulance drivers, since Israel began its offensive. Israel denies targeting healthcare facilities but the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates since October 2023, there have been hundreds of attacks on healthcare in Gaza, resulting in 765 deaths.\nOne of Ziad\u2019s colleagues was fatally wounded while sitting in the same vehicle next to him. \u201cHe was hit by shrapnel that sliced off his hand directly,\u201d Ziad says. Now, he feels he has nothing left to live for but his work. \u201cI have no home, no shelter, and little family left. This has pushed me to work all week long, always with the ambulance, working 24 hours a day.\n\u201cAll I wish is for this war and this tragedy to end. What we have lived through is enough,\u201d he adds.\n\u2018Not being able to return to your home is the hardest feeling\u2019\nNedal Hamdouna, a journalist from north Gaza, has had to flee his home and places of shelter five times in the last year. Israeli airstrikes have killed several family members. Despite this, he continues to work from a tent, with little access to food and water.\nIf Nedal, 36, had known the Israeli military intended to cut Gaza into two parts, he says he wouldn\u2019t have left his beloved home in the northern part of the Strip a year ago. He lived in Beit Lahia, a town whose adjacent fields were once famous for Gaza\u2019s lush strawberry crops.\nBut after fleeing bombing and bullets with his family five times, he now lives in a tent in what Israel calls the \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in al-Mawasi coastal region. In reality, it\u2019s a beachside wasteland packed with tens of thousands of civilians, which has also been bombed multiple times.\nNedal has no idea when the next flyers will fall from the sky ordering him to move again, when the bombings will start, or how long it will be until he is ever permitted to go home \u2013 if his home is still standing.\nHe keeps working despite the dangers.\n\u201cNot being able to return to your home is the hardest feeling you\u2019ll have every day. Our home is only a few kilometres away, and yet you can\u2019t return,\u201d he says, the pain creeping through his voice in a message sent to The Independent.\nGaza is the deadliest place on earth to operate as a journalist. Israel has repeatedly denied targeting media workers. But the Reporters Without Borders organisation says that since October 2023 more than 130 journalists have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza, at least 32 of them while working.\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists says the number is so high that more journalists were killed in Gaza in the last 10 weeks of 2023 than have ever been killed in a single country in an entire year. Nedal keeps working despite the risks. He speaks of how last time he fled from within the so-called humanitarian zone two months ago, Israeli quadcopters were overhead. \u201cThe bullets penetrated the tents, and dozens were injured. Many were killed in the area as it was suddenly close to the Israeli operation area, but there were no orders to evacuate. It forced us to flee without taking anything.\u201d He says he saw \u201cscenes of pain, fatigue, fear\u201d on repeat, with most people running with nothing.\n\u201cThe streets were crowded, and many were waiting for a car or a donkey cart. I got in the car but had to get out and continue walking with my family, as walking was faster. There is no fuel. People were in the streets with no idea where to go.\u201d When the operation was finally over, he saw the tents were riddled with bullet holes, and some of their remaining belongings had been stolen.\n\u201cIn this war, we have lost many relatives, neighbours, and friends. I even lost my aunt, who was shot while she was in her tent in Deir al-Balah just two months ago,\u201d he tells The Independent.\nAnother major problem is the shortage of food and water. The price of food is exorbitantly high. Vegetables are now 10 times as expensive as they were before the war. A kilo of tomatoes has now reached nearly $10 ( nearly \u00a38). Prices are unstable.\n\u201cMost people live on canned food,\u201d he explains, adding that they cook on a fire, but finding firewood is sometimes impossible.\n\u201cIt is a tiring day in every single detail. Every time you are forced to flee, you have to figure out how to get clean water to drink and where to build a tent... Even the cost of a tent is four times higher than the normal price. Every time you are displaced, you bear the cost of transporting your things.\n\u201cLife in a tent is difficult. You face extreme heat in the summer and cold in the winter,\u201d he adds.\nDespite all of this, Nedal continues working, reporting on Gaza from his tent. He works every day, trying to find a way to charge his phone or connect to the internet. He is dedicated to getting the stories of everyday people in Gaza out to the world.\n\u201cI only dream of returning to my home and checking on our belongings. Its value is more than material. I don\u2019t have enough words to express how much pain we feel.\u201d\n\u2018You arrive at the hospital tired and exhausted, and then start working immediately\u2019\nDr Musa AbuJarad is a paediatrician who was forced to flee northern Gaza when food ran out and the bombing intensified. He later escaped Al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah when Israeli forces took control of the area. Dr AbuJarad has had to assist in performing surgeries without anaesthetic amid a lack of supplies.\nOn most days, Dr AbuJarad and his colleagues face impossible dilemmas: saving a dying patient\u2019s life often requires performing surgery without anaesthesia.\nThey also have to decide who from a group of wounded patients to treat, as there are never enough supplies to help all.\n\u201cWhen you are weighing whether one person\u2019s chance of survival is greater than another\u2019s, you just have to deal with it,\u201d he says grimly.\nDr AbuJarad began the war as a paediatrician at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza City, but he evacuated south after surviving on just a few pieces of bread a day.\n\u201cWe fled to the south, escaping death, searching for survival, for better living conditions, and for food,\u201d he says. He describes that journey as one of the most terrifying moments of the war. Some of his colleagues were detained by Israeli forces along the way; he has no idea what happened to them. Others were killed.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether the shooting was at us or someone else. We didn\u2019t know if we would be taken or not. Even those who were taken by Israeli forces right in front of us\u2013 we still don\u2019t know what their fate is. Are they alive? Imprisoned? We have no idea,\u201d he says.\nThe WHO estimates that at least 214 medics have been detained by Israeli forces while on duty since the war began, the whereabouts of many are unknown. Israel has accused Hamas militants of using hospitals as military bases or command outposts \u2013 a claim vehemently denied by the Palestinian health ministry and refuted by international aid and human rights organisations.\nHalf of Gaza\u2019s hospitals are now only partially operational, adding immense pressure on medics. Dr AbuJarad moved to Rafah, the southern border town near Egypt, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had also fled. At Al-Najjar Hospital, he tried to treat a relentless stream of patients injured across the strip, while medical and food supplies dwindled. \u201cWe were working almost 24 hours a day. We didn\u2019t rest,\u201d he says.\nThen Israeli forces took over Rafah and they had to evacuate the hospital. The whereabouts of some staff members who remained behind to care for patients are unknown. Now, Dr AbuJarad works at a hospital in Khan Younis. He walks half an hour to get to work, hoping to hitch a ride from a truck, car, or tuk-tuk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to you and your luck. The road is difficult, and you arrive at the hospital tired and exhausted, and then start working immediately,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThere are not enough medications, especially painkillers, whether in pharmacies or elsewhere. Our people are living in difficult conditions, which cannot be described.\u201d",

Recent hostilities have tragically led to a surge in attacks on schools, exacerbating the dire humanitarian crisis. This have a severe nega\u00ad tive affect on psychosocial well-being of students, teachers and caregivers.\n\nSince October 7th, the Edu\u00ad cation Cluster \u201cEC\u201d has been monitoring and reporting on damages to schools through initial reports from Cluster partners in the field, UNOCHA,\n\nand UNRWA. In addition, the EC has activated the Educa\u00ad tion Cluster Assessment Team (ECAT) that has been deployed to verify damages on each oc\u00ad casion the situation allowed.\n---\nObjective Methodology\n\nDue to the increased access limita\u00ad tion to the field across the Gaza Strip, and the intense Israeli bombardment from air, land, and sea across much of the Gaza Strip, in addition to recur\u00ad rent telecommunication shutdowns, the Cluster administered a Satel\u00ad lite-derived Damage Assessment to: \u2022 To update the results of the pre\u00ad vious report on school damages based on proximity to damaged sites including new trends and severity of damages. \u2022 To better understand the situa\u00ad tion of school buildings and the severity of damage, especially in areas with limited field access. \u2022 To help in updating the Flash Appeal as part of the Cluster Response Plan and allocate resources where they are most needed, ensuring a swift and effective recovery process.\n\n\u2022 Communicate the impact of the ongoing hostilities on school facilities to the public, including humanitarian actors. This infor\u00ad mation helps raise awareness about the severity of the situation and can facilitate evidence-based engagement in recovery efforts. The Education Cluster published the first update of the \u201cVerifica\u00ad tion of damages to schools based on proximity to damaged sites\u201d on the 10th of February, the second update on the 26th of March, the third update on the 25th of April, the fourth update on the 3rd June, and the fifth update on the 28th July.\n\n\u2022 Tools: 1.

Direct Direct hit hit: at least one school building has been directly directly hit and at least one damaged school structure has been identified within school premises.\n\n2. 2. Damaged Damaged: at least one damaged site has been identified within 30m of the school build\u00ad ings. This could indicate severe severe damage damage to school structures. A hit within school premises but not directly to a building (for example: a hit to school playground) is classified under this category.\n\n3. 3. Likely Likely damaged damaged: at least one damaged site has been identified within 30-70m of the school buildings. This could indicate moderate moderate damage damage to school structures.\n\n4. 4. Possible Possible damage damage: at least one damaged site has been identified within 70-100m of the school buildings. This could indicate minor minor damage damage to school structures.\n\n5. 5. Unknown Unknown: school buildings with no reported damage sites within 100m. This could indicate that school structures have not not sustained damage.\n---\nBuilding Footprints\n\nBuilding footprint is a polygon, representing a specific building structure in the physical world.\n\nTo represent schools using building footprints rather than points, to enhance the proximity analysis, the Assessment Team uti\u00ad lized Microsoft Building Footprints for the Gaza Strip which has 280,227 features as building footprints. Accordingly, the Assess\u00ad ment Team linked relevant building footprints to their respective schools.\n---\nGaza Strip\n\nThe Gaza Strip (365 km2), with 2.3 million population is one of the most densely populated areas in the world at 5,900 residents/ square kilometer.\n\nSchool buildings\n\nMore than 625K students and 22K teachers previously attend\u00ad ed 815 schools (operating in 564 school buildings).\n\nand Damaged sites\n\nAccording to satellite imagery analysis of most recently collected satellite image on 06 September 2024, UNOSAT identified 52,564 destroyed structures, 18,913 se\u00ad verely damaged structures, 56,710 mod\u00ad erately damaged structures, and 35,591 possibly damaged structures for a total of 163,778 structures.

The Gaza Strip is covered on Mondays and Fridays, and the West Bank is covered on Wednesdays. The next update will be issued on 2 October.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nAddressing the critical needs of over 2.1 million people during the rainy season cannot happen without unimpeded humanitarian access into and across Gaza.\n\nMany of the 215 temporary learning spaces serving nearly 34,000 children now risk being severely affected by upcoming floodings, the Education Cluster warns.\n\nHumanitarian organizations are providing about 600,000 daily meals across Gaza, but over 1.4 million people did not receive their food rations in September, due to dwindling supplies, the Food Security Sector reports.\n\nOnly four out of 37 olive presses remain functional throughout the Strip and more than one million olive trees have been uprooted since October 2023, according to the Food Security Sector.\n\nClose to 100 per cent of Gaza\u2019s population now live in poverty, compared with 64 per cent before the onset of escalated hostilities, according to the World Bank.\n\nHumanitarian Developments\n\nIsraeli bombardment from the air, land and sea continues to be reported across the Gaza Strip, resulting in further civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of civilian infrastructure. Ground operations, particularly in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, south of Gaza city, in and around An Nuseirat refugee camp in Deir al Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah also continue to be reported.\n\nBetween the afternoons of 26 and 30 September, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, 81 Palestinians were killed and 267 were injured. Between 7 October 2023 and 30 September 2024, at least 41,615 Palestinians were killed and 96,359 were injured, according to MoH in Gaza.\n\nThe following are some of the deadly incidents reported between 26 and 29 September: On 26 September, two children and their parents were reportedly killed and others injured, when a house was hit in Jabalya, in North Gaza.\n\nOn 26 September, three Palestinian men were reportedly killed and others injured, when a house was hit in An Nuseirat refugee camp, in Deir al Balah.\n\nOn 27 September, four Palestinian men were reportedly killed and others injured, when they were hit in An Nuseirat New camp, in Deir al Balah.\n\nOn 27 September, at least three Palestinians, including one woman, were reportedly killed and four others injured, when a house was hit in Al Mawasi area, in western Rafah.\n---\nOn 27 September, at least two children and their parents were reportedly killed and others injured, when a house was hit in An Naser area, in northern Rafah.\n\nOn 29 September, three Palestinian men were reportedly killed and six others injured, when a house was hit near Ash Shabia area in Ad Daraj neighbourhood, in Gaza city.\n\nBetween the afternoons of 27 and 30 September, no Israeli soldiers were reportedly killed in Gaza, according to the Israeli military. Between 7 October 2023 and 30 September 2024, according to the Israeli military and official Israeli sources cited in the media, more than 1,546 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, the majority on 7 October and its immediate aftermath. The figure includes 346 soldiers killed in Gaza or along the border in Israel since the beginning of the ground operation. In addition, 2,298 Israeli soldiers were reported injured since the beginning of the ground operation.\n\nAs the rainy season approaches, the already dire living conditions in Gaza will deteriorate further, putting hundreds of thousands of people at heightened risk of additional displacement, asset loss, health hazards, and limited access to essential services. The UN and its humanitarian partners have developed a Winterization Plan, which aims to address the critical needs of over 2.1 million people in Gaza during the winter months, including more than 850,000 people across 49 neighbourhoods living in flood-prone areas. The plan, which is a subset of the Flash Appeal for the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), requires US$242 million to implement a wide array of urgent interventions, with a particular focus on vulnerable groups including female-headed households, children, persons at risk of violence including gender-based violence, the elderly, disabled and chronically ill people. These include, among other things: enhancing conditions in shelters to protect people from the cold and flooding; distributing warm clothing, blankets, tarpaulins, heating materials to displaced households; installing temporary drainage systems to redirect floodwaters away from critical infrastructure, including dumping sites; and establishing winter-proof baby-friendly tents for breastfeeding and provision of nutrition services. However, the implementation of planned interventions cannot happen in the absence of unimpeded entry of required humanitarian items into Gaza, the availability of adequate quantities of fuel and facilitation of safe humanitarian movement between warehouses and distribution points. The ongoing challenges faced by humanitarian actors in accessing northern Gaza are particularly concerning, as some parts, historically, have a high potential for flooding.\n\nThe ongoing crisis in Gaza will set children\u2019s education \u201cback by up to five years and risks creating a lost generation of permanently traumatized Palestinian youth,\u201d according to a new study by the University of Cambridge, the Centre for Lebanese Studies and UNRWA. The report, the first to comprehensively quantify the toll of the crisis on learning, lays out three different scenarios for Gaza\u2019s younger generation, depending on when the crisis ends and how promptly the education system is restored. The most optimistic projection \u2013 assuming an immediate ceasefire and rapid efforts to rebuild the education system \u2013 is that students will have lost competencies equivalent to two or three years of schooling. Beyond the ongoing crisis which has now lasted for over 11 months, this calculation also factors in the impact of COVID-19 and of the previous escalation of hostilities in May 2021. If formal classes do not resume until 2026, the losses could stretch for up to five years. This does not account for the additional impacts of trauma, malnutrition and forced displacement, which are further eroding children\u2019s physical, cognitive and emotional wellbeing.\n\nThe Education Cluster warns that many of the 215 established temporary learning spaces (TLSs), which serve nearly 34,000 children, now risk being severely affected by upcoming floodings. Geospatial analysis by the cluster reveals that eight TLSs are directly located within flood-prone areas, another 24 TLSs benefiting nearly 5,800 students are less than 100 metres away from such areas, and an additional 14 TLSs serving almost 3,000 students are near the coastline. With the destruction of essential drainage infrastructure due to the ongoing hostilities, expected heavy rains can cause significant damage and force the suspension of informal learning in these sites. The cluster stresses that ongoing restrictions by the Israeli authorities on the entry of educational materials and prefabricated structures, logistical and movement challenges for cluster partners, as well as severe overcrowding in sites hosting internally displaced persons, all risk hindering the implementation of urgent risk mitigation measures. The cluster also faces severe resource limitations preventing investments in infrastructural improvements.\n\nThe ability of humanitarian partners to provide food assistance is increasingly shrinking across the Strip. The Food Security Sector (FSS) reports that, in September, due to continuous food supply shortages, more than 1.4 million people did not receive their monthly food rations across Gaza. Meanwhile, due to insecurity, damaged roads, the breakdown of law and order and access limitations along the main humanitarian route between the Kerem Shalom Crossing, Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, as well as the suspension of humanitarian aid entries to northern Gaza via the Jordan Corridor since the security incident of 8 September, at least 100,000 metric tons of food commodities, equivalent to two months of food parcels for the whole population, await entry outside the Strip; these goods must urgently be brought in to prevent further interruptions in life-saving distribution. FSS partners also continue to face challenges in keeping kitchens and bakeries operational; as of the third week of September, about 600,000 cooked meals prepared in more than 150 kitchens were provided daily to families across the Strip, but this level of meal production is expected to decrease in October due to dwindling supplies. Moreover, while 14 bakeries supported by humanitarian partners are presently operational, the continued functionality of the six bakeries in northern Gaza is contingent on securing yeast or shifting to the production of yeast-free bread. In its latest analysis concerning August, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) indicated that humanitarian assistance is only partially mitigating the severity of acute food insecurity and people are expected to continue enduring \u201clarge to extreme food consumption deficits, malnourishment, and hunger-related mortality\u201d until \u201csafe, consistent humanitarian access\u201d facilitates both an increase in the quantity of aid delivered and effective distribution to people in need.\n\nThe agricultural sector continues to suffer from increasing damage. FSS reports that recent military operations in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, have led to the additional destruction of more than 50 dunums (five hectares) of agriculture land and agriculture assets, including fields planted with eggplants, oranges, peppers and other vegetables owned by at least ten farmers. The latest satellite imagery collected in September 2024 shows that approximately 68 per cent (102 square kilometres) of permanent crop fields in Gaza exhibit a significant decline in health and density, compared with the average of the previous seven years. FSS warns\n---\nthat, while the olive harvest season has started in the Strip, there is a sharp decrease in olive production due to mass destruction of olive orchards, with more than one million olive trees uprooted since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023. Only four out of 37 olive presses remain functional throughout the Strip, but challenging access to fuel represents a key obstacle hampering the use of even this remaining equipment.\n\nThe fishing sector, which used to be a primary source of livelihoods in Gaza, has similarly not been spared by the impact of nearly 12 months of escalated hostilities. According to a recent report by the Palestinian NGO Network (PNGO), since October 2023, 150 fishermen have died and 87 per cent of fishing boats have been damaged or destroyed, including 96 motorized boats and 900 unmotorized ones. Gaza\u2019s port and other key fishing infrastructure have also been reportedly destroyed, with indirect losses estimated by PNGO at about $7 million per month. This, compounded by ongoing fishing restrictions, lack of equipment and fuel, is resulting in thousands of fishermen losing their livelihoods, stresses PNGO.\n\nThe Palestinian economy is \u201cnearing economic freefall, amidst a historic humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip\u201d according to a report by the World Bank published on 23 September. Gaza\u2019s economy has contracted by 86 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, with the overall GDP in the OPT declining by 35 per cent, \u201cmarking its largest economic contraction on record.\u201d The report further highlights that the halt of most commercial operations and disruption of supply chains have caused the price of basic commodities to surge to about 250 per cent in August 2024 compared with August 2023. Moreover, severe damage to the agri- food economy has compounded the humanitarian crisis and devastated livelihoods; prior to 2020, 13 per cent of Gaza\u2019s workforce were employed in the agricultural sector that also offered informal employment to over 90 percent of the population. Gaza\u2019s sinking economy has led the World Bank to assess that close to 100 per cent of Gaza\u2019s population now live in poverty, compared with 64 per cent before the onset of escalated hostilities.\n\nFunding\n\nAs of 30 September, Member States have disbursed about $1.68 billion out of the $3.42 billion (49 per cent) requested to meet the most critical needs of 2.3 million* people in Gaza and 800,000 people in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between January and December 2024. For funding analysis, please see the Flash Appeal Financial Tracking dashboard. (*2.3 million reflects the projected population of the Gaza Strip upon issuance of the Flash Appeal in April 2024. As of July 2024, the UN estimates that about 2.1 million people remain in the Gaza Strip, and this updated number is now used for programmatic purposes.)\n\nDuring August 2024, the occupied Palestinian territory Humanitarian Fund (oPt HF) managed 93 ongoing projects, totalling $79.7 million. These projects aimed to address urgent needs in the Gaza Strip (89 per cent) and the West Bank (11 per cent). They were strategically focused on education, food security, health, protection, emergency shelter and non-food items, water, sanitation, and hygiene, coordination and support services, multi-purpose cash assistance and nutrition. Of these projects, 52 projects are being implemented by international non-governmental organizations, 29 by national NGOs and 12 by UN agencies. Notably, 32 out of the 64 projects implemented by INGOs or the UN are being implemented in collaboration with national NGOs. Monthly updates, annual reports, and a list of all funded projects per year, are available on the oPt Humanitarian Fund webpage, under the financing section.",

        "content": "title: PALESTINE One year of hostilities: impact on education in Gaza \n content: PALESTINE One year of hostilities: impact on education in Gaza\n\nThematic report 04 October 2024\n\nAbout this report\n\nAim: this report aims to highlight the hostilities\u2019 impacts on education in Gaza and the main challenges facing the education system. It will also highlight the secondary impacts of the prolonged lack of education on Gazan students.\n\nMethodology: the analysis is based on the secondary data review of public and nonpublic sources, corroborated by conversations with key stakeholders.\n\nLimitations: most secondary data highlights the situation of school-age children in Gaza more than higher education students. This is because the mandate of the Education Cluster within the humanitarian response system is to focus on mandatory basic schooling (grades one to ten).\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOne year after the Israel\u2013Gaza conflict began, Gaza continues to face devastating effects, with unprecedented loss of life and widespread infrastructure destruction. By 24 September, the hostilities had killed more than 41,495 people and injured 96,006 in Gaza, and an estimated 1.9 million people have been internally displaced (90% of the population) (OCHA 25/09/2024). As of 9 September, around 86% of Gaza remained under Israeli-issued evacuation orders.\n\nThe impact of the hostilities has disproportionately affected civilians, especially children. As millions of students around the world start a new academic year, students in Gaza are still grappling with the conflict\u2019s impacts, including severe disruptions to their education (AJ 04/09/2024; EAA 13/03/2024). Since 7 October 2023, all schools, universities, and training centres in Gaza have remained closed, and displacement, facility destruction, and access constraints from Israeli military operations have left Gazans without education access (Al Mezan 02/09/2024).\n\nFatalities by 24 September 2024 included at least 10,310 students and 410 school teachers (OCHA 25/09/2024). Injuries by 24 September included over 19,110 students and 2,460 school teachers (OCHA 25/09/2024). The hostilities had displaced at least 19,000 students within Gaza by 9 September (MoE X 09/09/2024).\n\nAny comments or questions? Please contact us at info@acaps.org\n\nFatalities by 26 September included more than 650 university students and 110 educators (TNH 26/09/2024).\n\nThe figures of deaths, injuries, and displacement are likely much higher than reported, as insecurity and access constraints, including infrastructure destruction, challenge data collection and reporting mechanisms.\n\nMore than 625,000 school-age children in Gaza have gone a full year without formal education (Reuters 21/08/2024).\n\nAn estimated 58,000 children were unable to start first grade for the 2024 academic year (UNICEF 09/09/2024; MoE X 09/09/2024).\n\nBy May, all 12 of Gaza\u2019s higher education institutions had been destroyed or damaged, grinding all services to a halt and affecting 90,000 higher education students (Reuters 13/05/2024).\n\nAn August UNICEF report estimated that almost all Gazan children (more than one million) needed mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) (UNICEF 08/08/2024).\n\nAn estimated 17,000 children were unaccompanied or separated by February, and 4,000 children were missing or buried under rubble by June (UNICEF 02/02/2024; STC 24/06/2024). Hostilities and data collection challenges mean that these numbers were likely higher by September 2024.\n\nInternational humanitarian law grants schools general protection against direct attacks, and attacks on schools are one of six grave violations against children in armed conflict contexts as identified by the UNSC (ECW 02/04/2024; SRSG/CAAC accessed 24/09/2024). By 30 March, however, attacks had directly hit or damaged at least 88% of school buildings (477 out of 564) since 7 October 2023 (OCHA 25/09/2024; ECW 02/04/2024; Education Cluster 12/09/2024 and 28/07/2024; UNICEF accessed 24/09/2024). These numbers are based on confirmed damages, which means the figure could be as high as 93% if including likely damaged schools (Education Cluster et al. 10/09/2024). Between November 2023 and July 2024, direct attacks by Israeli armed forces against schools \u2013 60% of which are serving as displacement shelters \u2013 have trended upward, with 378 directly hit by September 2024 (UNICEF accessed 24/09/2024; Education Cluster 01/10/2024). Direct attacks on schools have continued, with ten schools hit from 1\u201323 September (OHCHR 23/09/2024; AJ 21/09/2024). Many schools that were classified as \u201cdamaged\u201d in the July analysis from the Education Cluster had been struck again and were classified as \u201cdirect hit\u201d by September 2024 (Education Cluster 01/10/2024). The UN, along with independent experts, have accused Israel of the \u201csystematic obliteration\u201d of the Palestinian education system (UN 18/04/2024).\n---\nKEY MESSAGES\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unprecedented. As a result, fundamental aspects of childhood have been destroyed, including loss of family and support systems and no opportunities for children to learn, play, or keep a stable routine (KIT 12/09/2024).\n\nBarely any education infrastructure is left in Gaza. The few remaining schools are serving as shelters for displaced people (CNN 15/09/2024).\n\nChildren are using time typically spent learning to queue for food and water assistance (CNN 15/09/2024).\n\nIsraeli authorities do not consider learning materials humanitarian items and often do not allow their entry into Gaza through border crossings. There is limited to no stationery or other learning supplies available in local markets, and any remaining supplies have become too expensive for people to afford.\n\nSustainable education programming and learning outcomes are not possible until there is a lasting ceasefire (UNRWA 25/09/2024; University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024). Under the constant threat of attack, parents are afraid to send their children for learning activities in dedicated spaces at displacement sites.\n\nHumanitarian architecture typically does not prioritise education at the onset of a crisis, even though a lack of learning opportunities for children contributes to other needs, such as for MHPSS and protection (University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024).\n\nThe longer children are out of school, the more at risk they are of permanently dropping out and engaging in child labour or early marriage (UN 10/07/2024).\n\nThe protracted lack of education typically results in high unemployment rates, which will have a long-term impact on life in Gaza. Prior to October 2023, 70% of young graduates in Gaza were unemployed. This rate was already among the highest globally (AJ 27/09/2023).\n\nThematic report | 04 October 2024\n\nEDUCATION IN GAZA PRIOR TO 7 OCTOBER 2023 Basic and secondary education\n\nThe new school year was scheduled to start on 9 September 2024, but more than 625,000 Since the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education has managed the education system in Palestine. The mandatory Palestinian education system includes government schools, private schools, and UNRWA schools.\n\nBefore 7 October 2023, the basic and secondary (kindergarten to grade 12) education system in Gaza accommodated 625,000 students and 22,564 teachers in 815 schools across 564 buildings (Anera 28/03/2024). In Palestine, grades one to ten are considered basic education and compulsory for all students (UNICEF 10/2022).\n\nDespite Gaza having high literacy and basic education completion rates, the 16-year Israeli blockade and recurring hostilities have severely weakened the education system, limiting the availability of educational materials, causing extensive facility damage, intermittently disrupting the learning process, and affecting the wellbeing of both students and teachers (UNICEF 10/2022). According to the 2023 Humanitarian Needs Overview, nearly 392,700 students needed education assistance across the Gaza Strip prior to 7 October, with Gaza city having the highest number of students in need at 139,958 (OCHA 25/01/2023).\n\nLong-term school closures because of COVID-19 had left 79% of students needing catch- up learning programmes by January 2023 (OCHA 25/01/2023). The loss of learning during COVID-19 lockdowns added pressure on the education system, meaning that students already needed humanitarian education support prior to October 2023. Between 2019\u20132024, children in Gaza lost at least 14 months of education because of COVID-19 and pre- and post- October 2023 Israeli military operations (University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024).\n\nHigher education\n\nPrior to 7 October 2023, roughly 90,000 students were enrolled across 12 universities in Gaza (Reuters 13/05/2024). Despite the challenges of the 16-year Israeli blockade and a lack of employment opportunities, Gazans strive to pursue higher education and perceive it as a means of mobility and financial security, as well as a point of societal pride (Jebril 23/08/2024; TNH 26/09/2024). The increasing impact of the blockade on Gaza\u2019s economy and security, however, has made access to higher education difficult, particularly for lower-income families who cannot afford to send their children to universities.\n---\nIMPACTS OF THE CONFLICT ON EDUCATION IN GAZA SINCE 7 OCTOBER 2023\n\nImpeded access to primary, secondary, and higher education\n\nThe new school year was scheduled to start on 9 September 2024. Unable to return to their primary and secondary schools, more than 625,000 children in Gaza have been without education since 7 October 2023 (Reuters 21/08/2024). An additional 58,000 six-year-olds were unable to start first grade for the current academic year (MoE X 09/09/2024; Reuters 09/09/2024; UNICEF 09/09/2024).\n\nFurthermore, in July 2024, 39,000 students in Gaza could not sit for their grade 12 official exams (Tawjihi) (UNICEF 09/09/2024). This, combined with the destruction of all higher education facilities in Gaza, means that these students are unable to progress to higher education, and a significant portion may never return to school (DCIP 26/06/2024; Education Cluster 03/08/2024). This will severely limit their career opportunities and employability. These consequences extend beyond individuals, where a lack of an educated workforce can further stifle economic growth and perpetuate cycles of poverty and its impacts on households.\n\nFigures of students unable to attend school this year (a total of 659,000) are calculated using baseline information, and unfortunately do not consider students who were killed and those who were able to leave Gaza in the early days of the hostilities.\n\nAll 12 of Gaza\u2019s higher education institutions have been destroyed or damaged since 7 October, grinding all services to a halt and affecting 90,000 higher education students. In some cases, universities in the West Bank are supporting students, though internet and communication challenges to distance learning and displacement limit this support (Reuters 13/05/2024). Medical students unable to continue their higher education have been volunteering at the front lines to support Gaza\u2019s medical system, as healthcare provision is overstretched and under attack by Israeli armed forces (TNH 26/09/2024).\n\nThe loss of at least 14 months of education because of COVID-19 and pre- and post-October 2023 Israeli military operations in Gaza has resulted in roughly 20% of children lacking basic reading skills by age ten (University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024). The figure is likely higher, as the methodology used to calculate the \u2018learning poverty\u2019 rate did not account for the greater impacts of the hostilities on education.\n\nThematic report | 04 October 2024\n\nHostilities\u2019 impacts on teachers\n\nThe hostilities have mentally and physically affected teachers and educators in Gaza, with many having experienced displacement and the loss of loved ones. By 24 September, 410 education staff had been killed and 2,460 were injured in Gaza (OCHA 25/09/2024).\n\nMany teachers are also likely to be involved in frontline activities, such as supporting the recovery of bodies from attack sites. Despite the passion and commitment of academic staff and teachers to contribute to children\u2019s learning opportunities, the context of Gaza and its stressors have affected their ability to engage meaningfully with learning activities, and students and are likely to face long-lasting impacts (University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024).\n\nDamage or destruction of educational infrastructure\n\nGazan educational infrastructure \u2013 including schools, colleges, and universities \u2013 have been severely bombarded, with at least 93% of school buildings either damaged or destroyed by 10 September (Education Cluster et al. 10/09/2024). 85% of schools require significant repair or reconstruction before being functional again (UNICEF 09/09/2024; Education Cluster et al. 10/09/2024). According to a July 2024 satellite analysis by the Education Cluster, the hardest- hit governorate was North Gaza, with 98% of its school buildings either directly struck or damaged (where damage occurred within school premises but not directly on a building). Gaza governorate was similarly affected, with 93% of its school buildings affected, while 72% of school buildings in Khan Younis governorate sustained direct hits (Education Cluster 28/07/2024).\n\nThe damage or destruction of a single school often disrupts the education of two cohorts of students, since 61% schools in Gaza use a double-shift system. This system assigns separate morning and afternoon groups sharing facilities because of already limited education infrastructure and a high population density (Anera 28/03/2024; Education Cluster 28/07/2024; The Guardian 18/12/2023). 70% of UNRWA schools and all private schools operated on a double- shift system (Education Cluster 01/10/2024).\n\nUnaffected schools are serving as temporary shelters for displaced people. Because of fuel and gas shortages, displaced people have resorted to using school equipment, including desks and books, as fuel to make fires. This will likely increase the burden of reconstruction and rehabilitation in case of a sustained ceasefire (The Guardian 18/12/2023).\n\nAccording to educators and aid organisations, the restoration of normalcy in Gaza will be a lengthy process because of the extensive damage inflicted, even with a long-term ceasefire (The Guardian 18/12/2023).\n---\nPrior to 7 October 2023, Israel already restricted the entry of dual-use items \u2013 civilian items that could have military uses, such as many construction materials \u2013 into Gaza. This impeded the repair and rehabilitation of infrastructure affected by the recurrent escalation of hostilities, and necessary reconstruction efforts for affected infrastructure, including schools, were often left incomplete (OCHA 25/01/2023; Reach Education Fund 14/01/2022). These restrictions, which are still in place, are likely to greatly impede the repairs of infrastructure destroyed since 7 October.\n\nFor further information on restrictions on dual-use items, please read the ACAPS analysis on the political economy of Gaza.\n\nThe current level of infrastructure damage and destruction compounds existing infrastructure damage from even before 7 October. Israeli attacks on schools are frequent in Palestine, with the use of both air-launched and ground-launched explosive weapons a common occurrence during outbreaks of conflict (UNICEF 10/08/2019). Between January\u2013June 2023, the Education Cluster documented 423 education-related incidents, defined as \u201cany threatened or actual use of force against students, teachers, academics, education support and transport staff, education officials, education buildings, resources, or facilities (including school buses) perpetrated by armed forces, law enforcement, state security entities, and non-state armed groups\u201d (OCHA/UN RC/HC oPt 21/08/2023; GCPEA/Education Cluster 17/04/2022). These incidents affected around 50,000 children across Palestine, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem (OCHA/UN RC/HC oPt 21/08/2023; Education Cluster 05/09/2023; Reuters 07/10/2023). The number of education-related incidents in 2023 for Gaza alone is not publicly available.\n\nFurther reduced access to schools for children with disabilities\n\nSince 7 October 2023, educational barriers for children with disabilities have only increased. The number of children with disabilities has likely risen in Gaza considering the level of conflict-related injuries, with more than 1,000 children estimated to have had one or both legs amputated (KIT 12/09/2024). Access to learning activities is expected to be even more constrained, as children are unable to move freely through damaged and destroyed infrastructure and terrain. Prior to 7 October, poor school infrastructure from years of hostilities had already made access to education particularly difficult for children with disabilities, who represented 2% of the student population (OCHA 25/01/2023).\n\nThematic report | 04 October 2024\n\nVastly reduced sense of safety for children accessing available learning activities\n\nBy 9 September 2024, Israel had issued new evacuation orders for people sheltering in North Gaza to leave their homes (Reuters 09/09/2024). People in Gaza have received multiple evacuation orders in different areas of the enclave since 7 October 2023, with the majority of the population experiencing repeated displacement. The experience of repeated displacement has significantly increased emotional distress in children, affecting their sense of safety (KIT 12/09/2024). Related stressors can be expected to affect many children\u2019s ability to learn.\n\nAs a result of repeated displacement and the constant risk of attacks on shelters, there is a lack of safe spaces for education responders to establish temporary learning hubs for children (UNICEF 09/09/2024; KIT 12/09/2024). Given the frequency of attacks on Gaza, caregivers are also afraid to send their children to any learning activities being provided.\n\nUN mine action experts have warned that even when the current hostilities end, the risk from unexploded weapons remains lethally high for civilians in Gaza (UN 06/05/2024; Arab Center DC 17/07/2024). The extensive use of bombs since 7 October has increased civilians\u2019 risk of death and injury from explosive remnants of war (ERW). Because of their curious inclinations, children are particularly exposed to fatality risks from ERW. ERW presence had already affected school-age children before 7 October. Between May 2021 and December 2022, children made up 79% of reported ERW victims (OCHA 25/01/2023). From 2014\u20132021, UNMAS removed nearly 8,800 ERW in Gaza, with unexploded ordnance also discovered near schools (GCPEA/Education Cluster 17/04/2022; HI 14/02/2023).\n\nDestruction and shortage of education materials\n\nThere is a severe shortage of equipment and teaching materials in Gaza, as some have been destroyed alongside schools, while others have been repurposed to create fires for displaced people seeking shelter in abandoned facilities (The Guardian 18/12/2023). Little to no learning supplies are left in the local markets, and the prices of any existing materials have soared. The Israeli authorities do not consider educational and recreational supplies humanitarian items, impeding the delivery of new learning supplies in humanitarian convoys coming into Gaza through Israeli checkpoints.\n---\nSECONDARY IMPACTS OF PROLONGED LACK OF ACCESS TO LEARNING\n\nThe disruption to education, including previous educational losses from COVID-19 and past conflicts, will have long-lasting consequences for Gazan students\u2019 futures, adding to the trauma and loss that the hostilities have already inflicted.\n\nIncreased exposure to protection risks\n\nIn the absence of learning opportunities, children are supporting their families by generating income or seeking assistance, including queuing for food and water assistance (CNN 15/09/2024). Doing so during the bombardment of Gaza exposes children to the risk of death, injury, or separation from their caregivers.\n\nThe loss of access to schools, which serves as a protective environment, has increased children\u2019s exposure to exploitation and consequent trauma, endangering their physical and mental wellbeing. The longer children are out of school, the more difficult it becomes for them to catch up on their education, and the more likely it is for them to face the risk of exploitation, including child labour and child marriage (UN 10/07/2024).\n\nPrior to October 2023, economic strains on households resulted in 7% of children in Gaza engaging in child labour, with a rate of 12% in North Gaza (UNICEF 20/04/2021). The majority of households with children engaged in labour live below the poverty line, cannot afford education, and require additional support for household income (OCHA 14/05/2019). The Israeli hostilities since October 2023 have aggravated the economic burden on households, which could lead to a higher incidence of children engaging in labour for survival (University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024).\n\nSchools typically act as important entry points for child protection systems, where teachers notice students who do not seem mentally or physically healthy. Typically, teachers would support these students and refer those who did not know where to seek support to child protection services. The loss of schools and the hostilities\u2019 impacts on teachers\u2019 mental and physical wellbeing mean that students have lost access to a vital protection system.\n\nHeightened MHPSS needs\n\nThe current lack of schooling puts young children at risk of developmental delays and damage to their cognitive, social, and emotional development (UNICEF 09/09/2024). With almost all of Gaza\u2019s children (1.2 million) suffering mental distress, there is a critical need for education to resume, with the inclusion of trauma-informed psychosocial support in future school\n\nThematic report | 04 October 2024\n\ncurriculums to support children\u2019s recovery (The Guardian 18/12/2023; UiT/NRC 18/07/2024). For older students, the disruption to their academics has contributed to increased uncertainty and anxiety (UNICEF 09/09/2024). Continual shock and trauma have affected students\u2019 outlook on the future and the world, with children questioning the values of equality, tolerance, and human rights when taught about them in school (University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024). The longer the hostilities last and children face extreme stressors, the more challenging it will be for them to recover and live physically and mentally healthy lives (KIT 12/09/2024).\n\nPrior to 7 October 2023, children were already facing psychosocial distress because of recurrent hostilities, but according to the 2023 Humanitarian Needs Overview, the provision of school-based psychosocial support was already a challenge even then (OCHA 25/01/2023).\n\nFor further information on the pre- and post-7 October MHPSS drivers and needs of people in Gaza, please read the ACAPS analysis on the impact of the conflict on MHPSS needs in Gaza.\n\nIncreased vulnerability to food insecurity and malnutrition\n\nCurrently, there is no data available on the nutritional status of children above five years old. The lack of schooling affects students\u2019 access to food, which can be expected to deteriorate their nutritional status. The disruption of school feeding programmes since 7 October 2023 has also left millions of children without consistent access to nutritious meals (Buheji/Buheji 23/01/2024; WFP 02/08/2024).\n\nCombined with protection risks that are likely to occur in the absence of education, such as early marriage, gender-based violence, and adolescent pregnancies, students are expected to experience long-term negative nutritional outcomes and increased gender disparities (Vahedi et al. 16/02/2023).\n\nPoor nutritional status will also have long-term consequences on education, as it affects children\u2019s cognitive and physical development, and they can be expected to need extra support for learning in the future (University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024; Roberts et al. 26/01/2022).\n\nPlease read the ACAPS analysis on the impact of hostilities on children in Gaza for further information on other needs that children uniquely experience, including malnutrition.\n---\nIncreased long-term adolescent unemployment rates\n\nDelayed or absent education worsens the long-term socioeconomic impacts of the hostilities in Gaza, where students are likely to face increased unemployment and lower economic growth (University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024). Prior to October 2023, youth unemployment in Gaza was already among the highest in the world at 70%. In September 2023, an estimated 200,000 graduates ages 19\u201329 were unemployed (AJ 27/09/2023).\n\nEDUCATION RESPONSE CAPACITY\n\nEducation continues to be underfunded in humanitarian appeals, with at least a 78.2% funding gap for education programming by 15 September 2024 and an UNRWA analysis finding only 3.5% of aid benefitting education in Gaza (Education Cluster accessed 24/09/2024; University of Cambridge et al. 25/09/2024).\n\nCurrently, all education-related humanitarian programming is labelled \u2018learning activities\u2019, as it does not meet the needs for basic education. Despite 60 humanitarian responders providing educational programming in Gaza, recreational activities and psychosocial support have been the main educational programming available. Humanitarian organisations have established temporary learning centres and programmes; by 9 September, UNICEF and other responders had established 39 temporary learning spaces offering recreational activities, emergency learning kits, and MHPSS services to more than 12,400 students, youth, caregivers, and teachers in Gaza (UNICEF 09/09/2024; Anera 28/03/2024). In August, to support children\u2019s mental health and psychosocial needs, UNRWA established a back-to-learning programme designed to provide games, drama, arts, music, and sports activities for children across 45 shelters (Reuters 09/09/2024).\n\nSignificant gaps remain in the provision of recreational materials and MHPSS kits, the establishment of temporary learning spaces and learning support sessions, and the provision of support for distance learning. These gaps are a result of insecurity, a lack of funding, the low availability of educational materials, and a lack of access to safe spaces to deliver learning activities. Insecurity-related physical impediments, as well as bureaucratic impediments \u2013 such as Israeli restrictions on dual-use items entering Gaza and learning supplies not being considered humanitarian items \u2013 are responsible for these barriers.\n\nOn 5 September, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education introduced an e-learning programme intended to enrol students in Gaza. A lack of electricity, internet connectivity, and digital devices is likely to limit its coverage. The displacement of approximately 85% of the population, the destruction of essential infrastructure, and the use of schools as shelters only worsen the situation (MEMO 06/09/2024).\n\nThematic report | 04 October 2024",

        "content": "title: Gaza humanitarian response update | 16-29 September 2024 \n content: The information below is provided every other week by Clusters and select technical working groups operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). For an overview of priority needs and activities by cluster, please see the Flash Appeal.\nHealth\nResponse\n- During the reporting period, 56 Health Cluster partners were active in Gaza, with 48 operating health service points, reaching about 300,000 people per week.\n- As of 29 September, there were 15 emergency medical teams (EMTs) supporting the local health-care workforce, including three in northern Gaza.\n- As part of a new national EMT project launched by WHO in northern Gaza, 240 national EMT doctors have been deployed to the Emergency Department of the Al-Shifa Hospital to provide both trauma and non-trauma related health services.\n- Preparations are underway for the second round of the polio vaccination campaign, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October and will include the distribution of Vitamin A supplements.\n- In the northern governorates, health partners have distributed 2,700 postpartum kits (PPK) to health facilities and shared guidance outlining distribution criteria and use modalities with relevant health workers.\n- A blood donation campaign was conducted in the West Bank during the last week of September to collect blood units for patients in Gaza, including those suffering from Thalassemia. A total of 3,000 blood units were collected and were delivered to health facilities in both northern and southern Gaza on 30 September.\n- On 29 September, eight patients, including seven children, were evacuated from Gaza for specialized medical care in Romania. They traveled along with 24 companions. Half of the patients have cancer, two have blood disease, one needs a kidney transplant, and one has a severe injury. On six occasions, 229 patients along with 316 companions have been exceptionally evacuated since the closure of Rafah Crossing on 7 May.\nChallenges\n- Health facilities continue to face severe supply shortages due to obstacles hindering the entry of humanitarian aid and a growing backlog of health supplies and equipment awaiting entry into Gaza. In particular, partners continue to face major security and access constraints in reaching medical facilities in northern Gaza, which is also impeding fuel deliveries and forcing all healthcare facilities in the north to ration fuel supplies and interrupt some services.\n- The lack of a systematic mechanism for the medical evacuation of critically ill and injured patients out of Gaza results in an ever-growing waiting list. As of 30 September, it is estimated that 12,000 patients need medical evacuation, as the clinical conditions of many deteriorate.\n- Overcrowding in displacement sites, poor water, hygiene and sanitation conditions, and the lack of essential items are contributing to growing reproductive health risks and increasing vulnerability to gender-based violence (GBV) and exploitation.\n- There are growing public health concerns for the anticipated deterioration of living conditions during the winter season in displacement sites, particularly in flood-prone areas. In a joint assessment published on 25 September, the Health and WASH Clusters warned that many IDP sites are assessed to be located in or near flooding hotspots and additional locations are vulnerable to flooding at present.\nNutrition\nResponse\n- The Cluster has trained 17 analysts for the upcoming Integrated Phase Classification for acute malnutrition (IPC-AMN) exercise, with the support of the IPC Global Support Unit. The Cluster has also benefited from the support of the SMART Initiative to analyze more than 40,000 Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) screening data collected by Nutrition Cluster partners between mid-August and mid-September, to better understand the malnutrition situation in each governorate.\n- In September, 24,281 children were screened for malnutrition. Since mid-January, a total of 318,603 children aged 6-59 months have been screened for malnutrition, including 70,329 in the northern governorates. Of all screened children, 21,638 have been diagnosed with acute malnutrition, including 16,872 with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and 4,766 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM); of those with SAM, 145 had medical complications. Treatment is provided at four stabilization centres and 102 outpatient programme sites across the Strip.\n- In September, 49,647 children under the age of five and 18,339 pregnant or breastfeeding women (PBW) received supplementary feeding, either through lipid-based nutrient supplements (LBNS) or high energy biscuits (HEB). Nutrition partners also provided 35,366 caregivers with counselling for breastfeeding and for adapted complementary feeding of children aged six months and older.\nChallenges\n- Transport and adequate storage of nutrition supplies is challenging because of the limited entry of humanitarian supplies, limited ability to store products that require refrigeration such as ready-to-use infant formula, and the loss of access to some warehouses due to ongoing hostilities, evacuation orders, access, and logistical constraints.\n- Continuous displacement is disrupting distribution, service delivery, and case monitoring, especially among children, and access to nutrition sites. Coordinating nutrition support for newly displaced people arriving at shelters is increasingly complex.\nFood Security\nResponse\n- As. of the third week of September, about 600,000 cooked meals prepared in more than 150 kitchens were provided daily to families across the Strip. However, this level of meal production is expected to decrease in October due to dwindling supplies. Overall, in September, due to continuous food supply shortages, more than 1.4 million people did not receive their monthly food rations across Gaza and in the central and southern governorates partners are providing only one food parcel per family per month, compared with two parcels per family in the north.\n- As of 29 September, 14 bakeries supported by humanitarian partners were operational in the Gaza Strip \u2013 one in Khan Younis, seven in Deir al Balah, four in Gaza city and two in Jabalya. Partners are endeavoring to urgently provide more fuel to these facilities. Five bakeries in Rafah remain closed due to ongoing hostilities and access constraints. Critically, the continued functionality of the six bakeries in northern Gaza is contingent on securing yeast or shifting to the production of yeast-free bread.\n- Following recent inter-cluster rapid assessments, partners are now mobilizing to reach communities in areas such as eastern Khan Younis that were previously inaccessible by humanitarian actors, to provide food parcels and cooked meals, particularly to the most vulnerable groups.\nChallenges\n- Humanitarian food supplies are incredibly limited across the Strip. In southern and central Gaza, FSS partners lack sufficient food stocks to meet requirements and have scaled down distribution significantly for the third consecutive month since July, with food supply shortages expected to continue in October. In northern Gaza, cargo movement was temporarily suspended via the Jordan corridor following a security incident at Allenby Bridge on 8 September, affecting partners\u2019 supply flows. As of 29 September, at least 100,000 metric tons of food commodities, equivalent to two months of food rations for the whole population, await entry outside the Strip and must be urgently brought in to ensure continuous food distribution. There are also great concerns for the increasing risk of spoilage and infestation of stranded food supplies.\n- The entry of commercial cargo continues to be limited. The Cluster continues to advocate for the delivery of commercial goods at scale across the Strip to complement humanitarian efforts, increase dietary diversity and stimulate the local economy by increasing the affordability and availability of products, as well as improving cash liquidity.\n- Recent military operations in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, have led to the additional destruction of more than 50 dunums (five hectares) of agriculture land and agriculture assets, including fields planted with eggplants, oranges, peppers and other vegetables owned by at least ten farmers. The latest satellite imagery collected by UNOSAT in September 2024 shows that approximately 68 per cent (102 square kilometres) of permanent crop fields in Gaza exhibit a significant decline in health and density, compared with the average of the previous seven years.\n- While the olive harvest season in Gaza has started, there is sharp decrease in olive production due to mass destruction of olive orchards, with more than one million olive trees uprooted since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023. Only four out of 37 olive presses remain functional throughout the Strip, but challenging access to fuel represents a key obstacle hampering the use of even this remaining equipment.\n- The significant increase in firewood prices continues to push an increasing number of people into energy poverty, exacerbated by the limited availability of gas and the ongoing electricity cuts. It is anticipated that the energy crisis will further worsen as the rainy winter season approaches. In the north, the lack of entry of cooking gas has entered its 12th consecutive month. Protracted shortages of energy sources for cooking continue to force displaced families to cook by burning wood from waste, which hinders proper food preparation and nutrition intake, exacerbates health and protection risks, and causes environmental hazards.\n- The extremely limited entry of fertilizers and other livestock and crop production inputs is a key obstacle hampering the restoration of local food production in Gaza. A dual-track approach is required to food assistance and emergency livelihood interventions. Agricultural activities, including small-scale gardening that is critical to enhance dietary diversity, remain largely suspended.\n- If physical road access, health-care provision, as well as energy, water, sanitation, hygiene, and shelter conditions are further compromised, there is a high risk that the food insecurity and malnutrition situation will worsen beyond the already alarming rates observed.\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)\nResponse\n- Between 21 to 27 September, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) and Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) reported that the average water supply for safe drinking and domestic purposes was about 116,000 cubic metres per day across the Gaza Strip, or just over a quarter of water supply provided prior to October 2023. This includes 78,600 cubic metres of water produced by municipal and UNRWA water wells.\n- Between 21 and 27 September, WASH Cluster partners received a total of 123,164 litres of fuel, or an average of 17,500 litres per day, which represents only 25 per cent of the minimum daily requirement of 70,000 litres to meet critical WASH and public health needs. This delivery marks a four per cent reduction compared to the quantity received between 14 and 21 September.\n- The WASH Cluster completed a Rapid Joint WASH Assessment across the Gaza Strip, to assess the severity of WASH needs and the most critical service gaps for displaced people, and to inform response planning.\nChallenges\n- There is an urgent need for generators, submersible pumps and other critical supplies for water wells and pumping stations as they remain largely unavailable on the local market.\n- The lack of access to soap and other basic hygiene items is severely hindering families\u2019 ability to protect themselves from communicable diseases, especially in overcrowded shelters, disproportionately affecting children, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems. Key products like shampoo, detergent, and dishwashing liquid are no longer available, making it impossible for households to maintain cleanliness, prepare food safely, or wash clothes. Health-care facilities are also struggling to maintain proper sanitation, increasing the risk of infections for patients and staff.\n- The flow of water from the main transmission line running from Israel remains at only 80 per cent of capacity, with several critical water facilities damaged and rendered inaccessible in recent weeks. Water supply through the middle and southern connection points must be urgently increased to full capacity.\nShelter and Non-Food Items (NFI)\nResponse\n- The Shelter Cluster continues to track the needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) whose shelters have been damaged by hostilities or flooded. Recently, two Cluster partners assessed a displacement site west of Al-Rasheed Street, on the Costal Road, to identify households most vulnerable to tidal impacts during the winter season and assess necessary shelter assistance.\n- Despite supply shortages, and where possible, the Cluster provides shelter support, including tents, sealing-off kits and non-food items. Between 16 and 29 September, Cluster partners distributed 620 family tents and 3,300 pieces of tarpaulin to households in need in southern Gaza. Tents and a limited quantity of sealing-off kits were also provided to households in northern Gaza.\nChallenges\n- Shelter Cluster partners continue to face challenges in importing shelter materials, which is deeply concerning as the winter season approaches. The Cluster has been forced to prioritise the bare minimum of shelter items, which would not constitute dignified shelter. This means that, even if these minimum supplies are brought in, affected households will not be adequately protected in the winter.\n- A shortage of shelter items could lead to increased health risks, potential fatalities, and even protests. In September, cluster partners received only nine trucks of shelter items via the Fence Road, which is currently the main route for these supplies. Overall, 0.9 million people across Gaza require winterization support.\n- Inclement weather will also exacerbate the risk of collapse for damaged buildings in which many families are sheltering. Without access to undertake assessments, capacity to conduct repairs, or anywhere else for families to go, the cluster is not able to practically support those in damaged buildings other than alerting them of the risks through awareness-raising messages.\nSite Management Working Group (SMWG)\nResponse\n- During the reporting period, SMWG partners monitored 38 sites hosting approximately 170,875 people in the Khan Younis, Deir al Balah, Gaza and North Gaza governorates. Identified needs and response gaps were shared with partners to guide response efforts.\n- SMWG partners have begun rapid assessments of coastal sites considered highly vulnerable to the rising tide, to inform response planning.\n- A draft analysis of empty land plots was conducted in Deir al Balah to support local authorities in identifying areas for the potential relocation of people affected by tidal rise and/or flooding, which should only be considered as a last resort. Before any preparatory work commences, the sites need to be cleared from potential unexploded ordnance by UNMAS.\nChallenges\n- SMWG partners lack sufficient human resources to carry out needed assessments at IDP sites.\n- Constant population movements caused by evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military and rapid changes in developments on the ground due to hostilities are hindering the implementation of an effective site management response.\nProtection\nResponse\n- The Protection Cluster continues to expand the pool of staff and volunteers serving as Emergency Protection Responders (EPRs), with more than 100 already trained. EPRs have been mobilized in the majority of inter-cluster assessments to support, along with Protection Cluster staff, the conduct of key informant interviews, facilitate focus group discussions at the community level, and refer protection cases as needed to specialized Protection partners or to other clusters.\n- While 12 GBV partners were able to distribute 1,900 dignity kits in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, this is far below the scale of needs, with over 800,000 dignity kits estimated to be required at present. The dramatic spike in prices and the irregular availability of hygiene supplies on the market leave many women and girls with no means to cope with this gap, with dire shortages of blankets, shoes, warm clothes and other winter items expected to soon exacerbate their suffering. The GBV sub-cluster is assessing the potential for cash assistance to address the urgent needs of women and girls, but the unavailability of cash in Gaza continues to be hinder support.\n- Jointly with the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) Technical Working Group, there are ongoing efforts to strengthen MHPSS services for women and girls at risk of GBV, including those with disabilities, and increase the capacity of GBV frontline workers to provide support and align their service provision with GBV Minimum Standards. Partners are also working with the Shelter Cluster to develop a referral protocol to mitigate the risk of exploitation of vulnerable cases.\n- The Child Protection Case Management Working Group, in cooperation with Save the Children, began conducting surveys and key informant interviews with case managers to assess needs and address gaps in the current management of child protection cases. Moreover, jointly with UNRWA, Child Protection partners began data collection to plan for winterization activities; this includes procuring psychosocial support kits and winter clothes through the private sector.\n- Mine Action partners continue to use SMS, radio, and social media to disseminate messages on explosive ordnance risk education and conflict preparedness and protection (EORE-CPP). Between 14 and 27 September, partners completed 13 explosive hazard assessments (EHAs) and took part in five inter agency missions.\n- UNRWA\u2019s protection teams continue to identify and respond to protection risks and the needs of displaced people in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, including Al Mawasi. They are visiting shelters and IDP sites, providing awareness sessions on EORE, GBV and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), undertaking focus group discussions and key informant interviews with IDPs, monitoring aid distribution, and following up on previously identified vulnerable cases. With the Education Cluster, Protection Monitors also continue to closely monitor learning activities in shelters to ensure that the safety, dignity, and wellbeing of children are prioritised, and any protection issue or concern is timely addressed.\nChallenges\n- Insecurity, the disruption of aid flows, the breakdown of law and order, and the denial or restriction on entry of critical items by the Israeli authorities continue to hinder the Protection response. These items include sanitary pads, dignity, and menstrual hygiene management kits (MHM) for women and girls, recreational materials for children and assistive devices for persons with disabilities. Minimum standard explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) equipment and EORE materials are also prevented entry by Israeli authorities into Gaza, thereby limiting the capacity of the Mine Action response.\n- IDP sites are in dire condition, amid the continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications. For example, sites visited by UNRWA protection monitors in Al Mawasi are characterized by worn out tents and tarpaulins, lack of mattresses, key NFIs, and insufficient food, water and sanitation. The approaching adverse weather conditions represent a key concern. IDPs are deeply distressed about the lack of assistance and are demanding support.\n- The shortage of tents affects the ability to expand group-based psycho-social support and provide safe spaces or temporary accommodation for unaccompanied children. The limited availability of supplies on the local market, including MHM and dignity kits, has disproportionately affected women and girls, who are at risk of GBV, and increased their vulnerability to disease. The PSS needs remain vast, and it is critical that more kits be approved for entry into the Strip.\n- While the Child Protection sub-cluster and UNICEF are endeavoring to reunify unaccompanied and separated children with their parent(s) and families, barriers include frequent denial of missions. Currently, at least 60 children have been identified by UNICEF and UNRWA who require reunification with their families.\n- Lack of funding and impeded access by Israeli authorities for specialized personnel and equipment for the clearance and disposal of deep-buried bombs (DBB) hamper people\u2019s protection from explosive remnants of war (ERW) and the safe and sustainable delivery of humanitarian aid. Mine Action stresses the need to obtain meaningful data from the Israeli authorities regarding the geographical location of ERW and hazardous areas.\n- The ongoing power cuts and limited access to communications services, coupled with fuel shortages and damage to key infrastructure, continue to curtail mobility. Insecurity, bombardments and ensuing displacement continue to constrain community outreach and protection activities, including proper case management for GBV and child protection.\n- Cash shortages continue to hinder the use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) by some recipients, negatively affecting living conditions, increasing the risk of exposure to violence or exploitation for women and girls, and undermining the ability of partners to pay local service providers and staff salaries. Meanwhile, the price of most basic commodities available in local markets has more than quadrupled.\nEducation\nResponse\n- During the reporting period, 15 new Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS) have been established in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, benefiting approximately 2,500 students. To date, a total of 215 TLSs serving nearly 34,000 children have been set up across the Strip, in which school-aged children participate in informal learning focused on essential literacy and numeracy skill and receive mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to help them cope with and recover from traumatic experiences.\n- There has also been a notable increase in community-led education initiatives, with over 25 new initiatives reported to the Cluster during the reporting period. This rise reflects the communities\u2019 continued demand for and prioritization of education. Cluster partners are actively engaging with these communities to provide support, aiming to expand coverage and enhance the quality of services offered.\nChallenges\n- The entry of education supplies continues to be restricted, with the latest denial of shipments of prefabricated structures essential for creating temporary learning spaces. As winter approaches, these supplies are crucial for enhancing these spaces; without them, access to education during peak winter will be nearly impossible.\n- According to geospatial analysis by the Education Cluster, eight TLSs serving 887 students are directly located within flood-prone areas, another 24 TLSs benefiting nearly 5,800 students are less than 100 metres away from such areas, and an additional 14 TLSs serving almost 3,000 students are within 100 metres from the coastline. These spaces are expected to face flooding and become inaccessible during the rainy season, with restrictions on the entry of winterproof tents hampering the implementation of crucial mitigation measures.\n- The continued targeting of schools is further destroying educational infrastructure and instilling fear in parents and children, hindering participation in temporary learning activities. In September alone, 17 instances of airstrikes by the Israeli military on schools were reported, including 10 incidents in the Gaza and North Gaza governorates. These include at least 14 schools that were hosting IDPs, of which seven are operated by UNRWA.\n- As of 1 October, according to the Ministry of Education, 10,449 students and 419 educational staff have been killed in Gaza, while over 16,250 students and 2,463 teachers have been injured since the escalation of hostilities on 7 October. The Education Cluster urgently calls for adherence to International Humanitarian Law, which protects schools during conflicts. Ongoing violations threaten emergency education efforts aimed at addressing children's trauma and providing essential learning in the absence of formal education.\nEmergency Telecommunications (ETC)\nResponse\n- On 18 September, the first batch of 25 \u201cTrack24\u201d satellite-based devices were dispatched to Gaza. Of these, 15 will be used by the World Food Programme (WFP) in its operations and 10 will be handed to other UN agencies to support their mission movements in Gaza. The ETC is currently working to configure these devices.\n- On 19 September, the ETC Cluster secured a pre-clearance from the Israeli authorities to import 78 \u201cTrack24\u201d devices to Jerusalem, which are intended for use by 11 UN agencies operating in Gaza. The pre-clearance will expedite customs clearance upon arrival at the Tel Aviv airport.\n- The ETC Cluster continues to advocate for the need to import more telecommunications equipment into Gaza to set up common communications services. More information on ETC activities can be accessed here.\nChallenges\n- Due to increased restrictions on the movement of commodities, damaged infrastructure and lack of fuel and spare parts, local Mobile Network Operators and Internet Service Providers in the Gaza Strip continue to experience network outages and are unable to conduct the necessary repairs. Current conditions render it difficult to maintain the functionality of the remaining network and have resulted in the loss of connectivity in Rafah.\n- The availability of telecommunications equipment is severely limited, hampering the delivery of ETC services. A significant amount of equipment has been damaged or destroyed, and the import of new equipment is lengthy and challenging. Only 20 satellite phones, 25 Track24 devices, 20 Garmin inReach Messenger devices, 30 VHF digital radios, four VHR repeaters and four solar power solutions have been coordinated for importation into Gaza with Israeli authorities since 7 October 2023.\n- Increasing insecurity, displacement, and relocation of staff from Rafah to Deir al Balah have rendered it difficult to deploy shared ETC communications services or provide face-to-face technical support for humanitarian responders.\n- The lack of funding has limited the ETC Cluster\u2019s capacity to address immediate communications needs for humanitarian responders in Gaza. Thus far, only 45.8 per cent of funding requested by the Cluster (US$1.8 million) under the updated OPT Flash Appeal has been received.\nIASC Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA)\nResponse\n- During the last three weeks of September, the PSEA Network conducted seven PSEA Training-of-Trainer (ToT) sessions for aid organizations in central and southern Gaza. To date, 29 participants (18 females and 11 males) have successfully completed the ToT sessions and will now serve as PSEA focal points. In total, 130 staff from 80 different organizations have registered to participate in these sessions.\n- During the reporting period, the PSEA Network trained 12 aid workers (8 females and 5 males) involved in the humanitarian response in northern Gaza and delivered one PSEA orientation session to 15 polio vaccinators.\n- About 95,000 \"No Excuse\" cards were distributed to six PSEA network partners that are conducting PSEA awareness-raising sessions with communities.\n- In September, the PSEA Network\u2019s media campaign (SANAD) saw a moderate increase in audience reach, with 1.6 million people reached through Facebook and over half a million reached through Instagram. Women continue to be the most engaged, constituting over 60 percent of SANAD\u2019s followers, with the highest engagement rate by people aged 25-44 years. In terms of geographical distribution, 28 per cent of SANAD\u2019s total audience is from Gaza city, 8 per cent from Rafah, and 3 per cent from Deir Al-Balah.\nChallenges\n- Access restrictions to northern Gaza have caused delays in providing essential services to the most vulnerable individuals, as well as in conducting awareness-raising sessions on PSEA.\nDisclaimer\n- UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n- To learn more about OCHA's activities, please visit https://www.unocha.org/.",

For an overview of priority needs and activities by cluster, please see the Flash Appeal.\n\nHealth\n\nResponse\n\nDuring the reporting period, 56 Health Cluster partners were active in Gaza, with 48 operating health service points, reaching about 300,000 people per week.\n\nAs of 29 September, there were 15 emergency medical teams (EMTs) supporting the local health-care workforce, including three in northern Gaza.\n\nAs part of a new national EMT project launched by WHO in northern Gaza, 240 national EMT doctors have been deployed to the Emergency Department of the Al-Shifa Hospital to provide both trauma and non-trauma related health services.\n\nPreparations are underway for the second round of the polio vaccination campaign, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October and will include the distribution of Vitamin A supplements.\n\nIn the northern governorates, health partners have distributed 2,700 postpartum kits (PPK) to health facilities and shared guidance outlining distribution criteria and use modalities with relevant health workers.\n\nA blood donation campaign was conducted in the West Bank during the last week of September to collect blood units for patients in Gaza, including those suffering from Thalassemia. A total of 3,000 blood units were collected and were delivered to health facilities in both northern and southern Gaza on 30 September.\n\nOn 29 September, eight patients, including seven children, were evacuated from Gaza for specialized medical care in Romania. They traveled along with 24 companions. Half of the patients have cancer, two have blood disease, one needs a kidney transplant, and one has a severe injury. On six occasions, 229 patients along with 316 companions have been exceptionally evacuated since the closure of Rafah Crossing on 7 May.\n\nChallenges\n\nHealth facilities continue to face severe supply shortages due to obstacles hindering the entry of humanitarian aid and a growing backlog of health supplies and equipment awaiting entry into Gaza. In particular, partners continue to face major security and access constraints in reaching medical facilities in northern Gaza, which is also impeding fuel deliveries and forcing all healthcare facilities in the north to ration fuel supplies and interrupt some services.\n\nThe lack of a systematic mechanism for the medical evacuation of critically ill and injured patients out of Gaza results in an ever-growing waiting list. As of 30 September, it is estimated that 12,000 patients need medical evacuation, as the clinical conditions of many deteriorate.\n\nOvercrowding in displacement sites, poor water, hygiene and sanitation conditions, and the lack of essential items are contributing to growing reproductive health risks and increasing vulnerability to gender-based violence (GBV) and\n---\nexploitation.\n\nThere are growing public health concerns for the anticipated deterioration of living conditions during the winter season in displacement sites, particularly in flood-prone areas. In a joint assessment published on 25 September, the Health and WASH Clusters\u202fwarned\u202fthat many IDP sites are assessed to be located in or near flooding hotspots and additional locations are vulnerable to flooding at present.\n\nNutrition Response\n\nThe Cluster has trained 17 analysts for the upcoming Integrated Phase Classification for acute malnutrition (IPC-AMN) exercise, with the support of the IPC Global Support Unit. The Cluster has also benefited from the support of the SMART Initiative to analyze more than 40,000 Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) screening data collected by Nutrition Cluster partners between mid-August and mid-September, to better understand the malnutrition situation in each governorate.\n\nIn September, 24,281 children were screened for malnutrition. Since mid-January, a total of 318,603 children aged 6-59 months have been screened for malnutrition, including 70,329 in the northern governorates. Of all screened children, 21,638 have been diagnosed with acute malnutrition, including 16,872 with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and 4,766 with severe acute malnutrition (SAM); of those with SAM, 145 had medical complications. Treatment is provided at four stabilization centres and 102 outpatient programme sites across the Strip.\n\nIn September, 49,647 children under the age of five and 18,339 pregnant or breastfeeding women (PBW) received supplementary feeding, either through lipid-based nutrient supplements (LBNS) or high energy biscuits (HEB). Nutrition partners also provided 35,366 caregivers with counselling for breastfeeding and for adapted complementary feeding of children aged six months and older.\n\nChallenges\n\nTransport and adequate storage of nutrition supplies is challenging because of the limited entry of humanitarian supplies, limited ability to store products that require refrigeration such as ready-to-use infant formula, and the loss of access to some warehouses due to ongoing hostilities, evacuation orders, access, and logistical constraints.\n\nContinuous displacement is disrupting distribution, service delivery, and case monitoring, especially among children, and access to nutrition sites. Coordinating nutrition support for newly displaced people arriving at shelters is increasingly complex.\n\nFood Security Response\n\nAs. of the third week of September, about 600,000 cooked meals prepared in more than 150 kitchens were provided daily to families across the Strip. However, this level of meal production is expected to decrease in October due to dwindling supplies. Overall, in September, due to continuous food supply shortages, more than 1.4 million people did not receive their monthly food rations across Gaza and in the central and southern governorates partners are providing only one food parcel per family per month, compared with two parcels per family in the north.\n\nAs of 29 September, 14 bakeries supported by humanitarian partners were operational in the Gaza Strip \u2013 one in Khan Younis, seven in Deir al Balah, four in Gaza city and two in Jabalya. Partners are endeavoring to urgently provide more fuel to these facilities. Five bakeries in Rafah remain closed due to ongoing hostilities and access constraints. Critically, the continued functionality of the six bakeries in northern Gaza is contingent on securing yeast or shifting to the production of yeast-free bread.\n\nFollowing recent inter-cluster rapid assessments, partners are now mobilizing to reach communities in areas such as eastern Khan Younis that were previously inaccessible by humanitarian actors, to provide food parcels and cooked meals, particularly to the most vulnerable groups.\n\nChallenges\n\nHumanitarian food supplies are incredibly limited across the Strip. In southern and central Gaza, FSS partners lack sufficient food stocks to meet requirements and have scaled down distribution significantly for the third consecutive month since July, with food supply shortages expected to continue in October. In northern Gaza, cargo movement was temporarily suspended via the Jordan corridor following a security incident at Allenby Bridge on 8 September, affecting partners\u2019 supply flows. As of 29 September, at least 100,000 metric tons of food commodities, equivalent to two months of food rations for the whole population, await entry outside the Strip and must be urgently brought in to ensure continuous food distribution. There are also great concerns for the increasing risk of spoilage and infestation of stranded food supplies.\n\nThe entry of commercial cargo continues to be limited. The Cluster continues to advocate for the delivery of commercial goods at scale across the Strip to complement humanitarian efforts, increase dietary diversity and stimulate the local economy by increasing the affordability and availability of products, as well as improving cash liquidity.\n---\nRecent military operations in Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, have led to the additional destruction of more than 50 dunums (five hectares) of agriculture land and agriculture assets, including fields planted with eggplants, oranges, peppers and other vegetables owned by at least ten farmers. The latest satellite imagery\u202fcollected\u202fby UNOSAT in September 2024 shows that approximately 68 per cent (102 square kilometres) of permanent crop fields in Gaza exhibit a significant decline in health and density, compared with the average of the previous seven years.\n\nWhile the olive harvest season in Gaza has started, there is sharp decrease in olive production due to mass destruction of olive orchards, with more than one million olive trees uprooted since the escalation of hostilities in October 2023. Only four out of 37 olive presses remain functional throughout the Strip, but challenging access to fuel represents a key obstacle hampering the use of even this remaining equipment.\n\nThe significant increase in firewood prices continues to push an increasing number of people into energy poverty, exacerbated by the limited availability of gas and the ongoing electricity cuts. It is anticipated that the energy crisis will further worsen as the rainy winter season approaches. In the north, the lack of entry of cooking gas has entered its 12th consecutive month. Protracted shortages of energy sources for cooking continue to force displaced families to cook by burning wood from waste, which hinders proper food preparation and nutrition intake, exacerbates health and protection risks, and causes environmental hazards.\n\nThe extremely limited entry of fertilizers and other livestock and crop production inputs is a key obstacle hampering the restoration of local food production in Gaza. A dual-track approach is required to food assistance and emergency livelihood interventions. Agricultural activities, including small-scale gardening that is critical to enhance dietary diversity, remain largely suspended.\n\nIf physical road access, health-care provision, as well as energy, water, sanitation, hygiene, and shelter conditions are further compromised, there is a high risk that the food insecurity and malnutrition situation will worsen beyond the already alarming rates observed.\n\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Response\n\nBetween 21 to 27 September, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) and Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) reported that the average water supply for safe drinking and domestic purposes was about 116,000 cubic metres per day across the Gaza Strip, or just over a quarter of water supply provided prior to October 2023. This includes 78,600 cubic metres of water produced by municipal and UNRWA water wells.\n\nBetween 21 and 27 September, WASH Cluster partners received a total of 123,164 litres of fuel, or an average of 17,500 litres per day, which represents only 25 per cent of the minimum daily requirement of 70,000 litres to meet critical WASH and public health needs. This delivery marks a four per cent reduction compared to the quantity received between 14 and 21 September.\n\nThe WASH Cluster completed a Rapid Joint WASH Assessment across the Gaza Strip, to assess the severity of WASH needs and the most critical service gaps for displaced people, and to inform response planning.\n\nChallenges\n\nThere is an urgent need for generators, submersible pumps and other critical supplies for water wells and pumping stations as they remain largely unavailable on the local market.\n\nThe lack of access to soap and other basic hygiene items is severely hindering families\u2019 ability to protect themselves from communicable diseases, especially in overcrowded shelters, disproportionately affecting children, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems. Key products like shampoo, detergent, and dishwashing liquid are no longer available, making it impossible for households to maintain cleanliness, prepare food safely, or wash clothes. Health-care facilities are also struggling to maintain proper sanitation, increasing the risk of infections for patients and staff.\n\nThe flow of water from the main transmission line running from Israel remains at only 80 per cent of capacity, with several critical water facilities damaged and rendered inaccessible in recent weeks. Water supply through the middle and southern connection points must be urgently increased to full capacity.\n\nShelter and Non-Food Items (NFI) Response\n\nThe Shelter Cluster continues to track the needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) whose shelters have been damaged by hostilities or flooded. Recently, two Cluster partners assessed a displacement site west of Al-Rasheed Street, on the Costal Road, to identify households most vulnerable to tidal impacts during the winter season and assess necessary shelter assistance.\n\nDespite supply shortages, and where possible, the Cluster provides shelter support, including tents, sealing-off kits and non-food items.\u202fBetween 16 and 29 September, Cluster partners distributed 620 family tents and 3,300 pieces of tarpaulin to households in need in southern Gaza. Tents and a limited quantity of sealing-off kits were also provided to households in northern Gaza.\n---\nChallenges\n\nShelter Cluster partners continue to face challenges in importing shelter materials, which is deeply concerning as the winter season approaches. The Cluster has been forced to prioritise the bare minimum of shelter items, which would not constitute dignified shelter. This means that, even if these minimum supplies are brought in, affected households will not be adequately protected in the winter.\n\nA shortage of shelter items could lead to increased health risks, potential fatalities, and even protests. In September, cluster partners received only nine trucks of shelter items via the Fence Road, which is currently the main route for these supplies. Overall, 0.9 million people across Gaza require winterization support.\n\nInclement weather will also exacerbate the risk of collapse for damaged buildings in which many families are sheltering. Without access to undertake assessments, capacity to conduct repairs, or anywhere else for families to go, the cluster is not able to practically support those in damaged buildings other than alerting them of the risks through awareness-raising messages.\n\nSite Management Working Group (SMWG) Response\n\nDuring the reporting period, SMWG partners monitored 38 sites hosting approximately 170,875 people in the Khan Younis, Deir al Balah, Gaza and North Gaza governorates. Identified needs and response gaps were shared with partners to guide response efforts.\n\nSMWG partners have begun rapid assessments of coastal sites considered highly vulnerable to the rising tide, to inform response planning.\n\nA draft analysis of empty land plots was conducted in Deir al Balah to support local authorities in identifying areas for the potential relocation of people affected by tidal rise and/or flooding, which should only be considered as a last resort. Before any preparatory work commences, the sites need to be cleared from potential unexploded ordnance by UNMAS.\n\nChallenges\n\nSMWG partners lack sufficient human resources to carry out needed assessments at IDP sites.\n\nConstant population movements caused by evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military and rapid changes in developments on the ground due to hostilities are hindering the implementation of an effective site management response.\n\nProtection Response\n\nThe Protection Cluster continues to expand the pool of staff and volunteers serving as Emergency Protection Responders (EPRs), with more than 100 already trained. EPRs have been mobilized in the majority of inter-cluster assessments to support, along with Protection Cluster staff, the conduct of key informant interviews, facilitate focus group discussions at the community level, and refer protection cases as needed to specialized Protection partners or to other clusters.\n\nWhile 12 GBV partners were able to distribute 1,900 dignity kits in Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, this is far below the scale of needs, with over 800,000 dignity kits estimated to be required at present. The dramatic spike in prices and the irregular availability of hygiene supplies on the market leave many women and girls with no means to cope with this gap, with dire shortages of blankets, shoes, warm clothes and other winter items expected to soon exacerbate their suffering. The GBV sub-cluster is assessing the potential for cash assistance to address the urgent needs of women and girls, but the unavailability of cash in Gaza continues to be hinder support.\n\nJointly with the Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) Technical Working Group, there are ongoing efforts to strengthen MHPSS services for women and girls at risk of GBV, including those with disabilities, and increase the capacity of GBV frontline workers to provide support and align their service provision with GBV Minimum Standards.

Between 14 and 27 September, partners completed 13 explosive hazard assessments (EHAs) and took part in five inter agency missions.\n\nUNRWA\u2019s protection teams continue to identify and respond to protection risks and the needs of displaced people in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, including Al Mawasi. They are visiting shelters and IDP sites, providing awareness sessions on EORE, GBV and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), undertaking focus group discussions and key informant interviews with IDPs, monitoring aid distribution, and following up on previously identified vulnerable cases.\n---\nWith the Education Cluster, Protection Monitors also continue to closely monitor learning activities in shelters to ensure that the safety, dignity, and wellbeing of children are prioritised, and any protection issue or concern is timely addressed.\n\nChallenges\n\nInsecurity, the disruption of aid flows, the breakdown of law and order, and the denial or restriction on entry of critical items by the Israeli authorities continue to hinder the Protection response.

The PSS needs remain vast, and it is critical that more kits be approved for entry into the Strip.\n\nWhile the Child Protection sub-cluster and UNICEF are endeavoring to reunify unaccompanied and separated children with their parent(s) and families, barriers include frequent denial of missions. Currently, at least 60 children have been identified by UNICEF and UNRWA who require reunification with their families.\n\nLack of funding and impeded access by Israeli authorities for specialized personnel and equipment for the clearance and disposal of deep-buried bombs (DBB) hamper people\u2019s protection from explosive remnants of war (ERW) and the safe and sustainable delivery of humanitarian aid. Mine Action stresses the need to obtain meaningful data from the Israeli authorities regarding the geographical location of ERW and hazardous areas.\n\nThe ongoing power cuts and limited access to communications services, coupled with fuel shortages and damage to key infrastructure, continue to curtail mobility. Insecurity, bombardments and ensuing displacement continue to constrain community outreach and protection activities, including proper case management for GBV and child protection.\n\nCash shortages continue to hinder the use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) by some recipients, negatively affecting living conditions, increasing the risk of exposure to violence or exploitation for women and girls, and undermining the ability of partners to pay local service providers and staff salaries. Meanwhile, the price of most basic commodities available in local markets has more than quadrupled.\n\nEducation Response\n\nDuring the reporting period, 15 new Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS) have been established in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah, benefiting approximately 2,500 students. To date, a total of 215 TLSs serving nearly 34,000 children have been set up across the Strip, in which school-aged children participate in informal learning focused on essential literacy and numeracy skill and receive mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to help them cope with and recover from traumatic experiences.\n\nThere has also been a notable increase in community-led education initiatives, with over 25 new initiatives reported to the Cluster during the reporting period. This rise reflects the communities\u2019 continued demand for and prioritization of education. Cluster partners are actively engaging with these communities to provide support, aiming to expand coverage and enhance the quality of services offered.\n\nChallenges\n\nThe entry of education supplies continues to be restricted, with the latest denial of shipments of prefabricated structures essential for creating temporary learning spaces. As winter approaches, these supplies are crucial for enhancing these spaces; without them, access to education during peak winter will be nearly impossible.\n\nAccording to geospatial analysis by the Education Cluster, eight TLSs serving 887 students are directly located within flood-prone areas, another 24 TLSs benefiting nearly 5,800 students are less than 100 metres away from such areas, and an additional 14 TLSs serving almost 3,000 students are within 100 metres from the coastline. These spaces are expected to face flooding and become inaccessible during the rainy season, with restrictions on the entry of winterproof tents hampering the implementation of crucial mitigation measures.\n\nThe continued targeting of schools is further destroying educational infrastructure and instilling fear in parents and children, hindering participation in temporary learning activities. In September alone, 17 instances of airstrikes by the Israeli military on schools were reported, including 10 incidents in the Gaza and North Gaza governorates. These include at least 14 schools that were hosting IDPs, of which seven are operated by UNRWA.\n\nAs of 1 October, according to the Ministry of Education, 10,449 students and 419 educational staff have been killed in Gaza, while over 16,250 students and 2,463 teachers have been injured since the escalation of hostilities on 7 October. The Education Cluster urgently calls for adherence to International Humanitarian Law, which protects schools during conflicts. Ongoing violations threaten emergency education efforts aimed at addressing children's trauma and providing essential learning in the absence of formal education.\n---\nEmergency Telecommunications (ETC)\n\nResponse\n\nOn 18 September, the first batch of 25 \u201cTrack24\u201d satellite-based devices were dispatched to Gaza. Of these, 15 will be used by the World Food Programme (WFP) in its operations and 10 will be handed to other UN agencies to support their mission movements in Gaza. The ETC is currently working to configure these devices.\n\nOn 19 September, the ETC Cluster secured a pre-clearance from the Israeli authorities to import 78 \u201cTrack24\u201d devices to Jerusalem, which are intended for use by 11 UN agencies operating in Gaza. The pre-clearance will expedite customs clearance upon arrival at the Tel Aviv airport.\n\nThe ETC Cluster continues to advocate for the need to import more telecommunications equipment into Gaza to set up common communications services. More information on ETC activities can be accessed here.\n\nChallenges\n\nDue to increased restrictions on the movement of commodities, damaged infrastructure and lack of fuel and spare parts, local Mobile Network Operators and Internet Service Providers in the Gaza Strip continue to experience network outages and are unable to conduct the necessary repairs. Current conditions render it difficult to maintain the functionality of the remaining network and have resulted in the loss of connectivity in Rafah.\n\nThe availability of telecommunications equipment is severely limited, hampering the delivery of ETC services. A significant amount of equipment has been damaged or destroyed, and the import of new equipment is lengthy and challenging. Only 20 satellite phones, 25 Track24 devices, 20 Garmin inReach Messenger devices, 30 VHF digital radios, four VHR repeaters and four solar power solutions have been coordinated for importation into Gaza with Israeli authorities since 7 October 2023.\n\nIncreasing insecurity, displacement, and relocation of staff from Rafah to Deir al Balah have rendered it difficult to deploy shared ETC communications services or provide face-to-face technical support for humanitarian responders.\n\nThe lack of funding has limited the ETC Cluster\u2019s capacity to address immediate communications needs for humanitarian responders in Gaza. Thus far, only 45.8 per cent of funding requested by the Cluster (US$1.8 million) under the updated OPT Flash Appeal has been received.\n\nIASC Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA)\n\nResponse\n\nDuring the last three weeks of September, the PSEA Network conducted seven PSEA Training-of-Trainer (ToT) sessions for aid organizations in central and southern Gaza. To date, 29 participants (18 females and 11 males) have successfully completed the ToT sessions and will now serve as PSEA focal points. In total, 130 staff from 80 different organizations have registered to participate in these sessions.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the PSEA Network trained 12 aid workers (8 females and 5 males) involved in the humanitarian response in northern Gaza and delivered one PSEA orientation session to 15 polio vaccinators.\n\nAbout 95,000 \"No Excuse\" cards were distributed to six PSEA network partners that are conducting PSEA awareness- raising sessions with communities.\n\nIn September, the PSEA Network\u2019s media campaign (SANAD) saw a moderate increase in audience reach, with 1.6 million people reached through Facebook and over half a million reached through Instagram. Women continue to be the most engaged, constituting over 60 percent of SANAD\u2019s followers, with the highest engagement rate by people aged 25-44 years. In terms of geographical distribution, 28 per cent of SANAD\u2019s total audience is from Gaza city, 8 per cent from Rafah, and 3 per cent from Deir Al-Balah.\n\nChallenges Access restrictions to northern Gaza have caused delays in providing essential services to the most vulnerable individuals, as well as in conducting awareness-raising sessions on PSEA.",
