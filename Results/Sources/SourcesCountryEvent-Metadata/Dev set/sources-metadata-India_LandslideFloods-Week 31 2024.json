The committee\u2019s report highlighted the prolonged application of laws such as the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) \u2014 described by Human Rights Watch as a \u201ctool of state abuse, oppression and discrimination\u201d \u2014 in \u201cdisturbed areas\u201d, leading to widespread and severe human rights violations, including excessive use of force resulting in unlawful killings, prolonged arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced displacement and torture.\nIn addition, the UN panel has also urged India to take decisive action to end violence against minority groups in Kashmir and other occupied territories and to adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination laws. The report specifically addresses the issues faced by Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, scheduled castes and tribes, as well as other oppressed groups, emphasising the urgent need for action to address these concerns. The UN body has also noted that the Indian state is subjecting its own citizens to \u201cwidespread and severe human rights violations, including excessive use of force resulting in unlawful killings, prolonged arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced displacement and torture\u201d.\nThe Human Rights Committee\u2019s recommendation to establish a mechanism to acknowledge responsibility and investigate human rights violations in Occupied Kashmir and other regions with separatist movements or unrest makes for a significant step towards ensuring accountability and justice for the affected population, but as history has shown, India has zero interest in taking criticism from renowned human rights activists and groups, instead accusing them of meddling in \u201cIndia\u2019s internal matters\u201d. Meanwhile, Indian critics are routinely harassed and run out of town to ensure domestic criticism stays on the fringes.",

The landslide caused extensive damage to many lives, homes and livelihoods. The extent of the destruction has left an estimated 1,680 individuals displaced, with an estimated 3,979 individuals affected and at risk of displacement. Furthermore; 9,952 individuals are estimated to be directly affected by the landslide. Immediate emergency response and long-term recovery plans are crucial to address the needs of these affected populations and mitigate future risks and vulnerabilities.\nThe landslide has not only devastated the Yambali ward but also caused significant instability in the surrounding area. The soil remains highly unstable, with visible cracks indicating imminent threats to lives and properties. Ongoing geo-seismic activities in the vicinity exacerbate the risk, as the land continues to shift. The landslide covered two creeks with debris and boulders, blocking waterways and increasing the likelihood of further slides. The blockage of these creeks poses a critical risk of flooding, which could trigger additional landslides, endangering the already vulnerable community.\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM), in collaboration with the Enga Provincial Disaster Response Team and Site Management team, conducted a Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) assessment across all affected wards (Yambali, Pokolip, Kuandak, and Yuyango) between June-July 2024. This assessment was carried out by enumerators through field observations, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews with both affected populations and local authorities and as well critical sectoral needs were identified. The assessment also highlighted ongoing risks of displacement in high-risk areas prone to further landslides and environmental hazards. The findings presented in this DTM report emphasize the urgent need for targeted humanitarian assistance to meet these evolving needs and mitigate risks effectively.",

Seventy-seven bodies have been identified so far and mostly handed to their relatives, he added.\nMore than a dozen bodies were found overnight, Aijaz said, as over 300 rescuers worked to pull out people stuck under mud and debris, but blocked roads and unstable terrain hampered their efforts.\nThe first landslide occurred at 2 a.m. on Tuesday, followed by another two hours later. Several areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, were isolated, and roads were washed away causing immense damage to homes, said Kerala\u2019s top elected official, Pinarayi Vijayan.\n\u201cEfforts to locate missing persons continue with all available resources,\u201d their statement said.\nMundakka is in an area highly prone to disasters.

Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Local TV news channels also aired phone calls from stranded people asking for help.\nAuthorities mobilized helicopters to help with rescue efforts and the Indian army was roped in to build a temporary bridge.\n\u201cWe are trying every way to rescue our people,\u201d state Health Minister Veena George said.",

This was used to provide 133,672 rations in what is considered one of the world\u2019s most protracted crises where 78% of refugees are food insecure.\n\u201cWe are extremely grateful to the EU for continuing their support and solidifying their humanitarian assistance to the Sahrawi refugees in Algeria,\u201d said WFP Representative and Country Director in Algeria Aline Rumonge. \u201cThis partnership means that we have stable and predictable funding which allows us to continue to deliver vital food assistance some of the most vulnerable people who have very limited income opportunities.\u201d\nRefugees from Western Sahara have lived in camps near the remote southwestern Algerian town of Tindouf since 1975. Heat, scarcity of water and the challenging political and socio-economic context, mean people struggle to access livelihood opportunities. Most of the camp population depend on WFP assistance to cover their dietary needs.\nIn 2023, thanks to donors like the EU, WFP distributed more than 2,000 metric tons of in-kind food assistance per month. Some 8,600 pregnant and nursing mothers received monthly cash-based transfers (CBT) to diversify their diets and thereby contribute to anemia prevention. WFP also provides special nutritious food to treat and prevent moderate acute malnutrition and anemia among women and children under five.\nThe EU is the largest donor to WFP in Algeria. Since 2003, the total EU contributions supporting WFP\u2019s operations for Sahrawi refugees in the country have reached \u20ac97 million (US$118 million).\nWFP has been supporting the Sahrawi refugees in Algeria since 1986.

Many were still missing and feared to have been washed away in the muddy, fast flowing water that gushed through the area.\nThe landslides took place in the early hours of the morning, when people were asleep in their homes which were crushed by mud and uprooted trees.\nAccess to the affected site remained difficult for rescuers amid heavy monsoon rain and destroyed roads. The army was asked to build a temporary crossing after a bridge in the district that linked the affected forest area to the nearest town of Chooralmala was destroyed, forest minister A K Saseendran told reporters.\n\u201cThe situation is serious.

I hope those still trapped are brought to safety soon,\u201d said Gandhi in a post on X.\nThe south Indian state of Kerala has increasingly been hit by flooding and landslides caused by irregular and intense rainfall during the monsoon seasons.\nIn August 2018, almost 500 people died after severe flooding across the state due to unusually heavy rainfall, the worst floods to hit in a century.",

        "content": "title: Satellite imagery, machine learning to map flooding in urban areas \n content: New model uses satellite imagery, machine learning to map flooding in urban environments\nAs climate change causes storms to intensify, new tools are needed to map where flooding occurs in under-studied areas.\nA new mapping tool from North Carolina State University uses machine learning and open-source satellite imagery to model flooding in urban environments. The new model could create maps that predict urban area flooding, which traditionally have not been accessible to urban planners. This could help identify potentially flood-prone areas in urban settings, helping officials make better-informed choices about where to allocate flood resiliency and prevention resources.\nRebecca Composto, a graduate student at NC State and lead author of a paper describing the model, said that urban areas present unique challenges in collecting satellite data and tracking the flow of water. \"One of the first issues is building shadows. Taller buildings create more shadows, which means that the satellite imagery appears darker and carries less information,\" she said. \"Urban areas also have more complex hydrology, as the existence of so many drainage systems along with concrete surfaces that don't soak up water means that it's harder to predict where water accumulates.\"\nFlooding in urban areas also tends to both start and end quickly, sometimes too quickly for satellites to gather enough usable data. To address this, Composto used satellite data from Hurricane Ida, which caused significant flooding and damage in the northeastern U.S. in 2021. Flooding from Ida lasted longer than usual in areas like Philadelphia, and this combined with a sudden break in cloud cover gave Composto just the kind of satellite data she needed.\nThe next step was to train a machine-learning model to recognize and map flooding. To create sufficient training data for the model to recognize urban flooding, Composto spent months hand-drawing polygons onto her satellite imagery to help the program understand what it was looking at. These polygons helped the machine-learning algorithm \"see\" the characteristics of satellite imagery most aligned with flooding and then map the flooding.\nComposto then compared the resulting map, known as a flood extent, to Federal Emergency Management Agency flood zones. These zones designate areas depending on how likely they are to flood - for example, a \"500-year\" flood zone has an approximately 1-in-500 chance of flooding each year. Other areas are deemed \"minimal flood hazard,\" which places them outside the limit of the 500-year flood designation.\nThe model found that more flooding was occurring in these minimal hazard areas than in the 500-year zones. Composto said that this was likely due to the much larger size of the minimal hazard zones - despite having more flooding by volume, the risk of flooding in these areas was still proportionally smaller than in the 500-year zones.\nFurther research might focus on simplifying the model for ease of use. Composto plans to integrate a new map displaying flood depth and make her code open source to make it easier to share with emergency-response leaders.",

Kerala\u2019s summers tend to be very wet, and these rainfall totals are standard for this time of year.\nHeavy flooding and mudslides have killed hundreds, displaced millions and wrecked infrastructure across South Asia in recent months. While floods are common in the region during monsoon season, scientists say the climate crisis has exacerbated extreme weather events and made them more deadly.\nChina has also experienced weeks of damaging rain triggering floods and landslides.\nIn a post to X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was \u201cdistressed by the landslides in parts of Wayanad.

Most of the victims were tea estate workers and their families who lived in small houses or makeshift shelters.\nTelevision images showed rescue workers scrambling through uprooted trees and flattened tin structures as boulders lay strewn across the hillsides and muddy water gushed through. Rescuers were being pulled across a stream, carrying stretchers and other equipment to rescue people.\nAt least 123 people were killed in the landslides, 128 injured and dozens unaccounted for, state authorities said. Local Asianet TV put the death toll higher at 119.\nYesterday's landslides are the worst disaster in the state since 2018 when heavy floods killed almost 400 people.\n\"There are still people who are trapped under the ground and those who have been swept away,\" Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters. \"The rescue operation will continue with all possible strength and means.\"\nMore than 3,000 people had been moved out of the area and accommodated in 45 relief camps in the district, he said, adding that hundreds of personnel, including army soldiers, using drones and sniffer dogs were searching for survivors amid heavy rains, reports Reuters.\nVijayan, a survivor who gave only one name, said he woke up in the middle of the night to feel the ground shake and see electric poles fall.\n\"A couple of neighbours and I ran to nearby houses where we heard cries for help and took some of the injured to safety,\" he told Asianet.\n\"My father, mother, sister and her daughter were in the house and as I went towards them the next landslide hit with a roaring sound,\" he said. \"I clung to a window bar as I saw my mother and sister disappear under the mud, I couldn't do anything.\"\nArmy engineers were deployed to help build a replacement bridge after the one that linked the affected area to the nearest town of Chooralmala was destroyed, the chief minister's office said in a statement.\n\"A small team has managed to cross the bridge across the river and reach (the site) but we will need to send many more to provide help and to start rescue operations,\" Kerala chief secretary V. Venu told reporters.\nA military helicopter managed to land at Mundakkai, one of the worst hit areas where about 250 people were stranded on a hilltop and at a tourist resort without enough food and medicine. They could not be accessed by air earlier due to bad weather, officials said.\nThis was expected to speed up rescue efforts and the injured would be evacuated first, they said.\nAlthough the area is a well-known tourist destination, local residents were the most affected as all tourist excursions had been halted since Monday due to the rain.\nChief Minister Vijayan said that many people had been moved out of the area before the landslides due to the heavy rain and this had helped reduce the toll.\nThe region was forecast to get 204 millimetres (8 inches) of rainfall but ended up getting 572 millimetres (22.5 inches) over a period of 48 hours, he said, adding that in the wake of \"climate change ... rainfall and other natural disasters are sometimes unpredictable\".\nMore rains were forecast across the state for the next five days, he said, and urged people to take precautions.",

Rescuers were working to pull out people stuck under mud and debris, but their efforts were hampered by blocked roads and unstable terrain.\nP M Manoj, press secretary to the Kerala chief minister, said the landslides had killed at least 70 people so far. Local media reported that most of the victims were tea estate workers.\nTelevision footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Local TV news channels also aired phone calls of stranded people asking for help.\nAuthorities mobilized helicopters to help with rescue efforts and the Indian army was roped in to build a temporary bridge after landslides destroyed a main bridge that linked the affected area.\n\"We are trying every way to rescue our people,\" state Health Minister Veena George said.\nIn a post on social media platform X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was \"distressed by the landslides in parts of Wayanad,\" a hilly district which is part of the Western Ghats mountain range.\n\"My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured,\" Modi wrote. He announced compensation of $2,388 to the victims' families.\nIndia's weather department has put Kerala on alert as the state has been lashed by incessant rains. Downpours have disrupted life for many, and authorities closed schools in some parts Tuesday. More rains are predicted through the day.\nKerala, one of India's most popular tourist destinations, is prone to heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Nearly 500 people were killed in the state in 2018 in one of the worst floods.\nThe Indian Meteorological Department said the state has had heavy rainfall over its northern and central regions, with Wayanad district recording up to 28 centimeters (11 inches) of rain in the past 24 hours.\n\"Monsoon patterns are increasingly erratic and the quantum of rainfall that we receive in a short spell of time has increased. As a result, we see frequent instances of landslides and floods along the Western Ghats,\" said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.\nKoll also said authorities must check on rapid construction activities happening over landslide areas.\n\"Often landslides and flashfloods occur over regions where the impact of both climate change and direct human intervention in terms of land use changes are evident,\" he said.\nA 2013 report by a federal government-appointed committee said that 37% of the total area of the Western Ghats mountains should be declared as an ecosensitive area and proposed restrictions on any form of construction. The report's recommendations have not been implemented so far because state governments and residents opposed it.\nIndia regularly has severe floods during the monsoon season, which runs between June and September and brings most of South Asia's annual rainfall. The rains are crucial for rain-fed crops planted during the season, but often cause extensive damage.\nScientists say monsoons are becoming more erratic because of climate change and global warming.",

Authorities have yet to determine the full scope of the disaster.\nKerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said the landslides had killed at least 93 people and more than 100 people were receiving treatment for injures. He said more than 3,000 people have been moved to relief camps.\nVijayan did not specify how many people were missing or trapped under the debris.\nLocal media reported that most of the victims were tea estate workers. Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Local TV news channels also aired phone calls of stranded people asking for help.\nAuthorities mobilized helicopters to help with rescue efforts and the Indian army was roped in to build a temporary bridge.\n\"We are trying every way to rescue our people,\" state Health Minister Veena George said.\nIn a post on social media platform X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was \"distressed by the landslides in parts of Wayanad,\" a hilly district which is part of the Western Ghats mountain range.\n\"My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured,\" Modi wrote. He announced compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,388) to the victims' families.\nIndia's weather department has put Kerala on alert as the state has been lashed by incessant rains. Downpours have disrupted life for many, and authorities closed schools in some parts Tuesday. More rains are predicted through the day.\nKerala, one of India's most popular tourist destinations, is prone to heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Nearly 500 people were killed in the state in 2018 in one of the worst floods.\nThe Indian Meteorological Department said the state has had heavy rainfall over its northern and central regions, with Wayanad district recording up to 28 centimeters (11 inches) of rain in the past 24 hours.\n\"Monsoon patterns are increasingly erratic and the quantum of rainfall that we receive in a short spell of time has increased. As a result, we see frequent instances of landslides and floods along the Western Ghats,\" said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.\nKoll also said authorities must check on rapid construction activities happening over landslide areas.\n\"Often landslides and flash floods occur over regions where the impact of both climate change and direct human intervention in terms of land use changes are evident,\" he said.\nA 2013 report by a federal government-appointed committee said that 37% of the total area of the Western Ghats mountains should be declared an ecosensitive area and proposed restrictions on any form of construction. The report's recommendations have not been implemented so far because state governments and residents opposed it.\nIndia regularly has severe floods during the monsoon season, which runs between June and September and brings most of South Asia's annual rainfall. The rains are crucial for rain-fed crops planted during the season, but often cause extensive damage.\nScientists say monsoons are becoming more erratic because of climate change and global warming.",

Now everything is buried in mud \n content: They ran for their lives as boulders and water banged at their door. Now everything is buried in mud\nWhen deadly landslides struck hillside villages in southern India on Tuesday, many people ran toward higher ground and watched their homes get swept away by torrents of mud, floodwater and giant rolling boulders\nWAYANAD, India -- When Deva Das was jolted awake by the roar of gushing water and boulders banging at the door, he grabbed his parents and his kids and began running for higher ground.\nThe family waded through slush and muck, climbed a hill, and stayed there in the pouring rain for nearly four hours. When day broke Tuesday, rescuers found the family and brought them down.\nWhen the 40-year-old agricultural laborer got back to the site of his village in southern India's Kerala state, there was nearly nothing left. Houses were gone, buried under mud or wiped away. Trees were uprooted, and roads were swept away. Families were frantically searching for their loved ones.\n\u201cIt was a happy village,\" said Das. \"Now everything is lost.\u201d He's staying at a relief center for displaced people.\nAt least 201 people have been killed in Kerala since Tuesday after multiple landslides in the hills of Wayanad district sent torrents of mud, floodwater and giant rolling boulders to downhill villages, burying people or sweeping them away several miles downstream. The disaster also left behind a trail of destruction in its wake by flattening hundreds of houses and destroying roads and bridges.\nImages from the site of disaster show gashes in the green hillside where mud slid down, as rescue workers trekked knee-deep in the muck to find missing people. Nearly 40 bodies were found some 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the area where the main landslides occurred, after being swept along the Chaliyar River. In some cases, rescuers found only body parts.\nHeavy-duty lifting equipment didn't reach some villages until late Thursday when a bridge constructed by Indian army engineers allowed vehicles to make their way towards the worst-hit areas.\nRescue workers continue to recover and identify bodies, and with nearly 200 people still missing, the death toll is expected to rise, P. M. Manoj, a spokesperson for Kerala's top elected official, said. More than 5,500 people were rescued from hillside villages and taken to relief centers.\nWayanad, a popular tourist destination, is known for picturesque hills dotted with tea and cardamom estates. It is also part of the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats, a mountain range that runs along the western coast of India.\nThe region is prone to heavy rains, flooding and landslides. In 2018, nearly 500 people were killed in the state after one of its worst floods left behind a trail of destruction. Since then, a construction boom in the region has made it even more vulnerable to flooding and landslides.\nMost of victims of Tuesday's disaster were migrant workers working in the tea and cardamom estates, who lived in a string of settlements, some on or near the top of the lush slopes. Other villages, including the ones buried by the landslides, are clustered at the foot of the hills.\nSeveral days of rain preceded the landslides. Some survivors said they knew such heavy rains could bring trouble.\nRakeeba, a tea estate worker, said the villagers were apprehensive and people were told to be cautious.\nWhen the first landslide struck her village at midnight Tuesday, the 45-year-old was asleep at home. When she looked around, water had already made it inside her house.\nWorried, Rakeeba ran uphill, and saw parts of the hillside above one village giving out, before floodwater and mud swept away everything in their path.\n\u201cWe don't know where we will go now. Those who were there are not there anymore,\u201d she said, holding back tears.",

But their efforts have been complicated by heavy rains.\nA hilly region known for its rugged terrain and stunning vistas, Wayanad is a popular tourist destination which attracts more than 100,000 visitors every year. The district is mainly inhabited by indigenous tribes and is dotted with picturesque tea and cardamom estates.\nA part of the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats - a mountain range that runs along the western coast of India - the district is not new to landslides.\nIn fact, a 2011 report submitted by a panel of experts, led by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, had classified the entire Wayanad region as \u201cfragile, medium fragile and less fragile area\u201d.\nThe report also recommended a ban on all \" environmentally-hazardous\" human activities along the Western Ghats, including in Wayanad.\nThe recommendations have since been continuously opposed by all political parties and governments of Kerala, who maintain that it would stall development in the area.\nIt was also opposed by the neighbouring state of Karnataka, which argued that it would impact livelihoods of local people.\nThe indecision on the issue has meant that environmentally-hazardous activities like deforestation, mining and building construction have continued in the region.\nExperts say excessive rainfall in Wayanad this season - about 60-70% higher than usual - has added to the scale of the disaster.\n\u201cThis time, the accumulated heavy rainfall of the last two weeks was followed with this extreme category rainfall of Tuesday, causing massive flooding,\u201d said Abhilash S, director of the department of atmospheric sciences in Cochin University of Science and Technology.\n\u201cThat was the primary triggering factor,\" he added.\nOthers point out that rapid urbanisation and increasing mining activities in surrounding areas have made the region even more fragile.\nIn 2019, 17 people died in a landslide that struck Puthumala, 10km (six miles) away from Tuesday\u2019s disaster. A report by the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) had then pointed out that the landslide was caused by rock mining and quarrying in the region.\n\u201cThis entire area has very steep slopes. The only thing that holds it together is vegetation,\" said TV Sajeev, the chief scientist of KFRI.\nBut in recent years, the Kerala government has allowed certain non-plantation activities in this region. \"As a result, plantation owners have shifted to tourism and built mega structures for which the ground had to be levelled, making it even more fragile,\" Mr Sajeev added.\nThe scientist says the government should go back to the Gadgil report that said fragile land must be managed in a different way.\n\u201cThe way out is to make sure that our ecological systems are really healthy. If they are healthy, they can handle any kind of climate change,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "title: Wayanad, Kerala - Devastating Landslides: Caritas India Responds to Tragedy \n content: On the early morning of Tuesday, July 30, 2024, a series of catastrophic landslides struck the hilly regions near Meppadi in Kerala\u2019s Wayanad district, resulting in significant loss of life and widespread destruction. The landslides, which occurred between 2 AM and 4 AM, have caused 295 fatalities (as of August 1, 2024, 7:14 PM) and left several people missing.\nThe most severely impacted areas include Mundakai, Chooralmala, Attamala, and Noolpuzha villages, with the heaviest damage reported in Mundakai and Chooralmala. Entire villages were buried under massive debris, with homes, shops, and vehicles swallowed by the earth. A crucial bridge was also washed away, cutting off access to the affected areas.\nDamage Overview\nThe scale of the disaster is staggering, with the following key damage data reported:\n\u2022 Total Fatalities: 295 bodies recovered, with 98 identified.\n\u2022 Missing Persons: 392 individuals are still unaccounted for, including 29 children.\n\u2022 Injuries: 220 people are currently hospitalized, with 101 receiving medical treatment.\n\u2022 Infrastructure Damage: 348 buildings have been severely damaged, including homes and essential facilities.\n\u2022 Relief Camps: 106 relief camps have been established, currently housing 11,645 displaced individuals.\nThe Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has mobilized Fire force and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams to the affected areas, where hundreds are feared to be trapped under the debris. The army-led search and rescue mission in landslide-hit Mundakkai and Chooralmala has saved 1,000 people, but local reports indicate that 392 people remain missing.\nCaritas India\u2019s Response\nIn response to this devastating tragedy, Caritas India, the national organ of the Catholic Church\u2019s social and humanitarian responses in India, has activated its Emergency response protocols and deployed a team on the ground. Caritas India is working closely with local diocesan organizations in Wayanad to assess the needs of the affected communities and plan both short-term relief support and long-term livelihood restoration and rehabilitation.\nCaritas representatives have been actively visiting relief camps, engaging with authorities and inmates to assess ongoing needs. This grassroots approach enables the organization to adapt its interventions and provide targeted assistance, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations receive the help they require.\nAs a follow-up, Caritas India Associate Director Fr Antony Fernandes will be visiting the affected areas on August 3, 2024, to further assess the situation and coordinate relief efforts. Additionally, Caritas India Executive Director Fr. (Dr.) Jolly Puthenpura will be visiting the affected areas on August 10, 2024, to oversee the ongoing response and plan for long-term rehabilitation.\nMost Rev. Andrews Thazhath, President of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of India, has issued a National Appeal for support, urging all people of goodwill and Church institutions to contribute generously to this humanitarian call. Caritas India is already on-site, coordinating with its local partners (WSSS, Shreyas, and Jeevana) to provide immediate relief support and trauma counseling to the affected communities.\nImmediate Needs and Ongoing Challenges\nAs rescue operations continue, the situation remains critical, with ongoing rain hampering efforts. The India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in Kerala for the next 24 hours, which could further affect the rescue operations. The scale of the disaster is immense, with hundreds still trapped under debris, and officials warn that the death toll could double.\nCaritas India is committed to standing with the people of Wayanad during this difficult time and will continue to work tirelessly to provide the necessary support and assistance to the affected communities. The organization appeals to all people of goodwill to come together in solidarity with these suffering people and contribute generously to this humanitarian call. Your support can make a significant difference in the lives of those affected by this tragedy.",

Pay attention to the frequency of major weather events happening in your country. Pay attention to the hotter times that you are experiencing on a daily basis.\u201d\n-Prime Minister Holness\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThere is a direct link between climate change and many of the local challenges we are experiencing. That is the message from Prime Minister Andrew Holness. He is encouraging Jamaicans to pay closer attention to the far-reaching effects of climate change and act responsibly at the local level to lessen the impact of the issues we face.\nSpeaking on the importance of responding to climate change, Prime Minister Holness implored Jamaicans to adopt a more global perspective in their daily lives.\n\u201cMany Jamaicans exist from day-to-day, and they have no clue about the global changes that are taking place around them. They only have to deal with the problems that they face daily. You cannot just be a local citizen. You are a citizen of the entire world, and there are some issues that affect the entire world that impact your local circumstances,\u201d Prime Minister Holness stated.\nThe Prime Minister also noted the increasing frequency of major weather events in Jamaica and encouraged citizens to recognize the signs of climate change. \u201cEvery Jamaican citizen must now pay attention to this thing called climate change. Pay attention to the frequency of major weather events happening in your country. Pay attention to the hotter times that you are experiencing on a daily basis.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cAlmost every year for the last five years, Jamaica has had a serious weather event. Whether it is tropical storm Eta, tropical storm Zeta, or heavy floods. So not only are you going to have multiple crises, you\u2019re going to have them more frequently.\u201d\nThe Prime Minister explained the interconnected nature of global and local issues, noting how climate change worsens health and other problems.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Holness also stressed the need for personal responsibility in tackling these challenges. He highlighted the issue of improper waste disposal and its impact on local communities, particularly in terms of vector-borne diseases.\n\u201cWe cannot continue like this as a people. No amount of budget allocation can single-handedly solve this problem. When plastics and other garbage get into the earthen drains, they prevent the water from moving through. So it\u2019s not just the trees that block the drain. It is the plastics and other waste. We have to take some responsibility.\u201d\nFurthermore, the Prime Minister called on Jamaicans to adopt better waste management practices to reduce the breeding of mosquitoes and other vectors.\n\u201cIf you have to store water at home, cover water containers for your drinking and domestic purposes. We must understand that as the time gets hotter, the conditions for breeding mosquitoes and other vectors improve. Those conditions are what they like, and so you\u2019re going to get more mosquitoes. You cannot always blame the government and the National Solid Waste Management Authority; you have to take some personal responsibility.\u201d\nPrime Minister Holness is therefore appealing for behavioural change and increased awareness of global changes.\n\u201cI\u2019m using this platform to appeal to all of Jamaica to understand that there are some global changes happening that you need to get in tune with and change your behaviour in order to have an impact on the conditions that these global changes create in your local community. The government is doing its part as much as it can from the economy that you create. Whatever resources we get, we allocate them to the problems as best as possible, and we are allocating them in smart ways. We are doing the things that build our resilience and our capabilities to respond to crises.\u201d\nThe Prime Minister was speaking on Wednesday (July 24) at the launch of the National Clean-up Program in Portmore, St. Catherine.",

        "content": "title: Landslide toll hits 160 as rain hampers rescue work in India\u2019s Kerala \n content: Relentless downpours and howling winds hampered Wednesday\u2019s search for survivors of landslides that struck Indian tea plantations and killed at least 160 people, most believed to be labourers and their families.\nDays of torrential monsoon rains have battered the southern coastal state of Kerala, with blocked roads into the Wayanad district disaster area complicating relief efforts.\nHeavy rain in Kerala, one of India\u2019s most attractive tourist destinations, led to the landslides early on Tuesday, sending torrents of mud, water and tumbling boulders downhill and burying or sweeping people away to their deaths as they slept.\nSenior police officer M.R. Ajith Kumar told AFP that around 500 people had been rescued since successive landslides struck before dawn on Tuesday.\n\u201cSo far we have got more than 150 bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cStill large areas are to be explored and searched to find out whether live people are there or not.\u201d\nThe local Asianet news TV channel put the death toll at 177.\nIt was the worst disaster in the state since deadly floods in 2018. Experts said the area had been receiving heavy rain in the last two weeks which had softened the soil and that extremely heavy rainfall on Monday triggered the landslides.\nThe only bridge connecting the worst-hit villages of Chooralmala and Mundakkai was washed away, forcing rescue teams to carry bodies on stretchers out of the disaster zone using a makeshift zipline erected over raging flood waters.\nSeveral people who managed to flee the initial impact of the landslides found themselves caught in a nearby river that had burst its banks, volunteer rescuer Arun Dev told AFP at a hospital treating survivors.\n\u201cThose who escaped were swept away along with houses, temples and schools,\u201d he said.\nNear the site where the bridge was washed away, a land excavator was slowly removing trees and boulders from a mound of debris. Rescue workers in raincoats were making their way carefully through slush and rocks, under steady rain.\n\u201cWe are quite sure there are multiple bodies here,\u201d said Hamsa T A, a fire and rescue worker, pointing to the debris. \u201cThere were many houses here, people living inside have been missing.\u201d\nThe landslides were mostly on the upper slopes of hills which then cascaded to the valley below, M R Ajith Kumar, a top state police officer, told Reuters.\n\u201cFocus right now is to search the entire uphill area for stranded people and recover as many bodies (as possible),\u201d he said.\nIndian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who until recently represented Wayanad in parliament, said he had been unable to go through with a planned visit to the disaster.\n\u201cDue to incessant rains and adverse weather conditions we have been informed by authorities that we will not be able to land,\u201d he said in a post on social media platform X.\n\u201cOur thoughts are with the people of Wayanad at this difficult time,\u201d he added.\nWarming Arabian Sea\nNearly 350 of the 400 registered houses in the affected region have been damaged, Asianet TV reported, citing district officials.\nAfter a day of extremely heavy rainfall that hampered rescue operations, the weather department expects some respite on Wednesday, although the area is likely to receive rain through the day.\nThe Indian Navy said its disaster relief team had reached the area on Tuesday night and search and rescue helicopters were deployed early on Wednesday but \u201cadverse weather conditions due to incessant rains\u201d posed challenges.\nIndia has witnessed extreme weather conditions in recent years, from torrential rain and floods to droughts and cyclones, blamed by some experts on climate change.\nThe region hit by the landslide was forecast to get 204 millimetres of rainfall but ended up getting 572mm over a period of 48 hours, Kerala\u2019s chief minister said on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe Arabian Sea is warming at a higher rate compared to other regions and sending more evaporation into the atmosphere, making the region a hotspot for deep convective clouds,\u201d said S Abhilash, head of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research at Kerala\u2019s Cochin University of Science and Technology.\n\u201cDeep developed clouds in the southeast Arabian Sea region were carried by winds towards land and produced this havoc,\u201d he told Reuters.",

        "content": "title: Cyclone Remal: Two months on, hard-hit communities struggling to get by and rebuild \n content: Two months after Cyclone Remal, people are still in shock from the devastation the storm played on their lives. \u2018I am literally living in a kind of hell,\u201d says one man, a carpenter who lost the home be built with his own hands. \u2018There is a temporary cooking station at the back of my house, but nothing to eat.\u2019\nThe water from Cyclone Remal was already up to their necks when 35-year-old Tanya and her husband had to evacuated their home and go to a storm shelter.\n\u201cMy house was destroyed and now I live with my in-laws nearby,\u201d she says. \u201cI have three children. Two daughters and a son, and taking care of another boy as well; four children in total. All my children were born in our house, that is now destroyed.\u201d\nTanya\u2019s story is shared by thousands whose lives were dramatically changed when the cyclone made landfall near the Mongla and Khepupara coasts in Bangladesh and West Bengal of India on 26 May, 2024.\nAccording to Bangladesh\u2019s Department of Disaster Management (DDM), under the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), about 4.6 million people were affected by Cyclone Remal in 19 districts.\nMore than 807,000 people were evacuated to 9,424 evacuation shelters across 19 districts. Over 173,000 houses were damaged, including 40,338 that were completely uninhabitable. Now families are struggling to get back on their feet.\n\u201cBefore the cyclone and flooding, my husband did daily tasks to help other families in the area \u2014 with things like farming,\u201d Tanya continues. \u201cHe worked as hired support for other people in the village who need deliveries.\n\u201cOptions are not that many here for people who need to do day-to-day work for survival. So, my husband was already struggling beforehand. Now it\u2019s worse, because everybody in the community is affected. If there is work, we can eat. Otherwise, we don\u2019t get food.\u201d\nThe storm also had a devastating impact on food security and livelihoods. More than 50,000 fishing farms were destroyed, and more than 80,000 hectares cultivable land were inundated, by the high winds, waves and storm surges of cyclone Remal.\nIn the wake of the storm, the Bangladesh Red Crescent immediately began providing emergency food through its eight coastal branching, distributing a seven-day food package to 50,000 people. They also provided hygiene kits, tarpaulins and sleeping mats, among other things.\nAccess to clean water is also critical, as over 20,000 water points and more than 134,000 latrines were damaged by the storm. In response, two mobile water treatment plants (reverse osmosis) for desalination were deployed in Khulna and Satkhira districts, distributing safe drinking water to more than 5,000 households.\nTwo Mobile Medical Teams were also mobilized, providing primary healthcare services and psychosocial support.\nThe immediate resonse was supported by a 1 million Swiss Franc allocation from the IFRC\u2019s Disaster Response Emergency Fund (IFRC-DREF) and an emergency appeal that was launched by the IFRC seeking 12.5 million Swiss Francs to support ongoing operations.\nIn the coming months, the focus will be on building back livelihoods and shelters. For many, the storm took away their single most important life investment: their homes.\nIn the case of 65-year-old Yunus, a husband and father of two the storm took away the home he had been building and developing over ten years with his own hands.\nSince his family came back from the evacuation shelters to find their house destroyed and belongings gone, Yunus\u2019 wife has been in complete shock and has been crying most of the time.\n\u201cWe have lived like this, with cyclones for years, so we thought that this would be a \u2018normal\u2019 one,\u201d said Yunus.\u201cWe went to the shelter in a hurry, and we didn\u2019t have the chance to protect anything. At 3 am I escaped from the shelter to see what was happening here, and I saw that everything was gone. The road was gone, and the house was covered in water.\"\n\"I remained in the shelter for days because I literally could not return to my house. There was still a small rice paddy, but all the rice was gone. I got some chicken and hens as food support.\u201d\n\u201cI am literally living in a kind of hell. There is a temporary cooking station at the back of my house, but nothing to eat.\u201d\n\u201cYesterday I built a new small area to sleep in, because it is not possible to live in our destroyed house. The remains of it are tilted and full of loose pieces of wood and aluminum; it is dangerous to be inside. So, I am building a new temporary place for us to sleep in as soon as possible.\"\nStory by Camilla Bruun Simonsen\nEditing by Rachel Punitha",

The mother, identified as Tanuja, also fell inside while trying to rescue her son.\nTwo more people died on Wednesday, including one in a house collapse, reported India Today. A 12-year-old boy died from electrocution while he was returning home from tuition. Police have registered a case and are investigating the matter.\nIn the neighbouring satellite township of Gurugram, at least three people were electrocuted to death by a live wire submerged in a waterlogged area.\nIn Greater Noida, two people died due to a wall collapse.\nFlight operations have also been hit, with diversion of at least 10 flights heading to the national capital, reported CNN-IBN. The national capital region encompasses Delhi and several districts surrounding it from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.\nVisuals from ANI news agency showed flooding in the northern part of the city where three students drowned in a flooded basement last week.\nPrime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party found itself in the line of fire, after opposition parliamentarians raised concerns about a section of a leaking roof in the newly inaugurated parliament building.\nThe building, constructed as part of the government\u2019s larger Central Vista redevelopment project, was inaugurated by Mr Modi on 28 May last year with both the Houses shifted to the new premises on 19 September.\nCongress parliamentarian Manickam Tagore submitted an adjournment motion of the ongoing parliamentary session, seeking formation of special committee to inspect the \u201ccauses of the leaks, evaluate the design and materials, and recommend necessary repairs\u201d.\nMeanwhile, at least 11 people died after heavy rain lashed various parts of northern India and more than 250 people were missing after downpours in the Himalayas, including people stranded on a famous pilgrimage route.\nIMD recorded 183mm (seven inches) of rain in the past 24 hours in the famous tourist destination of Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh.\nMore than 50 people were missing after heavy rain over state capital Shimla and surrounding regions, chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said in a post on X, adding that rescue operations were ongoing.\nTwo people died after a barrage in a power project was breached, obstructing connectivity in the region, state revenue minister Jagat Singh Negi told news agency ANI.\nIndian Express newspaper reported that four people were killed after a cloudburst in the state of Uttarakhand and 200 pilgrims were stranded after rain washed away a part of their walking path.\nTorrential rains, which, along with unabated construction have frequently triggered deadly flash floods and landslides in the mountains of India and neighbouring Pakistan and Nepal over the past few years, have been attributed to climate change.\nIn the south, hopes of finding survivors began to fade as hundreds of rescuers worked through slush and rocks and pulled out bodies from debris in the hills of Kerala state, a day after 167 people were killed in monsoon landslides.\nSteady rain that intensified as the day progressed and the rising water level in a local river hampered the rescue, with a temporary bridge built to connect the worst affected area of Mundakkai being washed away.\nThe weather department has forecast more heavy rain over the next 24 hours, Kerala\u2019s chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said and urged people to be on \u201chigh alert\u201d.\nHeavy rain in Kerala, one of India\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, led to the landslides in its Wayanad district early on Tuesday, sending torrents of mud, water and tumbling boulders downhill and burying or sweeping people to their deaths as they slept. Experts said the area had received heavy rain in the last two weeks that softened the soil.\nExtremely heavy rainfall on Monday then triggered the landslides. Nearly 1,600 people have been rescued from the hillside villages and tea and cardamom estates, authorities said.\nAdditional reporting from agencies",

However, the gushing soil, gravel and rock reached the town of Chooralmala, 6km (3.7 miles) away.\n\u201cThe landslides happened at the top and then affected the lower valley areas where people were staying. Focus right now is to search the entire uphill area for stranded people and recover as many bodies [as possible],\u201d MR Ajith Kumar, a state law and order official, told the Reuters news agency.\nMore than a dozen bodies were found overnight, said police officer Aijaz, who uses one name, as over 300 rescuers worked to pull out people stuck under mud and debris, but their efforts were hampered by extremely heavy rainfall, blocked roads and unstable terrain.\nNearly 350 of the 400 registered houses in the affected region have been damaged, Kerala\u2019s Asianet TV channel reported, citing district officials.\nThe first landslide occurred at 2am on Tuesday (20:30 GMT on Monday), followed by another two hours later.\nLocal media reported that most of the victims were tea estate workers. Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded.\nVehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Local TV news channels also aired phone calls of stranded people asking for help.\nAfter a day of hampered rescue operations, the weather department expects some respite on Wednesday, although the area is likely to receive rain through the day.\nAt least 572mm (22.5 inches) of rain fell in the two days leading up to the landslide, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement.\nSeveral areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, were isolated, and roads were washed away causing immense damage to homes, said Vijayan in a statement released by his office.\n\u201cEfforts to locate missing persons continue with all available resources,\u201d the statement said, adding that more than 3,000 people have been moved to relief camps and the government is ensuring the delivery of food and essential items there.\nIn a post on social media platform X on Tuesday night, Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who until recently represented Wayanad in Parliament, said he had been unable to visit the disaster area.\n\u201cDue to incessant rains and adverse weather conditions we have been informed by authorities that we will not be able to land,\u201d he said. \u201cOur thoughts are with the people of Wayanad at this difficult time.\u201d\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said he was \u201cdistressed by the landslides\u201d and announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,388) to the victims\u2019 families.\nMonsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are vital for agriculture and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for the region\u2019s two billion people.\nBut they also bring destruction in the form of landslides and floods. The number of fatal floods and landslides has increased in recent years, and experts say climate change is exacerbating the problem.\n\u201cEvents like landslides, they are part of these climate change-triggered heavy rainfall disasters,\u201d Kartiki Negi of Indian environment think tank Climate Trends told the AFP news agency.\n\u201cIndia will continue to see more and more of these kinds of impacts in the future,\u201d she added.\nDamming, deforestation and development projects in India have also exacerbated the human toll.\nIntense monsoon storms battered India this month, flooding parts of the financial capital Mumbai, while lightning in the eastern state of Bihar killed at least 10 people.\nNearly 500 people were killed around Kerala in 2018 during the worst flooding to hit the state in almost a century.",

        "content": "title: Protests after students drown in Rau's IAS Study Circle building \n content: Anger after students drown in Delhi building basement\nThe drowning of three students in the basement of an exam coaching centre in India's capital Delhi has sparked anger and protests.\nThe students, all in their 20s, died on Saturday night after getting trapped in the flooded basement where they were studying.\nPolice have arrested seven people, including the owner of the institute, and registered cases against them for causing death by negligence.\nThe institute, Rau's IAS Study Circle, is one among several in the capital where thousand of students enrol to prepare for tough national exams.\nThe three victims - Shreya Yadav, Tanya Soni and Nivin Dalwin - were studying for India's Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams, which decide who becomes a civil servant, a much-coveted government job in India.\nBut many of these institutes, which are run out of cramped buildings in residential neighbourhoods, are accused of routinely flouting safety norms.\nSince Saturday, authorities in Delhi have sealed about a dozen coaching centres in the area for holding classes illegally in their basements.\nThe incident has also triggered a political row between the Delhi government and federal authorities, with both sides accusing the other of negligence.\nDelhi is a federally-administered territory and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-run local government does not have full administrative powers.\nHundreds of students have held protests around the area, accusing the administration of not doing its duty and ignoring complaints.\nThe tragedy unfolded on Saturday evening, after the capital had received heavy rains through the day.\nDelhi's fire department received a call around 19:00 local time (14:30 GMT) about water entering the basement of the coaching centre in Old Rajinder Nagar.\nThe institute operated a library and reading room in the basement - illegally, government officials later said - and around three dozen students and some staff members were inside at the time.\nSome students have told media that a gate at the entrance of the coaching centre collapsed, causing water accumulated on the road to rush in. But other reports said that a nearby drain burst due to heavy rains, resulting in a deluge.\nWitnesses said the basement flooded quickly, giving people little time to escape. While some managed to do so, others had to be rescued by the authorities.\nIt isn't clear what caused the three students to get trapped inside the basement.\nA student named Rajan (who used only one name) told BBC Hindi that days before the incident, the doors of the basement library had been replaced with ones that had a biometric system.\n\"It seems that due to water-logging, the biometric system failed and people could not get out,\" he alleged.\nOfficials from the institute have not addressed this allegation. In a statement, Rau's IAS Study Circle said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the deaths and was \"co-operating fully\" with the investigation.\nThe bodies of the three students were recovered by divers who searched the basement for several hours.\nAuthorities said the coaching centre only had permission to use the basement as a storeroom and for parking, and that the library was run illegally.\nThey also said that drains in the area had been clogged by silt, which caused water to overflow on the road.\nOn Sunday, several students studying for the UPSC exam - held protests demanding that strict action be taken against those responsible for Saturday's tragedy. They also criticised poor infrastructure in the capital.\nVikram (who gave only one name) told BBC Hindi that aspirants paid hundreds of thousands of rupees in coaching fees and rent.\n\"But what are you giving us? Death,\" he said.\nSeveral others recalled an incident last year when a fire broke out at a UPSC coaching centre in Mukherjee Nagar in Delhi. Videos showed students smashing windows and rappelling down the building using wires and ropes. Many students sustained burn injuries.\nSaturday's incident has sparked a row between Delhi's governing Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led federal government.\nThe BJP has blamed the AAP for not carrying out de-silting of drains and for the poor condition of roads. The AAP has accused Delhi's lieutenant governor - who is appointed by the federal government - for not taking action against erring officials and claimed that bureaucrats are not following orders from ministers.\nAAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was arrested in March on corruption allegations that he has denied - he was released for three weeks during the general election to campaign for his party but has otherwise remained in jail.\nThe incident was also discussed in parliament on Monday, with opposition lawmakers asking the federal government what steps it was taking to ensure that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. The BJP lawmakers criticised Delhi's AAP government in parliament and called for action against them for neglecting their duties towards the city residents.\nCongress MP Shashi Tharoor flagged \"widespread violations of building codes, fire safety and flood safety regulations\" in Delhi.",

The essence of the right of self-determination is that every nation and community has the right to freely decide its future as per the wishes of its masses without any discrimination, restriction and bondage. If this right is applicable to the entire international community, Kashmiris cannot and should not be made an exception and subjugated through foreign occupation indefinitely. India recognized and accepted the right of self-determination to Kashmiris as per abovementioned UNCIP resolutions yet denied its implementation for over seven decades.\nThe persistent Indian denial of a political solution to the Kashmir dispute created frustration and unrest among the people of Jammu and Kashmir. The frustration of Kashmiris was the result of years of Indian occupation, discrimination of Kashmiris in their own state, maltreatment of Kashmiris and denial of internal autonomy to the State, agreed through Article 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution. Resultantly, the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) revolted against the unlawful Indian rule and its unremitting exploitative policies in 1990. The popular slogan of \u2018Azadi\u2019 right of self-determination was the only demand of Kashmiri masses of IIOJK right from the beginning of this indigenous Kashmiri movement.\nThrough a brutal response to this UN mandated legal demand of Kashmiris of IIOJK, India made massive deployment of Army and paramilitary forces in entire IIOJK and started persecution of Kashmiris through various inhuman strategies. Mass arrests, torture in detention centres, custodial killings and indiscriminate firings over the peaceful Kashmiri demonstrations became the order of the day in IIOJK right from the start of 1990. As per estimates collected through various neutral sources, Indian brutal security forces have killed over 100,000 Kashmiris in IIOJK since 1990. Kashmiri leadership in IIOJK has frequently been targeted and killed either through direct attack or else while being in custody and house arrest under Indian security forces. The great Kashmir leader, Syed Ali Shah Gillani, the founding father of Kashmiris resistance movement died in September 2021 while being under house arrest for over five years.\nAs per records maintained by names, dates and places of occurrences, over 12,000 Kashmiri women have been subjected to rape and molestation, including gang rape and killing of women after rape. The Indian state provided blanket coverage for these inhuman acts through various laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), Public Safety Act (PSA), Geospatial Information Regulation Act and National Investigation Agency (NIA). These discriminatory laws granted the Indian Army and its paramilitary forces special provisions for arrest, illegal detention, torture and killing of Kashmiris with impunity. Such laws and the maltreatment of Kashmiris through the use of brutal force are internationally challengeable violations of international law, humanitarian declarations, covenants and dozens of international pacts.\nWhile India continued massive human rights violations in IIOJK through the deployment of its over 900,000 security forces, it ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir State illegally and unilaterally on August 5, 2019 by abrogating Article 370 and 35-A of its constitution. Besides, it also ended the statehood of the state by creating two union territories (Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh) under the Indian Union. In order to further its agenda of consolidation of its hold over the state, New Delhi introduced new Domicile Laws for Jammu and Kashmir in April 2020 (adaptation of State laws order-2020).\nUnder these laws, India has issued millions of domicile certificates to non-Kashmiri Hindus from various parts of India which is a grave violation of Fourth Geneva Convention. Article 49(6) of Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits occupying power(s) to transfer its own population into the occupied territory. Indeed, this is yet another aspect, covered under the blatant human rights violation.\nThe unremitting account of massive human rights violations of Indian security forces in IIOJK over the last three decades has added a humanitarian dimension to the prevailing political nature of Kashmir dispute. The humanitarian dimension of the dispute needs immediate attention of the international community and United Nations Organization. On January 18, 2022, A UK based law firm filed an appeal to the London\u2019s Metropolitan Police for the arrest of the then Indian Army Chief General Manoj and Indian Home Minister Amit Shah for undertaking massive human rights violations of Kashmiris in IIOJK. This legal appeal for the arrest of two top Indian government officials was lodged under the \u201cUniversal Jurisdiction\u201d. Indeed, Indian Army and its paramilitary forces have been undertaking massive human rights violation in IIOJK since 1990 through; direct killings, torture, kidnapping, extrajudicial killings as well as rape and sexual violence.\nWith over 900,000 Indian forces deployed, IIOJK has become a war zone. Therefore, besides the political settlement of the dispute, International humanitarian law (IHL) provides solid bases to resolve the dispute on a humanitarian basis. IHL is indeed a set of rules that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict in the war zone like IIOJK. Besides UNO, IHL lays out the responsibilities of states to protect the local population from all dimensions: their basic civil rights, their freedom and security and, above all, their right to self-determination. The Kashmir dispute needs to be addressed on the basis of IHL. UN and major powers must constrain India to end its massive human rights violations in IIOJK which should also include stoppage of the demographic changes and massive human rights violations.\n\u2014 The writer is Professor of Politics and IR at International Islamic University, Islamabad.",

The death toll is expected to rise as many people are still missing.\n\nHuge boulders rolled down the hills, hindering the rescue workers' path. Despite heavy rains, rescue workers continued shifting the dead and injured into ambulances.\n\nSeveral hilly regions in Wayanad district, including Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Attamala, and Noolpuzha villages, have been affected by a series of landslides, with the most significant impact observed in Mundakai and Chooralmala.\n\nChooralmala, which is not typically vulnerable to landslides and is 6 km away from the landslide epicenter, experienced 578mm of rainfall in the 48 hours preceding the landslide, significantly more than predicted.\n\nTo date, 93 bodies have been found, and 128 people have been hospitalized due to injuries. Out of the 93 bodies, 34 have been identified, and 18 have been handed over to their families after post- mortem examinations.\n\nSixteen bodies were found in Pothungal from the Chaliyar River.\n\nThe Iravahinji River is now flowing in two directions from its original course and Vellarmalla GVHSS is fully buried under clay and soil after the incident.\n\nRed alert has been issued for Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nWorst Affected Areas: Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Attamala, and Noolpuzha villages\n\nNumber of Causalities:\n\nHospitalised people:\n\nNo. of Relief Camps:\n\nInmates in Relief Camp :\n\nRescued people: Aroud 250\n\nElectricity damage: 03KM High tension line, 08 KM low tension line\n\nHouses Washed away: More than 150\n\nKerala Electricity Minister has directed the restoration of power connections in the landslide-affected areas of Chooralmala and Mundakkai as soon as possible. The Minister has instructed that power restoration efforts be focused on all areas except for seven transformers in the disaster-affected region, which serve about 1,400 consumers.\n\nThree kilometers of high-tension lines and eight kilometers of low-tension lines were damaged, with two transformers washed away and three transformers damaged. Currently, 350 families are without power in the area.\n\nRescued individuals from disaster-affected areas will be shifted to the nearest relief camps. Local self-government bodies have been instructed to provide clean drinking water, food, and other facilities to those in the camps and those isolated.\n\n250 people have been rescued so far and were shifted to temporary shelters\n---\nGOVERNMENT RESPONSES\n\nThe Kerala government has declared a state of mourning on July 30 and 31 due to the loss of life and property in Wayanad. Five ministers are camping in Wayanad focusing on coordinating the rescue operations in the affected areas. Forty-five relief camps have been set up in the Wayanad district, housing 3,069 people. In total, 118 relief camps have been established across Kerala, with 5,531 inmates. The Chief Minister has suggested all humanitarian agencies to coordinate with the district collector's office for humanitarian responses. With the heavy rainfall continuing, the IMD has scaled up the weather alert for the day in Kerala, placing half the state on red alert and warning of extremely heavy rainfall in eight districts, with four other districts on orange alert forecasting very heavy rainfall. The Food and Civil Supplies Department has launched steps to supply food grains and other essential supplies to relief camps for those displaced by the devastating landslides in Wayanad. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an ex-gratia of \u20b92 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased in the landslides. The Navy and Army have been deployed in the district for rescue operations. Tamil Nadu is sending a team of medical personnel and disaster response personnel to Kerala to aid in rescue and relief operations in Wayanad. A total of 329 fire and rescue officers, including 35 water rescue trainers and 85 Aapta Mitra personnel, have been deployed. Five teams of the NDRF are also in the district, with two teams from Bengaluru and one from the Kollam district. Helicopters have reached Calicut for rescue operations, but they have not been able to participate due to bad weather. The public can provide information to the 24-hour control room at the phone numbers 9497900402 and 0471 2721566. The control room operates under the direct supervision of the State police chief Drone team has been deployed from neighboring districts, and police dogs are also in the field to support search and rescue efforts. Additionally, specially trained army dogs have been requested to assist in the search and rescue operations. Additional forensic doctors from Calicut Medical College have been deployed to Wayanad for genetic examination of unidentified bodies. Food supplies are available in the affected areas, with ration shops and supply centers fully functional. The water authority has started delivering clean drinking water to the region, with two tankers carrying 2,000 liters. The NHM state mission director has been deployed in the district to coordinate local health activities. Temporary clinics have been set up in mosques and madrassas in Chooralmala, and a temporary hospital has been established in a polytechnic college. Doctors from various specialties, including surgery, orthopedics, and forensic departments, have been deployed from Kozhikode, Kannur, and Thrissur districts. A team of private hospital doctors is also on-site. Mortuary facilities will be increased, and mobile mortuary units will be utilized. Medicines and equipment are being delivered to hospitals in the district, and ambulances and rapid response units are being moved to the disaster-affected region.\n\nSource of Information Media, Social Media, Sphere India WhatsApp\n\nGroup Disclaimer: Sphere India makes every effort to verify the information contained in its Situation Reports.

That night, my husband and I, along with our three children, took turns bailing out the water,\u201d she said.\nNg\u1ea7n said, drawing from experience with previous heavy rains, she built a sandbag barrier in front of her house to prevent flooding.\nHowever, the downpour on the night of July 23 into the early hours of July 24 caused some sandbags to burst and water seeped through cracks in the walls, leading to flooding throughout her home.\nSimilarly, the heavy rain on July 23 also disrupted the lives of many residents in An Kh\u00e1nh urban area, Ho\u00e0i \u0110\u1ee9c District.\n|The basement of a house in An Kh\u00e1nh urban area is flooded after a heavy rain on July 24. \u2014 VNA/VNS Photo Tu\u1ea5n Anh|\nTr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Nguy\u00ean, a resident at a local apartment complex, likened his home to an island whenever there was heavy rain.\nNguy\u00ean said that on the evening of July 23, it took him three hours to travel from his office in C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y District to his home due to the heavy rain.\nUpon reaching his apartment complex, he found the area severely flooded, forcing him to park his car by the roadside and walk about a kilometre to his home.\nThe following morning, he got up early to wade to work, packing an extra set of clothes in his bag just in case he got wet.\nThe H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i\u2019s Department of Transport said there were currently 30 'black spots' in the city that flood whenever it rained heavily, leading to traffic congestion and impacting residents' daily activities.\nThe spots included Nguy\u1ec5n Khuy\u1ebfn Street, Hoa B\u1eb1ng Street, the Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u - L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t intersection, Minh Khai Street (at the foot of V\u0129nh Tuy Bridge) and Th\u0103ng Long Avenue.\nA representative from H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i Sewerage and Drainage Company Limited said due to the effects of typhoon Prapiroon, widespread rainfall occurred on the night of July 23 and the morning of July 24.\nRainfall measurements at 6am on July 24 ranged from 138mm to 295.8mm.\nThe extensive and prolonged heavy rainfall had caused water levels in rivers and lakes to rise, leading to numerous flood points in Long Bi\u00ean, C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y, T\u00e2y H\u1ed3, Thanh Xu\u00e2n, and H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng districts. Notably, on Th\u0103ng Long Avenue, underpasses were severely flooded, submerging many motorcycles and making travel difficult.\nCauses\nThe representative said the prolonged flooding in Th\u0103ng Long Avenue was due to the areas being lower lying compared to their surroundings.\nConsequently, during heavy rains, water flowed rapidly towards these low areas, causing localised flooding.\n\u0110\u00e0o Ng\u1ecdc Nghi\u00eam, vice president of the Vi\u1ec7t Nam Urban Development and Planning Association talked to Lao \u0111\u1ed9ng (Labour) online newspaper, explaining that the flooding was because the water drainage system in the area was not connected to the main drainage channels.\nAdditionally, the main drainage systems outside the urban areas lacked pumping stations, resulting in insufficient drainage capacity during heavy rains.\nNghi\u00eam said according to global best practices in flood prevention, about three to five per cent of land should be used as water retention lakes.\nHowever, H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i currently only had around two per cent of land used as reservoirs.\nAlthough the city had numerous drainage channels, many of them were blocked or were not used effectively.\nThe city was now divided into three drainage zones, consisting of the north of the city and the left and right banks of the \u0110\u00e1y River.\nHowever, local pumping stations to transfer water to main stations had not been fully established. Many pumping stations were still inadequate or yet to be built, he said.\nSolutions\nTherefore, Nghi\u00eam recommended that existing drainage projects be reviewed and adjusted.\nAdditionally, regular maintenance of sewers, channels and ditches was crucial, along with comprehensive research into the river systems flowing through the city.\nTo fix the situation, the city is implementing several projects, such as upgrading the Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Tr\u1ea1ch Pump Station in \u0110\u00f4ng Anh District and improving the drainage system in the Y\u00ean Ngh\u0129a Pump Station in H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng District.\nMoreover, numerous projects are in the planning stages, including the left bank of the Nhu\u1ec7 River drainage system, the H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng District drainage system on the right bank of the Nhu\u1ec7 River, the Gia Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng pumping station, the C\u1ef1 Kh\u1ed1i water retention lake and Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Thanh drainage channel in Long Bi\u00ean District.\nTr\u1ecbnh Ng\u1ecdc S\u01a1n, deputy general director of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i Sewerage and Drainage Company Limited said in the long term, the city needed to invest in drainage infrastructure according to the urban planning framework, including new pumping stations such as Nam Th\u0103ng Long and Ba X\u00e3 as well as water retention lakes like C\u1ed5 Nhu\u1ebf 1, C\u1ed5 Nhu\u1ebf 2 and Ph\u00fa \u0110\u00f4 to mitigate flooding in the area.\nIn particular, for Th\u0103ng Long Avenue, the company suggested constructing temporary pumping stations such as \u0110\u00eca S\u00e1o to lower water levels in local channels and \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e9p to pump water from the \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e9p and Trung Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng channels before, during and after heavy rains, to reduce the extent and duration of flooding.\nAdditionally, relevant agencies had to construct drainage infrastructure as planned, such as pumping stations of Li\u00ean M\u1ea1c, Li\u00ean Trung, Y\u00ean Th\u00e1i, \u0110\u00e0o Nguy\u00ean and Cao Vi\u00ean, along with 531ha of water retention lakes and developing a drainage system along the avenue to channel water to the \u0110\u00e1y River through the \u0110\u00e0o Nguy\u00ean pump station.\u2014 VNS",

        "content": "title: Fatwa and Gwadar incident \n content: THE situation in Pakistan is deeply troubling as the incompetence of politicians and civil administration has forced the army into handling sensitive ethnic, religious, cultural, and social conflicts, areas outside its training and primary purpose. The army is primarily trained to combat foreign enemies and assist the civilian government only when law and order are beyond civilian control. For example, during the Paris Olympics, over 10,000 military personnel provided security but returned to barracks after the event. In Pakistan, however, due to the persistent failures of political and civil leaders, the army is repeatedly called upon to manage conflicts that should be the civilian government\u2019s responsibility.\nDuring my over four decades of experience, I have frequently interacted with the Army Command when they were called to assist civilians. The army consistently argued that they should only be called upon in extreme circumstances. They emphasized that their military-grade weapons are unsuitable for use against their own citizens, which limits their effectiveness to that of the civilian government. While their presence and flag marches may initially intimidate the populace, this effect diminishes as people grow accustomed to the army\u2019s involvement in civilian matters.\nThe involvement of the army in civilian affairs, driven by the incompetence of politicians and the civil administration, has severely damaged its image. Visible and virulent movements against the army have emerged in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) in KP advocates for the rights of the Pashtun people, aiming to end extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and unlawful detentions, while demanding justice and human rights. In Balochistan, groups like the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Baloch Republican Army (BRA), Baloch Liberation Front (BLF), and United Baloch Army (UBA) engage in armed struggle and propaganda against the army, further complicating the situation. This standoff has led to numerous incidents of violence, including the recent clash in Gwadar where a protest by the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee turned violent, resulting in the death of one soldier and injuries to 16 others. The loss of life, whether of a protester or a soldier, is deeply painful for every Pakistani patriot, underscoring the urgent need for competent governance and peaceful resolution of conflicts.\nLike violent movements that should have no place in a democratic country, another deeply worrying phenomenon reflecting a serious fault line in our national fabric is the issuance of fatwas calling for the death of anyone contradicting the fatwa giver\u2019s religious philosophy. There has been a history of such illegal fatwas in Pakistan. In 2012, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan issued a fatwa against Malala Yousafzai for advocating girls\u2019 education, leading to an assassination attempt. In 2011, a fatwa was issued against Salman Taseer for criticizing blasphemy laws, resulting in his assassination. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy faced fatwas in 2016 for her documentary on honour killings. Militant groups like TTP issued fatwas against polio vaccinations, claiming they were a Western conspiracy, leading to attacks on health workers. The 1974 fatwa against Ahmadis declared them non-Muslims, resulting in severe persecution. The Women\u2019s Protection Bill in 2006 faced fatwas for attempting to protect women from domestic violence. Javed Ahmad Ghamidi faced threats and was forced to leave Pakistan in 2005 due to his progressive views. Judges involved in the 2018 acquittal of Asia Bibi faced death fatwas from extremist groups, and those who delivered the 2019 Faizabad Dharna verdict were similarly targeted. The latest incident involves a fatwa against Supreme Court Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa.\nThe Pakistan Army faces a two-pronged jeopardy, despite the unwavering dedication of its brave soldiers and officers who frequently embrace shahadat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to protect the country and its people from terrorists, criminals, and extremists. Instead of receiving the praise they rightly deserve, a virulent propaganda campaign has been unleashed against the army on social media and traditional media platforms. While this propaganda has failed to deter the armed forces from achieving their objectives, it negatively impacts overall morale. Therefore, it is imperative to address and reverse this situation promptly. In this context, the parliament should prioritize addressing the underlying fault lines within the country instead of wasting time on self-serving laws to protect itself from the judiciary or opposition parties. The parliament must investigate and understand the real reasons and factors that have transformed a large segment of society into separatist, insurgent, extremists, religious bigots, and intolerant individuals. These elements take pride in waging armed struggle against the army, burning religious symbols of minorities, lynching individuals accused of blasphemy, slaughtering those opposed to their religious views, and issuing fatwas to murder others without judicial process, all with impunity.\nInterestingly, the district administration, special branch, and other intelligence agencies monitor all gatherings as a standard operating procedure, compiling daily reports at the district, divisional, provincial, and national levels, which ultimately reach the Prime Minister\u2019s desk every morning. Ironically, neither the Prime Minister, the parliament, nor our so-called intellectual thinkers and philosophers have taken up the challenge to reverse the ever-increasing phenomena of separatism, extremism, bigotry, intolerance, and violent behavior. Due to this impunity, these elements have become emboldened to the point of issuing fatwas against high-ranking officials, including the army chief, the prime minister, judges, and now the chief justice.\nAs a nation, we must insulate our army from civilian affairs. Politicians and civil administration should step forward boldly to handle all internal political conflicts, such as the PTM and Baloch insurgency, taking full responsibility for their success and failure. Moreover, civilian leadership must recognize that fatwas, especially those that incite violence or are criminal in nature, including those related to incitement to violence, hate speech, and terrorism, have no official legal status. Those issuing these illegal decrees must be immediately brought to justice at the district level before such issues escalate to the national level.\n\u2014The writer is a former Press Secretary to the President.",

        "content": "title: Could scores of deaths in Kerala landslides have been avoided? \n content: Could scores of deaths in Kerala landslides have been avoided?\nLandslides in Wayanad killed over 300 people and wiped out entire villages\nSupport truly\nindependent journalism\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\nLouise Thomas\nEditor\nMore than 300 people were killed and entire villages wiped out after landslides caused by heavy rainfall struck Wayanad in the southern Indian state of Kerala earlier this week, sounding alarm all over the country about the growing frequency and intensity of such disasters.\nHeavy rainfall, flooding and landslides are common during South Asia\u2019s monsoon season from June through September, but they have grown more destructive in recent years, in large part because of human activities.\nKerala\u2019s case is illustrative. Though the occurance of the flooding and landslides was beyond human control, the extent of the disaster was not.\nThe first landslide hit Wayanad an hour past midnight on Tuesday. The villagers of Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala ran for their lives. Many of those who stayed were buried by landslides that followed one after the other until early dawn.\n\u201cWe thought the entire mountain was going to fall on us. We were fighting death that time,\u201d a villager identified only as Jayesh told India Today.\nThe proximate cause of the disaster was unrelenting monsoon rain. The Indian Meteorological Department said Wayanad had received 28cm of rain in the 24 hours before the landslides struck and destroyed critical infrastructure like roads, bridges and power lines along with homes and crops.\nKerala is no stranger to intense moonsoon rainfall given its geography, flanked by the Arabian Sea to the west and the Western Ghats mountain range to the east. But this monsoon has been particularly severe, leading to swollen rivers, landslides and extensive flooding in the southern state as also elsewhere in the country.\nStudies have shown that the climate crisis is making the monsoon particularly harsh, with rain falling in short and heavy bursts.\n\"Climate change is drastically altering rainfall patterns in the region,\" said Dr Akshay Deoras, a researcher at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science.\n\u201cWhat was once a predictable monsoon season has become increasingly erratic, with long dry spells followed by sudden, intense downpours.\"\nThis shift heightens the risk of floods and makes landslides more likely as dry soils are unable to absorb heavy rains effectively, he explained.\nThe rainfall is also not distributed equally. While rainfall in Kerala\u2019s nothern Kannur district was 21 per cent above average between 1 June and 30 July, it was 14 per cent below average in neighbouring Wayanad and nearly 25 per cent below average in Idukki and Ernakulam.\n\u201cThe co-occurence of two extreme scenarios, landslides and rainfall deficit, in the same state reflects a strong spatial variability in this year\u2019s monsoon rainfall,\u201d Dr Deoras said.\n\u201cThe expectation is that such a pattern would become more intense in the future if global warming continues.\u201d\nKerala was devastated by Cyclone Ockhi in 2017 and again by massive floods in 2018, among the worst in its history.\nWhat Dr Deoras described isn\u2019t unique to Kerala. It\u2019s a global phenomenon driven by rising temperatures and shifting climate patterns.\nThe Indian Ocean, a critical driver of the region's climate, has warmed significantly, nearly 1.5C, since the industrial era began. This warming has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including the kind of heavy rains that contributed to Kerala's recent disaster, experts said.\nHuman activities also played a crucial role in amplifying the disaster's impact.\nDeforestation, unplanned urban development and poor land-use practices have significantly compromised the region's natural defenses.\nAs India has sought to develop economically over the past few decades, it has built roads, bridges and mines in hilly regions. From the Himalayas in the north to the Western Ghats in the south, however, these mountainous areas are fragile.\nMore than half of the Western Ghats mountain range is at risk of landslides, a government panel found and called for it to be declared ecologically sensitive with the most sensitive regions protected from any kind of human activity.\nAccording to a 2021 study, 56 per cent of Kerala\u2019s landslides occurred in plantation areas. The plantations often stand where lush forests once thrived.\nWayanad lost 62 per cent of its forest cover between 1950 and 2018, according to a study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.\nStudies have also suggested that a changing climate, a stronger monsoon in the past two decades and land cover changes have contributed to the increased frequency of the \u201cheavy rainfall events\u201d.\nSuch ecological warnings very rarely alter India\u2019s construction plans.\n\"We see roads being constructed and widened without proper measures such as slope stability, retaining walls, or adequate drainage systems,\" said professor YP Sundriyal, head of geology at the HNB Garhwal University.\n\"Such infrastructure projects, carried out without considering the region's geological sensitivity, can exacerbate the risk of landslides.\"\nKerala has witnessed a construction boom in the last few decades, driven by rapid urbanisation and a growing population, that has often ignored ecological considerations. Buildings have been erected in areas prone to floods and landslides, with insufficient regard for safety regulations. The result is a landscape where natural disasters can have disproportionately severe consequences.\nOne of the most vital components of disaster management is the implementation of effective early warning systems. While Kerala has made strides in this area, significant gaps remain. Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, emphasized the need for localised early warning systems.\n\"Landslide-prone areas are mapped and known, yet timely evacuation and preventive measures are often lacking,\" he said. \"We need to monitor rainfall data in these hotspots and prepare targeted early warning systems to save lives and livelihoods.\"\nThe disaster in Wayanad revealed shortcomings in the state's ability to communicate risks and coordinate evacuation. In some cases, people were unaware of imminent danger or reluctant to leave because of the lack of clear and timely information.\nIn any case, the response to the disaster has got mired in politicking. India\u2019s home minister Amit Shah said in the parliament that the Kerala government did not gauge the severity of the situation accurately despite the federal government despatching nine National Disaster Response Force teams to the state on 23 July.\n\u201cHad those blaming the government read the warnings, the situation would have been different,\u201d he declared.\nThe Kerala government denied they were warned. \u201cNone of the agencies had issued a red alert for Wayanad ahead of the July 30 landslides,\u201d it said.\nIf disasters like this are to be avoided, experts said, urgent mitigation measures need to be implemented.\n\"Kerala has not been witnessing typical monsoon rains and has been struggling to achieve its average rainfall,\" said Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet Weather.\n\"Despite these heavy showers, it is yet to surpass its average rainfall so far. The rise in air and ocean temperatures has led to a drastic increase in moisture, making the atmosphere unstable.\"\nThis instability underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy involving both mitigation and adaptation measures.\n\"Several measures can be taken to mitigate the impact of landslides and excessive rains linked to climate change,\u201d Mr Palawat said.\n\u201cImplementing robust early warning systems through enhanced weather forecasting technologies can provide timely alerts, enabling residents to evacuate and prepare.\"",

hundreds of people feared trapped. As rescue operators recover body parts from the rivers and mud, it is difficult to ascertain the exact number of people killed in the tragedy. Around 400 families have been cut off due to a bridge collapse in Chooralamala Town. IMD has issued a red alert for extremely heavy rainfall in eight districts of Kerala for the next 24 hours, with a warning of continued heavy rainfall in the days that follow. Relief camps were started at Meppadi School, Elavayal Anganwady, and St. Sebastian's Church Community Hall Chooralmala. | Image Source: IMD       |         |                                                                                                                |         |\n|  1 | \uf0b7 \uf0b7 \uf0b7     | The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has deployed the Fireforce and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team.
