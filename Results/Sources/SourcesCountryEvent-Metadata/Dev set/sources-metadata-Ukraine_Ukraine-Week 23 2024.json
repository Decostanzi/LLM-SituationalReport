Considering an ambitious 10-year plan by the Ukrainian government and the international community, it will cost over USD 486 billion to fund reconstruction efforts (World Bank, 2024). Although devastating, this juncture can be a watershed moment for Ukrainian society to \u201cbuild back better.\u201d\nUkraine aims to capitalize upon its reconstruction to transform its economy and society to become climate resilient and inclusive. However, sustainable efforts may not seem a priority to many in the context of the ongoing war. With so much unpredictability, added costs, and long payback periods, sustainable measures may not seem feasible.\nNevertheless, this does not have to be the case. Learning from prior post-disaster recoveries, planning at the European Union (EU) and national levels can synchronize to effectively allocate resources that maximize the economic and sustainable impacts of reconstruction.This brief particularly investigates the pragmatic implementation of energy-efficiency measures in residential buildings\u2014a tangible topic ready to be implemented during and after the war.",

Presentation: Gender, disability, inclusion, displacement and humanitarian needs: What is the Multi-sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) data saying? David Madinger, Impact Initiative, IMPACT. Mr Madinger represented the results of the 2023 Multi-sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) based on 13,332 households\u2019 interviews, using mixed face-to-face and computer assisted telephone interviews. The limitation of the assessment: The MSNA may not have captured intra household dynamics, such as those that may exist between men, women, boys, and girls within a single household. This assessment highlights the multifaceted challenges faced by various demographic groups in Ukraine, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions addressing these diverse challenges. Findings demonstrate that while head of household gender is important, it is not the only factor driving needs. The intersection of head of household gender with other vulnerabilities, seem to aggravate households\u2019 level of need. Humanitarian actors should pay particular attention to older people. Households that consist only of people aged over 60 years old express higher need of humanitarian assistance, yet they are less likely to report receiving aid than general population. Single female-headed households with at least one child were found to be in a particularly vulnerable position, especially regarding Livelihoods.",

Less attention, however, is paid to other sectors. Particularly, the fruit and vegetable, dairy, poultry, and honey sectors. Among the findings, are the impact of labour shortages as a significant factor curtailing production. Investments to adapt agricultural equipment for use by persons with disabilities (PWDs) could mitigate these shortages and lower unemployment among PWDs.\nThe destruction of infrastructure being another challenging factor for production in the wake of war. Among the solution examined are targeted activities to revitalize irrigation systems could increase vegetable and fruit production, especially in areas affected by the Kakhovka Dam's destruction in 2023.

The winter season poses increased vulnerabilities for both refugees and Moldovan citizens due to elevated living costs, primarily attributed to additional heating expenses. Severe weather conditions can create additional obstacles to accessing services and community life for specific groups, notably older persons, individuals with disabilities, and single-headed households with a high dependency ratio.\nAccording to UNHCR's Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) of Multipurpose Cash Assistance, despite sustained humanitarian efforts, substantial needs persist among the refugee population. Only 9 per cent of refugees can independently cover more than half of their basic needs, highlighting the ongoing necessity for humanitarian support.\nThese findings align with other studies, such as ACTED's Winter Assessment and REACH's Rental Market Assessment, which underscore that most refugee households rely on unsustainable income sources, including humanitarian aid.\nFrom September to December 2023, NRC received 371 requests for assistance through its hotline, specifically seeking hygiene and winterisation aid. Consequently, NRC is strategising to distribute hygiene and winterisation items to vulnerable refugees and host communities in the north region of Moldova before the next winter season.

Introduction\nIn the 2024 Ukraine Humanitarian Needs & Response Plan (HNRP), the Health Cluster identified 7.8 million individuals, including IDPs, returnees and non-displaced people in need of humanitarian health assistance including Mental Health support. Of these, 3.8 million people were targeted for assistance in the southern, eastern, and northern oblasts bordering the front line. Along with service delivery, and the procurement and distribution of medicines and supplies, cash and voucher assistance has been one of the accepted modalities of providing health assistance by health partners as stated in the HNRP.\nSince the launch of the HNRP in December 2023, air strikes have intensified in areas nearest the frontline and those bordering the Russian Federation. As of January 2024 the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has worsened significantly. Waves of attacks have had a devastating impact on the health and well-being of civilians, disrupting critical services for hundreds of thousands of people at the peak of winter. Throughout this period, areas originally targeted for humanitarian assistance in regions including Kharkivska, Khersonska, Kyivska, Mykolaivska, Odeska, and Zaporizhzhia have been heavily affected, and people continue struggling to access basic services, intensifying the demand for humanitarian aid.\nFrom Jan \u2013 Mar 2024, some 9,700 attacks were recorded. As of 09 April 2024, official records documented 31,366 civilian casualties.2 Ongoing attacks on health facilities and schools have had profound consequences, severely hindering access to essential healthcare other basic services. The May 2024 offensive in Donetska, Kharkivska, Khersonska, Sumska oblasts, has resulted in further displacement as civilians are fleeing to safety. As partners respond, the need to provide guidance on the use of Cash and Vouchers in health has become acute as a result of the increased vulnerability of the people in need",

Education Cluster activities in Sumska oblast aim at ensuring protecting children\u2019s wellbeing in the face of displacement, whilst ensuring children\u2019s right to education is protected amid the disruptions caused by the recent escalation of hostilities and evacuations. Key response focus: 1) provision of wellbeing and educational support in safe spaces for children who have been displaced or evacuated. 2) access to online learning for children amid intensified missile attacks and damage to educational infrastructure; 3)access to offline learning and wellbeing activities for both displaced and host community children if the security situation allows to enable these children to stay engaged with formal schooling and mitigate the potential learning losses resulting from the disruption to their education; 4) support for teachers who might be themselves affected by escalations (displaced) and face increased workload and challenges in supporting their students.\nNote on context! To preserve the lives of the population located in a 5-10 kilometer zone from the border f it is recommended that people be evacuated to safe, prepared places in accordance with the evacuation plans of the hromadas of Sumy, Okhtyrka, Konotop, and Shostka rayons or other oblasts. Voluntary early evacuation of the population from Bilopillia and Vorozhba is also underway. The local authorities are concerned about the growing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the event of a security situation deteriorating within a 20-30 km zone. With only 11 Collective Centers (CCs) in Sumy, there is insufficient accommodation for potential IDPs. Educational institutions offering online learning and having facilities suitable for housing IDPs are currently being evaluated. While long-term evacuees may stay in collective sites, the general trend in the oblast is that beneficiaries do not stay for long in CCs but aim to return home as long as it is safe. Hence, provision of support to children who transit from collective sites might only be a one-oftime activity.",

Hence, this analysis is not final and was produced solely for the purpose of informing operations.\nMethodology\nThe Health Resources and Services Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) is a system dedicated to monitoring the availability of critical health resources and services, thus playing a crucial role in identifying existing gaps and establishing intervention priorities. HeRAMS aims to provide decision-makers and health stakeholders with vital, up-to-date information.\nHeRAMS was launched in Ukraine by the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office in Ukraine and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in November 2022. Since its initiation, data has been consistently collected and updated by designated representatives at both the Departments of Health and health facility levels, focusing on all public health facilities that are accessible1 .\nAcknowledging potential factors that might compromise data quality, the HeRAMS team at WHO CO opted to undertake data verification. This process is aimed at assuring the quality of the entire HeRAMS data set. To ensure thorough data verification, IPSOS limited liability company, a third-party monitoring group, was engaged to carry out in-person verification visits.\nThe verification process is scheduled to be implemented in healthcare facilities that are selected randomly. The strategy includes verifying the data from 528 health facilities over a period of 12 months. This represents 30% of the health facilities targeted across all participating oblasts2 . The sample is stratified according to the type of health facility, including both Multi-Profile Health Facilities (MPHFs) and Primary Health Centers (PHCs).\nThe data collection process covers 14 domains and 114 indicators. This comprehensive approach includes questions regarding factors that impede functionality. The verification process identifies variations between data sets collected internally and those collected by an independent third party. \u2018Variation\u2019 in this context refers to any differences observed between the two sets of data.

The resulting deluge created unthinkable destruction, displacing thousands of residents and causing extensive damage. As we mark the one-year anniversary of this tragic event, HALO remains steadfast in its commitment to making the region safe for its inhabitants. However, the destruction of the dam presented us with temporary challenges.\nThe floodwaters that surged through the region not only ravaged homes and livelihoods but also reshaped the landscape in ways that continue to pose challenges to our operations. Eight HALO minefields in the neighbouring Mykolaiv region located along the Inhulets river were severely impacted by the floods. One of the most pressing issues was the displacement of UXO, a grim legacy of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These deadly remnants of war were displaced by the powerful currents and carried to new, often unpredictable locations.\nBELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WATER\nSome areas where HALO teams had been working in Mykolaiv oblast were severely impacted by the flooding which potentially contained new explosive threats. As a result, operations in the affected areas ceased for up to six months. Once it was possible to regain access to the areas, the teams conducted surface rechecks of previously cleared land and clearance work has since been able to resume.\nACCEPTING THE CHALLENGE\nIn addition to the physical challenges posed by the movement of UXO, there is a critical need for community education and awareness. Residents returning to their homes must be equipped with the knowledge to recognise and avoid potential hazards. HALO has expanded its Risk Education programmes, providing vital information and training to help communities stay safe amidst the ongoing clearance operations.\nOur deminers are working diligently, and our commitment to restoring safety and stability to the region is stronger than ever.\nCOMMITTED TO BRINGING SAFETY\nAs we reflect on the year since the Kakhovka Dam's destruction, it is clear that the road to recovery is long and complex. Nevertheless, the resilience of the affected communities and the dedication of our teams give us hope. HALO will continue to face challenges head-on, to ensure a safer future for all.",

The Board may also wish to reaffirm the importance of the Special Voluntary Fund and urge all development partners to contribute to it.\nI. Introduction\n1. In line with the Executive Board decision 2018/8, this report covers the organizational performance of the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme in 2023. Chapter II presents the annual results achieved against the results matrix of the Strategic Framework. Chapter III features UNV contributions to disability inclusion across the United Nations system. Chapter IV reflects on the mid-term review of the UNV Strategic Framework, and chapter V addresses the way forward.\n2. In the context of the world\u2019s polycrisis, 2023 was the most challenging year in recent history for UNV. Wars in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, political volatility across the Sahel, natural disasters and the drawdowns of United Nations peacekeeping operations required extra focus on the duty of care for UN Volunteers. Against this backdrop, UNV has nonetheless managed to provide scaled community-level volunteer action for sustainable development and grassroots-level response in emergencies. In addition to that, UNV promoted digital innovation and actively championed disability inclusion delivering results in 169 countries worldwide.",

By the end of August 2022, the count of individual Ukrainian refugees residing in Moldova had risen to 109,055. The winter season poses increased vulnerabilities for both refugees and Moldovan citizens due to elevated living costs, primarily attributed to additional heating expenses. Severe weather conditions can create additional obstacles to accessing services and community life for specific groups, notably older persons, individuals with disabilities, and single-headed households with a high dependency ratio.\nAccording to UNHCR's Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) of Multipurpose Cash Assistance, despite sustained humanitarian efforts, substantial needs persist among the refugee population. Only 9% of refugees can independently cover more than half of their basic needs, highlighting the ongoing necessity for humanitarian support.\nThese findings align with other studies, such as ACTED's Winter Assessment and REACH's Rental Market Assessment, which underscore that most refugee households rely on unsustainable income sources, including humanitarian aid.\nFrom September to December 2023, NRC received 371 requests for assistance through its hotline, specifically seeking Hygiene and Winterization aid. Consequently, NRC is strategizing to distribute Hygiene and Winterization items to vulnerable refugees and host communities in the north region of Moldova before the next winter season. First, NRC aims to assess the feasibility of meeting the needs through cash or voucher assistance in markets local to the target population.\nThe objective of this multi-sectoral market assessment:\n\u2022 understand whether the vendors in the north region of Moldova have the capacity to supply the hygiene and winterization items/goods to the targeted project participants\n\u2022 to determine if the markets in the targeted locations are accessible and safe for the NRC project participants, particularly those with diverse needs (e.g elderly people, people with mobility issues, etc).\n\u2022 identify risks, mitigation measures and potential market impact related to NRC programmes.\n\u2022 identify the appropriate transfer modality (Cash, paper voucher, E-voucher, or a combined modality)\n\u2022 identify market support needs and factors that needs to be considered during the project design and implementation.",

More than 2.2 million Ukrainians and third-country nationals (TCNs) in need of international protection have crossed the borders into Slovakia1, 80 per cent of whom are women and children.\nRefugees from Ukraine include older people, persons with disabilities, and those with urgent health care needs. The Government of Slovakia has generously kept the borders open, and national, district and local authorities have rapidly responded to the large numbers of arrivals. Local communities have taken a welcoming stance, with humanitarian actors, civil society, the private sector and community volunteers complementing the government-led efforts by providing significant support at border reception points and urban areas.\nDespite the favorable protection environment for refugees in the country, there remain major challenges in addressing areas such as access to longer-term accommodation, education, employment and livelihoods, and quality health care, especially for persons with disabilities or underlying serious health conditions. In addition, persons with specific needs may face additional barriers that prevent them from fully enjoying their rights and accessing the services they need. Persons with disabilities have the same basic needs as other refugees, but often face barriers to receiving the required assistance, or specific attention and targeted interventions. The situation is more challenging for refugee children with disabilities as they have limited access to education, health, child and social protection services. Their families require additional support in taking care of their child and access relevant support.\nWithin the framework of the Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for the situation in Ukraine and specifically within Slovakia\u2019s RRP, and as per recommendation of the Task Force2 focused on the rights of refugees with disabilities in the Protection and Inclusion Working Group, under the Refugee Coordination Forum (RCF), the Inter-agency Multisectoral Needs Assessment Team conducted an annex analysis to the Multi-Sector Needs Assessment3 (MSNA) conducted in Slovakia in 2023.\nBased on a focused analysis of the MSNA, this report presents an overview of the situation and needs of refugees from Ukraine with disabilities and their families who have fled to Slovakia due to the ongoing conflict in their country of origin. The analysis is presented across sectors, based on the MSNA 2023 collected information, and complemented with information from secondary sources, such as focus groups discussions and previous analysis.",

        "content": "title: Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024 in Berlin: Time for Women to Lead in Recovery \n content: Bonn, June 7, 2024 \u2013 In anticipation of the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024 in Berlin on June 11 and 12, the international humanitarian organization CARE continues to call for all reconstruction and recovery processes to ensure the participation of Ukrainian women and to promote gender equality. So far, the priorities and needs of women have hardly been considered in the discussions on reconstruction.\n\u201cThe meaningful and direct participation of women, girls and marginalized groups in all decision-making processes is key to forming a recovery agenda that is equitable, inclusive, gender-responsive, and truly effective,\u201d says Franziska J\u00f6rns, CARE Ukraine Deputy Country Director. \u201cWe need to protect and ensure equitable access to services they need and opportunities to rebuild their lives.\u201d\nGender equality has received very little attention in the previous two Ukraine Recovery Conferences in Lugano in 2022 and in London in 2023. It has also been largely absent from the various recovery and reconstruction plans that have been formulated by donor governments and international organizations. But Ukrainian women\u2019s rights and women-led organizations continue to drive efforts to meet the needs of the most vulnerable groups and provide vital assistance to survivors of gender-based violence. They are advocating for the rights of women and girls and are essential to increase the participation of those groups in processes and decisions that affect them now and will continue to impact them after the war. Support for these local organizations is therefore urgently needed to enable them to have a stronger voice in decision-making on reconstruction and recovery.\nWomen lawyers association JurFem is one of CARE\u2019s partner organizations participating in the recovery conference. JurFem works to develop gender-oriented approaches in the work of government and business, with a focus on combating violence against women.\nKhrystyna Kit, Chairwoman of JurFem, says: \u201cWithout a gender component, a just recovery is not possible. A key question is how to strengthen the rights of gender-based violence survivors in recovery. Psychological and medical support is critical but not enough. Survivors also need economic support and need to be included in social programmes. To make sure, these aspects are considered in discussions, decisions, and interventions, this is why we are here at the conference.\u201d\nCARE welcomes broader participation of Ukrainian civil society including women\u2019s rights and women-led organizations at Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024 as well as the intention to integrate gender perspectives throughout the conference. It has to be ensured that commitments are translated into concrete actions to advance gender equality in the reconstruction and recovery process and ensure that gender equality is prioritized consistently and sustainably.\nFor media inquiries, please contact: usa.media@care.org",

        "content": "title: Calls Go Unheard for Increased Aid in 2024 Budget \n content: The Council for International Development Aotearoa New Zealand (CID) has released its analysis of the 2024 New Zealand Budget, emphasizing the urgent need for increased Official Development Assistance (ODA) to tackle global challenges and fulfil New Zealand's international development and humanitarian aid obligations.\nWhile New Zealand\u2019s ODA reached a record high of $1.4 billion in 2023, or 0.34% of Gross National Income (GNI), this figure remains significantly below the United Nations target of 0.7%. An increase in ODA is essential for global stability, supporting initiatives in human rights, climate change, democracy, and sustainable development.\nGiven the escalating global crises, including severe food insecurity and ongoing conflicts such as Gaza and Ukraine, CID and member organisations has called for New Zealand to increase its ODA to 0.5% of GNI in the 2024 budget and develop a clear strategy to reach the 0.7% target by 2026.\n\"In these challenging times, it is tempting to turn inward and focus solely on domestic challenges,\" said CID Executive Director Peter Rudd at a select committee hearing at the parliament in May. \"However, as crises compound globally, the world looks to New Zealand to boldly live up to our international commitments. We have an important role to play both in the Pacific region and in the most urgent humanitarian crises around the world.\"\nGiven the escalating global crises, including severe food insecurity and ongoing conflicts such as Gaza and Ukraine, CID and member organisations have called for New Zealand to increase its ODA to 0.5% of GNI in the 2024 budget and develop a clear strategy to reach the 0.7% target by 2026. This call has not been met.\n\"While there is understandably increased pressure to address domestic cost-of-living issues, failing to deliver a firm commitment to ODA will only ultimately increase pressures on the New Zealand economy. Investing in increasing ODA expenditure is not only sound humanitarian policy but also good foreign policy and good economic policy. Addressing poverty is a significant factor in building resilience, maintaining independence, and improving security.\"\nAnalysis from the 2024 May budget announcement suggests that ODA faces a 35% reduction from 2023 levels, lowering New Zealand\u2019s contribution to levels not seen in the past decade. Even at the ODA\u2019s all-time high, New Zealand spends more on pothole repair than on international development and humanitarian aid.\nAdvocates from within this sector maintain that ODA investments are investments in the world we all want to live in. CID asserts that increasing ODA will help New Zealand address global hunger, combat climate change, promote peace and security, and support those affected by conflict and displacement.\nCID urges the New Zealand government to reconsider its budget choices to prioritize ODA investment and reaffirm the country\u2019s standing as a responsible global citizen.",

The Ministry of Interior is the lead body in Ukraine for addressing the issue of missing persons under special circumstances.\nUnder the agreement, the ICMP will support the efforts of the Ministry of Interior to collect DNA reference samples from Ukrainian families of the missing with their informed consent. DNA profiles from these samples can be matched in a dedicated database with DNA profiles taken from unidentified human remains. ICMP pioneered this mass identification method in the former Yugoslavia, where it has helped the authorities to account for more than three quarters of the 40,000 people who went missing in the conflicts of the 1990s.\nICMP will also provide training for personnel from the Expert Service of the Interior Ministry and higher education institutions that provide training to the police. In addition, it will help the Interior Ministry to build its capacity to manage data on missing persons that has been uploaded to the Unified Register and the Register of Human Genomic Information. This will include training in the use of the ICMP\u2019s Integrated Data Management System (iDMS).\nICMP, currently supports Ukraine in conducting large-scale human identifications at its DNA laboratories in The Hague, the Netherlands, and will continue to provide support to help Ukraine simultaneously build a largescale DNA testing capability that incorporates a DNA-led process of identifications. ICMP is also providing immediate support to the the DNA laboratories of the Expert Service and the Secretariat of the Commissioner for Persons who have Gone Missing under Special Circumstances, including equipment and specialized chemical supplies.\nIhor Klymenko stressed that Ministry of Interior will play an effective role for accounting for missing persons. \u201cAs a state we have obligation to account for the missing. This agreement is a first step in a long road of our cooperation. For families of the missing \u2013 this is a situation that is excruciating, so we have a moral obligation not to delay the action.\u201d\nSpeaking after today\u2019s signing ceremony, Kathryne Bomberger noted that, \u201cAn effective missing persons process requires scientific expertise and database technology, it has to be supported by a legislative and institutional framework, and it must have the support of families of the missing. Ukraine has many resources already in place and the authorities have made an enormous effort \u2013 under the most challenging conditions \u2013 to deploy these resources in a timely and effective way. There are gaps, however, and ICMP can help to fill these gaps. Our DNA laboratories in The Hague are already at the disposal of the Ukrainian authorities and we are expanding our training and technical support for Ukrainian partners.\u201d",

        "content": "title: Reconstructing Ukraine at war: The journey to prosperity starts now \n content: By John E. Herbst, Olga Khakova, and Charles Lichfield\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIntroduction\nSection 1: Summary of damages and the economic and financial situation\nSection 2: First steps toward building a reconstruction strategy\nSection 3: Steps to create a reconstruction-friendly ecosystem\nSection 4: The best opportunities for each economic sector\nSummary of recommendations\nConclusion\nIntroduction\nRebuilding the Ukrainian economy after years of war will be a monumental task that the country\u2019s allies and partners know they must assist. Helping Ukraine to prosper should be just as big a priority for those who believe Ukraine\u2019s victory is key to preventing further Russian aggression and sending a cautionary message to other autocrats around the world. While rarely dismissed out of hand, the reconstruction is intuitively seen by many in the West as secondary to the need to help Ukraine fight back against aggression. This is understandable, but neglects how reviving the Ukrainian economy\u2014and the government\u2019s cash flow\u2014also helps the war effort through additional funds, resources, and motivation.\nThe Ukrainian government is staffed by clever, innovative experts capable of expressing a clear vision of how to reach prosperity. But when the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center and GeoEconomics Center embarked on a weeklong research trip in February 2024 to meet them, Kyiv faced cash-flow problems and high uncertainty over future macrofinancial assistance, especially from the United States.\nThe situation has since improved, not least thanks to the US supplemental spending law that includes $10 billion of budgetary support\u2014but it\u2019s imperative that the West does not create doubts about its support for Ukraine again in 2025. The macrofinancial assistance meant to keep Ukraine\u2019s government functioning cannot finance the recovery as well. In addition to central government funds, a myriad of Western grants and loans need to be tied to individual projects. The innovative systems designed to implement this are up and running but not always used to their full potential.\nThis report provides a snapshot of the economic, societal, and energy-security situation on the ground, capturing key challenges and opportunities for supporting Ukraine\u2019s survival and building a more prosperous future. It also explores how the country can meaningfully contribute to Europe\u2019s economic growth and strategic autonomy at large through innovation, energy security, decarbonization, and diversified supply chains. While the situation is changing daily, these key takeaways will remain pertinent to reconstruction discussions for the foreseeable future.\nOur research is based on more than thirty meetings in Kyiv in February 2024. These included meetings with the most senior levels of the ministries in charge of reconstruction, influential think tanks, Western embassies, legislators in the Rada, journalists, and business leaders. These meetings were conducted under the Chatham House Rule. Our trip was followed by additional visits to Ukraine by the Atlantic Council Eurasia Center in February and March. With further research and follow-up discussions with experts, we have summarized our analysis in this recommendations-focused Atlantic Council report.",

Even as we carry out our relief activities, we continue to assess and respond to people\u2019s needs.\nOur Gender-based Violence (GBV) team in Kharkiv distributed 197 dignity kits there this week to women and girls evacuated from around Vovchansk and Lyptsi. At the same time, a psychologist from our Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MPHSS) team was on hand to assess needs and offer psychological first aid\u2014providing support to 43 people. On June 4, the GBV team also distributed 18 dignity kits at a collective center housing some of the IDPs.

Two weeks later, they came back to Ukraine thinking that the conflict would be over soon.\n\u201cAfter two weeks, we decided to return to Odesa, but then the bombing started again,\u201d shares Anna.\nShe crossed the border for the second time, with her parents, husband, and four children. She was already pregnant, and little Diana was born in the neighboring country.\n\"My children were traumatized, and it took more than a year to recover and make them feel safe again,\" explains Anna.\nShe adds, \u201cThe first day we arrived in Moldova they were visibly distressed. My second child, Sonia, for example, would always draw spiders that murder people. She claimed that she was scared of spiders.\u201d\nAnna and her children take part in psychological support sessions designed for both adults and their children. They come on a weekly basis to the center run by Communitas, World Vision's local partner, where they benefit from art therapy, non-formal education, individual and group counselling. The facility is located in Chisinau, Moldova and is currently funded by the Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC).\n\u201cThe DEC-funded project offers group and individual psychosocial support sessions for both adults and children, helping them deal with the trauma of war and displacement. Sharing their burdens with fellow refugees and dedicated volunteers provides a sense of community and understanding\u201d explains Lilia Damaschin, World Vision's Mental Health and Psychosocial (MHPSS) Adviser.\nIt\u2019s been half a year since they didn't show signs of acute distress, and I feel relieved knowing that my children are feeling better now.\n\u201cAdults found solace in the program, which not only helped refugees cope with the past but also fostered hope for the future. This newfound sense of purpose and optimism is a testament to the program's success. Tears flowed freely, prayers were shared, and laughter gradually returned,\u201d shared Damaschin.\nNadejda Zastavnetchi, a volunteer who is part of World Vision's cash for work program funded by DEC, and who has worked at the center from the beginning, has witnessed improvements from both parents and children.\n\"We saw a revolutionary shift in both children's and parents' behavior after participating in art therapy and counselling sessions,\" said Zastavnetchi.\n\"They regained hope, became more open to sharing, and wanted to rebuild their lives,\" she added.\n\u201cThey love being here and are close to us. These individuals are opening up, and sometimes even crying. We sometimes pray together. Every session ends with a smile and a thank you. They're simply happy here,\u201d concluded Nadejda.\nAnna can attest to these improvements for herself and her children.\n\u201cNow Sonia doesn't draw spiders anymore. My children somehow accepted the situation and felt at home once,\" said Anna.\n\"It\u2019s been half a year since they didn't show signs of acute distress, and I feel relieved knowing that my children are feeling better now,\" she added.\nWhile Ukrainian children benefit from art therapy and psychosocial support sessions, their parents attend group counseling.\nUkrainian children like Sonia use safe spaces to express their emotions, not just through daily interactions with other children, but also through art therapy, games, and discussions.\n\u201cDuring my time spent in the center, I realized that I would like to be a doctor in the future, maybe a veterinarian. That way, I will no longer be afraid of spiders,\u201d shared Sonia.\nSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine, more than 117,000 people, including refugees, internally displaced and host communities, have benefited from mental health and psychosocial support services in Ukraine, Moldova, Romania and Georgia.\nStory and photos by Dan Munteanu, (Former) Communications Officer",

        "content": "title: Kakhovka Dam destruction, one year on [EN/UK] \n content: One year ago today, the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam unleashed a devastating flooding that left over 620 square kilometres of the Ukrainian territory under water. This was possibly one of the most significant incidents of damage to civilian infrastructure since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The destruction claimed lives, forced thousands to flee, left thousands more stranded and laid waste to Ukrainian land and livelihoods on both sides of the front line The Kakhovka reservoir, the primary source of drinking water for over 700,000 people in southern Ukraine, was depleted. The catastrophic environmental effects of the flooding will linger for years to come, affecting not only Ukraine.\nThe UN response\nThe UN response was swift and continues today. Regrettably, denials from the Russian Federation prevented the UN from reaching people in Russian-occupied areas.\nIn areas under Ukrainian control, the response began on day one. The UN and its partners rushed to provide people with desperately-needed water, food, health care, cash and protection and transport services, reaching close to 200,000 people in just a few days. Despite tremendous challenges, in June 2023 alone, the UN delivered approximately 20 inter-agency convoys bringing almost 80 truckloads of vital items to thousands of people affected by the disaster, in addition to the regular assistance provided separately by UN agencies and NGOs. Some supplies were delivered by boats and amphibious trucks, ensuring aid would reach people stranded by the flooding.\nWater, food, health and cash assistance to people impacted by the disaster\nThe UN and humanitarian organizations delivered around 20 million litres of bottled and trucked potable water, supported nearly 70 local water enterprises to ensure supply, supporting the drilling of boreholes for water production, including by delivering pumps, tap stands, water treatment units and water storage provided. Cash assistance was provided to nearly 40,000 people, while over 200,000 rations of ready-to-eat food were distributed in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. Health assistance was also a priority, with mobile teams providing aid across the affected areas. The UN also supplied medical equipment, including emergency health kits, trauma kits, diagnostic tests, and treatments for acute watery diarrhoea, including cholera, sufficient to provide healthcare to nearly 38,000 people for three to six months.\nNearly 65,000 emergency repair items and household supplies were distributed to people whose homes had been damaged in the Kherson region. From the earliest days of the disaster, Child Protection organizations reached over 14,000 people, including 7,300 children and over 6,600 caregivers, by deploying multidisciplinary mobile teams to the affected areas, providing mental health and psychosocial support, delivering essential supplies, and ensuring child protection case management and legal assistance.\nThe response continues to ensure people can recover from this human-made catastrophe\nThe UN response extends beyond the emergency phase and continues to support communities in southern Ukraine as they recover from yet another disaster caused by Russia\u2019s invasion. This included supporting a Post Disaster Needs Assessment and an assessment on the environmental impact of the destruction to inform the ongoing response.\nIn the following months, the UN and its partners repaired homes for hundreds of people and deployed nearly 200 health workers to southern Ukraine to ensure services would continue despite the destruction. Repairing and building alternative water sources became a priority, with mobile water treatment facilities deployed to the Kherson and Dnipro regions, water pumps sent to Nikopol, and efforts to increase the water supply from the Karachunivsky water complex, supporting 600,000 people in Krivy Rih City.\nWritten by\nSaviano Abreu\nUN Ukraine Spokesperson / Strategic Communications Advisor\ndeabreuisidoro@un.org+380 50 422 3943",

As of 23 May 2024, The Head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration and the Head of the Regional Military Administration, Vadym Filashkin, announced that due to the worsening security situation in the region, the operation of educational consultation points for schoolchildren is temporarily suspended. Any gathering of people, especially children, could pose a threat to their lives. As of 29 May 2024, the regional commission on technogenic and environmental safety and emergencies in Donetska oblast has decided to evacuate families with children from Lyman, the villages of Lypove, Nove, Karpivka, Stavky of the Lymanska hromada, the village of Prohres of the Hrodivska hromada, and the settlement of Zoria of the Illinivska hromada. The decision must be coordinated with the Coordination Headquarters for the mandatory evacuation of the population under martial law conditions. The heads of the military administrations have been tasked with pre-determining evacuation routes and the availability of transit hubs. It was also noted that there is a need for the health and recreation of children who have been traumatized by the war and need psychological assistance and rest.\n\nActivities: Provision of MHPSS (including social-emotional learning and informal education support) Distribution of learning kits and electronic devices for learning; Establishment of safe spaces for children to play, and receive wellbeing and learning support ( (Temporary Learning Spaces/Digital Learning Centers) ; Catch up learning support services for children to regain access to formal learning; Wellbeing support services for teachers.\n---\nModality of assistance\n\ntargeted educational support for children in collective cites (in coordination with CCCM cluster); educational support for IDP children in receiving hromadas of Donetska and Dnipropetrovska oblasts (esp. Dobropillia, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk) both offline and online; online educational and wellbeing support to affected children where security situation prevents offline learning services.\n\nConsidering the security situation in Donetska oblast, we recommend the partners working or planning to work in Donetska oblast switch to an online format or use mobile brigades in those areas where offline mode activities can put beneficiaries at risk. In other areas, the security situation should be taken into consideration and regular consultations with the authorities should be conducted.

        "content": "title: Ukraine: Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict - May 2024 [EN/UK] \n content: In Ukraine UN Human Rights Monitors Report the Highest Monthly Number of Civilian Casualties in Almost a Year\n07 June 2024\nKyiv, 7 June 2024 \u2013 May saw a significant monthly increase in casualties with 31 per cent more civilians killed than in April marking the highest number of civilian casualties in nearly a year, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today.\n\u201cOver half of the casualties in May occurred in Kharkiv city and region where Russian armed forces launched a new ground offensive on 10 May,\u201d said Danielle Bell, the head of HRMMU. \u201cThe main reason for the high number of civilian casualties is the use of air-dropped bombs and missiles in populated areas such as communities near the frontline and Kharkiv city,\u201d she added.\nBell noted that attacks in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, have been particularly deadly but that no place in Ukraine was safe. In its monthly update on civilian harm, HRMMU said conflict-related violence killed at least 174 civilians and injured 690 in Ukraine in May, the highest number of civilian casualties since June 2023.\nOn 23 May, missiles struck a printing house in Kharkiv city, killing seven employees and injuring at least 21 civilians, mainly women. Two days later two air-dropped bombs struck Epitsentr, a large home improvement center, in Kharkiv city, killing 19 civilians and injuring 54, including many employees. On 31 May, multiple missiles hit a residential area in Kharkiv city, including a multi-story building, killing nine civilians and injuring at least 15.\n\u201cThe attacks on a shopping center and printing house in Kharkiv city highlight the stark vulnerability of civilians engaged in everyday activities, where even routine tasks like buying supplies to repair damaged homes can result in the loss of life and loved ones,\u201d said Bell.\nHRMMU visited the sites of the attacks, documented the damage to civilian property and infrastructure, and verified the number and status of civilian casualties in these and other attacks.\nOne 45-year-old woman told HRMMU that she tried to seek shelter after a large explosion in her neighborhood shattered the windows in her ground-floor apartment around midnight on 30-31 May. Before she managed to leave the apartment, however, a second explosion caused a wall in her apartment to collapse, trapping her leg underneath rubble. A fire broke out in the building, but emergency workers managed to rescue her. As first responders took her to the hospital, she heard two more explosions in the neighborhood. She said that she felt lucky to be alive. The attack, however, killed several of her neighbors who lived on floors above her.\nThe intensification of hostilities in Kharkiv region has dramatically affected frontline communities, including by causing the near complete destruction of the town of Vovchansk. HRMMU conducted 92 interviews with evacuees who described massive attacks with artillery, aerial bombs and missiles that caused them to shelter for days in basements without basic necessities before risking their lives to evacuate. A couple who evacuated with their elderly parents said that Vovchansk was in ruins, with street-by-street destruction as the city came under fire.\nHRMMU said in May the vast majority of civilian casualties (92 per cent), and damage to educational and health facilities (96 per cent) continued to occur in Government-controlled territory.\nThe rise in deaths and injuries was accompanied by intensifying attacks on energy infrastructure, forcing Ukraine to introduce rolling blackouts across the country, compounding the difficulties faced by millions of Ukrainians who have now lived through almost 28 months of war.\nHRMMU documented 24 attacks on energy infrastructure (19 attacks in Government-controlled territory and 5 in territory occupied by the Russian Federation), destroying or damaging power generation plants and electricity substations and temporarily disrupting access to electricity and water supply. HRMMU also documented six attacks on railway infrastructure in Government-controlled territory in May.\nKrzysztof Janowski\nOHCHR\nSpokesperson\nkrzysztof.janowski@un.org+380952300437",

        "content": "title: Ukraine Protection Cluster: Legal Aid Bulletin for May 2024 [EN/UK] \n content: The Legal Aid Working Group of the Protection Cluster, based on the analysis of information provided by its members and collected from open sources, identified the following current legal issues in May 2024.\nHousing, land and property issues\n1. The number of requests for monetary compensation from owners of destroyed housing located in the temporarily occupied territory has increased, as they expect that the eRecovery program on destroyed housing will be expanded to the temporarily occupied territories. On 25.04.2024, during the round table on \"Access to compensation for destroyed housing: problematic issues of confirmation of ownership rights and ways to resolve them\", it was stated that the experimental project (under the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers 1185 of 27 October 2023) of the Ministry of Infrastructure and UNDP to examine destroyed housing located in the city of Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia Oblast (temporarily occupied territory) through remote sensing using Earth technology was successful. The Head of the Parliamentary Committee on the \u2018Organization of State Power, Local Self-Government, Regional Development and Urban Planning\u2019, Olena Shuliak, and the Deputy Prime Minister \u2013 Minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk, noted plans to expand this program to other temporarily occupied territories in the future, including Mariupol and Bakhmut. Such plans are likely subject to funding support. The relevant draft law is registered in the Parliament (Verkhovna Rada), which is preparing for the second reading. The program would provide for the possibility of receiving compensation for housing located in temporarily occupied territories only in cases of destruction as determination of the degree of damage to housing based on satellite images is not possible.\n2. Owners of housing located in the temporarily occupied territory who acquired ownership before 2013 face problems when registering the right of ownership in the State Register of Property Rights (SRPR), even when hard copies of title documents are available. Registration of the property rights to the SRPR is a pre-condition to apply for compensation. The law obliges state registrars to receive the information necessary for state registration of rights from the relevant Bureau of Technical Inventory (BTI). Most BTIs in the temporarily occupied territories were not relocated to the territory under the control of the Government of Ukraine. Moreover, some of these BTIs were damaged, destroyed or looted. As a result, obtaining information from them is very difficult and generally considered impossible. Under such circumstances, the owners of such housing have to undergo a judicial procedure to recognize the right of ownership, paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof.\n3. It is common for notaries to refuse to open an inheritance case about property located in the temporarily occupied territory, likely due to the potential legal responsibility for such actions which would lie with the respective notary. The problem most often arises with private notaries, which have more discretion than state notaries, in particular in Vinnytsia Oblasts and in Kryvyi Rih City. As a result, the applicants (heirs) are forced to apply to the court to confirm ownership in the order of inheritance, paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof.\n4. The number of requests for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for plots of land for horticulture has increased rapidly. The Law on land plots allocation sets a deadline of 1 January 2025 for registering the ownership of a land plot, otherwise it will be considered that such owner or heir has refused to appropriate the land plot. In the absence of such ownership registration, the land will be considered as free and can be sold by the state to a new owner. At the same time, the legislator initiated amendments to this Law, extending the deadline for registration of land ownership until 1 January 2028. Amendments were passed in the parliament and await the Presidential signature. If the specified draft law enters into force, the number of such applications will probably decrease.",

To preserve the lives of the population located in a 5-10 kilometer zone from the border f it is recommended that people be evacuated to safe, prepared places in accordance with the evacuation plans of the hromadas of Sumy, Okhtyrka, Konotop, and Shostka rayons or other oblasts. Voluntary early evacuation of the population from Bilopillia and Vorozhba is also underway. The local authorities are concerned about the growing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the event of a security situation deteriorating within a 20-30 km zone. With only 11 Collective Centers (CCs) in Sumy, there is insufficient accommodation for potential IDPs. Educational institutions offering online learning and having facilities suitable for housing IDPs are currently being evaluated. While long-term evacuees may stay in collective sites, the general trend in the oblast is that beneficiaries do not stay for long in CCs but aim to return home as long as it is safe. Hence, provision of support to children who transit from collective sites might only be a one-of- time activity.\n\nModality of assistance: - targeted offline wellbeing and educational support for children in collective cites (in coordination with CCCM cluster); offline educational support for IDP children in hosting hromadas; - online educational support and mobile brigades support to affected children where security situation prevents offline learning services (integrated with CP services).\n\nActivities prioritized:\n\nProvision of MHPSS (including social-emotional learning and informal education support) Distribution of learning kits and electronic devices for learning; Establishment of safe spaces for children to play, and receive wellbeing and learning support (Temporary Learning Spaces/Digital Learning Centers) ; Catch up learning support services for children to regain access to formal learning;\n---\n\u25cf Wellbeing support services for teachers.

These stories aim to help children aged 2 to 6 to better interact with peers and adults, understand their emotions, explore the world around them and acquire other essential skills.\nThe book contains 16 fairy tales, featuring characters known as the Sparks \u2013 Mio, Pum, Bryn and Zhuzh \u2013 who are already beloved by hundreds of thousands of children. These characters encounter everyday situations familiar to all children and use their \u2018superpowers\u2019, or knowledge and skills. As children identify with the fairy tale characters' actions, they also gain new \u2018superpowers\u2019 from these engaging and clever stories.\n\"Even though the war disrupts education in kindergartens, the development of preschoolers must continue,\u201d said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative to Ukraine. \u201cUNICEF is constantly creating alternative tools for parents, caregivers and educators to use in kindergartens, at home and elsewhere. We want every child, regardless of their circumstances, to have age-appropriate development opportunities.\u201d\nIn the 16 engaging stories, children learn essential skills appropriate for their age, such as understanding sensory perception, emotions, creativity, safe behaviour, independence, responsibility and interacting with adults. Each story is paired with captivating exercises and activities to reinforce these skills.\nThe book is available in three formats \u2013 print, electronic and audio \u2013 allowing children and adults to enjoy the stories in their preferred way.\nUNICEF will distribute free printed copies to parents of preschool children and kindergarten teachers in frontline areas of Ukraine during the summer reading period. The electronic and audio versions can be accessed, listened to and downloaded on the NUMO platform, UNICEF Ukraine YouTube channel, and resources like Yakaboo, MEGOGO, Listen and Abuk.\nUNICEF advocates for inclusive education and supports the Ukrainian Government in creating an accessible educational environment for all. The electronic version of \u2018Sparks of Superpowers\u2019 uses the Barrier Free font, adhering to accessibility standards, and the Cyrillic Inclusion UKR font, designed to aid children with dyslexia in mastering reading skills.\nThe audio version features narration by famous Ukrainian parents \u2013 Svitlana Tarabarova, Timur Miroshnychenko, Katya Blestka and Artem Logay. Ukrainian writers Maria Artemenko, Nastia Muzychenko and Halyna Tkachuk authored the fairy tales, with psychological and pedagogical guidance from Svitlana Royz and Solomiya Boykovych.\nInformation:\nThe \u2018Sparks of Superpowers\u2019 book is part of the NUMO preschool development initiative, implemented by UNICEF in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine. \u2018Sparks of Superpowers\u2019 offers a variety of free educational tools and methods for preschool children's development, including puppet theatre, colouring books, a series of cartoons and a book of fairy tales. These resources were created by a team of UNICEF experts in Ukraine, supported by the Ministry of Education and Science, specifically for the NUMO preschool development platform.\nThe primary objective of the programme is to support the daily development of preschool children in all circumstances, including during times of war. These innovative tools are designed to help parents, guardians, educators and public sector workers find creative and effective approaches to ensuring quality preschool education and development.\nTo help children develop 16 skills that are important for a child aged 3 to 6 years, UNICEF, together with the Ministry of Education and Science, has launched:\nThe NUMO education platform for the development of preschool children, presenting preschool skills in a simple, understandable way with practical tips and exercises;\nA free offline application with interactive games for preschool children, everyday tips for parents and materials that will contribute to the harmonious development of children;\nThe online kindergarten NUMO, featuring educational and developmental videos about the environment, various experiments and physical activities for children aged 3 to 6;\nA Viber or Telegram chatbot that works as a planner.\nIn 2022, over 5 million people used NUMO services for preschoolers' development.\nMedia contacts\nOleksandra Burynska\nCommunications Specialist\nUNICEF Ukraine\nEmail: oburynska@unicef.org",

The school was subjected to repeated Russian attacks in February, March, and April 2022. \u00a9 2022 Human Rights Watch\nThe Ukraine Recovery Conference in Berlin should prioritize donor support to rebuild and make accessible thousands of damaged schools and ensure children and teachers have access to equipment and technology for distance learning.\nUkraine still relies on the Soviet-era legacy of institutionalizing children deemed to have disabilities or to be from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.\nDonors need to encourage Ukraine to maintain progress in moving children who live in institutions into family-type settings and mainstream education, and to provide resources for this.\n(Berlin, June 7, 2024) \u2013 Foreign governments should use the June 11-12, 2024 Ukraine Recovery Conference to secure resources to protect and fulfill children\u2019s rights, Human Rights Watch and the Ukraine Child Rights Network said today. These should include safe access to quality education and the right to live in families rather than in harmful institutional settings. The conference aims to generate government aid and private-sector investment for \u201crecovery, reconstruction, reform, and modernization\u201d in Ukraine.\nIn the midst of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Ukrainian authorities have pledged to carry out education reforms intended to keep children learning safely, and also initiated a new strategy to end the harmful, Soviet-era legacy of institutionalizing children deemed to have disabilities or to be from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Human Rights Watch research found the needs are vast and that continued international support may be critical for success.\n\u201cA better future for Ukraine means taking the steps needed for every child to realize their potential, and there should be no backsliding in Berlin,\u201d said Bill Van Esveld, associate children\u2019s rights director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cGetting an education and living in a family rather than an institution are not nice-to-haves, but are a child\u2019s fundamental rights, and they deserve full donor support.\u201d\nHuman Rights Watch has documented vast damage and destruction to Ukrainian schools and preschools from attacks, as well as from Russian forces that occupied, pillaged, and trashed schools during the first months of the fighting. In some cases, Russian forces fired on the schools they had used as they withdrew from areas they had occupied, further damaging them.\nAs of May, more than 3,790 educational facilities had been damaged or destroyed, according to Ukrainian government figures.\nThe damage to schools and risks to students led Ukraine to shift back to distance learning, just as students were returning to in-person learning after the Covid-19 pandemic. However, many parents and children lack the devices and connectivity needed for distance learning, Human Rights Watch found, which moreover may not be accessible for children with disabilities. Ukrainian authorities also require schools to have adequate bomb shelters to resume in-person education.\nAt the Berlin conference, Ukraine\u2019s international partners and donors should help the authorities ensure access to quality education for all children, including by restoring damaged educational facilities across Ukraine, in line with safety requirements and strict adherence to accessibility standards mandatory under Ukrainian law. Donor funding should support the development of inclusive rather than segregated education, the groups said.\nThe full-scale invasion also exacerbated the risks to 105,000 children in institutions in Ukraine, including family separation, neglect, and forcible transfer and deportation by Russian and occupation authorities. Before the invasion, a large majority of children in institutions had parents with full parental rights, but children with disabilities were more often institutionalized instead being able to live with their families or in the community and attend mainstream schools.\nBut even in peacetime, decades of studies have shown that institutionalization is harmful to children. Warehousing children in institutions is prohibited by international human rights law as well as within the European Union, which Ukraine seeks to join.\nSeparately from the Berlin conference, the European Union recently approved the Ukrainian government\u2019s reconstruction plan, which unlocks 50 billion euro in EU funding. It includes plans for education reform and the construction of 700 large foster-family-style homes for 5,600 children who had been living in institutions. Ukraine also created a detailed roadmap to deinstitutionalization. The EU and Ukraine should continue to prioritize deinstitutionalization and care reform as part of Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction and EU integration.\nUnder previous governments, several efforts at reforming systems for caring for children with disabilities had failed, as civil society groups were marginalized and reform plans were undermined to exclude children with disabilities. Donors should continue to work closely with Ukrainian civil society groups that are leading the effort for meaningful reforms that ensure all children\u2019s access to protection and education, and their rights to live in a family and in a community, Human Rights Watch and the Ukraine Child Rights Network said.\n\u201cUkraine\u2019s recovery needs to prioritize children\u2019s rights, especially education, over rebuilding institutional care facilities and special schools\u2019 segregation practices,\u201d said Daria Kasyanova, Ukrainian Child Rights Network board chair. \u201cDeinstitutionalization reform is crucial, it means placing human and children's rights at the forefront.\u201d",

        "content": "title: One year after the Kakhovka dam disaster, MSF continues to provide support [EN/UK] \n content: Project Update\n6 June 2024\nThe M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) mobile clinic team is returning from the Kherson oblast (region) in southeastern Ukraine after an intense day of seeing patients. The road goes along the Inhulets river. Cows are grazing on the green slopes along the bank, and the fields are ripening, but the destroyed buildings in every village we pass and the \u2018Beware of mines\u2019 signs constantly remind us of the war.\nA year ago, one of the biggest disasters since the start of the full-scale war took place here in the southern part of Ukraine. At least 15 people died, 80 settlements were flooded, more than 37,000 houses were damaged, and the water supply system for a million people was destroyed when the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station dam was ruined in an explosion, according to the UN.\nSome of the territories flooded then are under Russian military occupation and the international community has been denied humanitarian access to them.\n\u201cWe were delivering medicines by boat\u201d\nThe Inhulets is a tributary of the Dnipro River that flows through three oblasts: Dnipro, Mykolaiv, and Kherson. After the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station on the night of 6 June 2023, 18 cubic kilometres of water poured into the Dnipro within three to four days, leading to a significant rise in the water level in the river and its tributaries, including the Inhulets.\nMSF medical activity manager Vladyslav Butskyi remembers that day well. Then, he worked as a doctor in one of our mobile clinics.\n\u201cIn the morning, as usual, we went to Snihurivka in the Mykolaiv region,\u201d says Butskyi. \u201cBut the water was rising, and by the end of the day, it was impossible to cross the Inhulets River on the bridges.\u201d\n\u201cCovering most communities in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions along the Inhulets presented a significant challenge,\u201d Butskiy explains. \u201cWe encountered two problems simultaneously. Firstly, there was a shortage of drinking water, as all wells and boreholes were flooded. Secondly, on the inaccessible side of the river, people relied on us as the sole organisation offering medical services and medicines at that time.\u201d\nThe following day, MSF purchased large quantities of water and containers for storage and began distributing them to residents. However, reaching the opposite bank of the Inhulets proved to be a much more challenging task.\nFor this, we sought the support of volunteers. We brought packs with water, water disinfectants, and medicine kits, and residents took all this to the other side by boat.\nVladyslav particularly remembers the story of a patient from a village with the same name as the river Inhulets.\n\u201cI got a call from a doctor from there and she said that this woman's [blood]sugar was extremely high and rapidly increasing,\u201d Butskiy. \u201cNeither the paramedic nor any of the neighbours had any medicines that could help. So, we sent everything we needed by boat from the village of Fedorivka, located across the river.\u201d\nAfter a while, thanks to residents, our team found a single bridge that had not been flooded, which allowed them to continue to see patients on the other side of the river.\nOne year after\nIn Novosofiyivka, Mykolaiv oblast, an MSF mobile clinic is conducting consultations at the local medical unit. There is a queue of residents in the corridor, mostly elderly women. While they are waiting, MSF health promoter Olena Lyubarska tells them how to avoid cardiovascular diseases and offers them some tea.\nOlha Panich is talking and laughing with her friends. Finally, it is her turn to see a doctor. MSF doctor Ruslan Shpara checks her blood pressure and blood sugar levels and prescribes the necessary medicines. Remembering the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, she starts to cry.\n\u201cThe lower street there, the riverbank, the lower houses, and gardens were all flooded,\u201d says Panich. \u201cPeople left that area and moved to higher ground.\u201d\n\u201cThe village was once under Russian military occupation and was partially flooded. Unfortunately, the patients here do not have access to quality medicine,\u201d says Dr Shpara. \u201cMost of them are middle-aged and elderly people with chronic diseases. I have observed a change in their mental state after the events: anxiety and sleep disturbances.\u201d\nOne nurse per village\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam has had a significant impact on the healthcare system in southern Ukraine, which is also affected by the fighting. Destroyed hospitals, a lack of medical staff, and daily shelling are the conditions under which healthcare workers in the Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts work.\nMinistry of Health nurse Olha Varenyk shows a medical facility in the village of Virivka in Kherson oblast. Now just over 200 people are left here. During the Russian military occupation of the village, the facility was destroyed and looted. Initially, the woman was conducting medical check-ups in her home, but recently a modular structure was installed in her yard, allowing her to see patients there. In addition, the MSF mobile clinic regularly visits the village and works with Olha in this structure.\nOlha Varenyk admits that working alone is not easy, but she does not want to leave.\n\u201cThis is my home. I grew up here,\u201d says Varenyk. \u201cI help people in their time of need. These are my people. I love them.\u201d\nMSF continues to work near the frontline. Our mobile clinics are staffed by doctors, paramedics, nurses, social workers, and psychologists who provide medical services and medicines to residents of towns and villages in Kherson, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, and Donetsk oblasts of Ukraine. MSF ambulances also operate here, transporting patients to hospitals. In addition, our teams support frontline hospitals with medical donations.",

        "content": "title: Ukraine: Security Council hears of escalating toll of Kharkiv attacks \n content: Briefing the Security Council in New York, UN Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Joyce Msuya urged the international community to work to end the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year.\nMs. Msuya said the civilian toll has continued to mount since her last briefing to the Council three weeks ago.\nKharkiv under fire\nWhile few areas have been spared from the hostilities, the Kharkiv region has suffered the heaviest impact after Russia stepped up attacks there on 10 May.\nUN human rights monitors in Ukraine reported on Friday that at least 174 people were killed and 690 injured nationwide in May, marking the highest number of civilian casualties in nearly a year.\nMore than half of them were in Kharkiv, located in the northeast of the country.\n\u201cShopping centres, homes, educational establishments, shops, office buildings, parks and public transport have all been struck in recent weeks,\u201d she said.\n\u00a9 OCHA/Tanya Lyubimova An aid worker registers an evacuated woman for multi-purpose cash assistance at the transit centre.\nSupporting displaced people\nAt least 18,000 people in the Kharkiv region have been newly displaced, she added, citing estimates from UN migration agency IOM.\nSome 50 humanitarian organizations have been providing food, water, clothes, cash, psychological support and other assistance to more than 12,000 people at a transit centre in Kharkiv city.\nMeanwhile, civilians who remain in frontline and border areas with Russia face dire conditions, as many are cut off from access to food, medical care, electricity and gas. Elderly people have been disproportionately affected as they often are unable or reluctant to leave their homes.\n\u201cIn northern Kharkiv \u2013 where the fighting is heaviest \u2013 more than half of those killed or injured have been over the age of 60,\u201d she said.\nThe UN human rights office, OHCHR, has verified that at least 11,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, and more than 21,000 injured, since the conflict began on 24 February 2022, although actual figures are likely much higher.\nInfrastructure attacks continue\nMs. Msuya noted that a year has passed since the Kakhova Dam disaster, \u201cone of the most significant incidents affecting civilian infrastructure since the start of the full-scale invasion.\u201d\nThe major dam was destroyed on 6 June 2023, resulting in monumental flooding that left large swathes of the surrounding area under water, destroying homes, displacing thousands of families, and disrupting water supplies for millions.\n\u201cIt showed just how extensive and long-lasting the humanitarian impacts of a single incident affecting critical infrastructure can be,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why it is deeply concerning that systematic attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure \u2013 a feature of this war since February 2022 - continue.\u201d\nSince 22 March, the UN and partners have identified six waves of attacks across 15 regions which have impacted healthcare and other social, financial and transport services, and disrupted electricity, gas and water supply for millions.\nEnergy affected, global food supply threatened\nMs. Msuya said Ukraine\u2019s energy system is now down over 60 per cent of its pre-war generation capacity, according to preliminary estimates from the UN Development Programme (UNDP).\n\u201cWe note that strikes inside the Russian Federation in recent months, including in the Belgorod region, have also resulted in civilian casualties and damage to residential homes and other civilian infrastructure,\u201d she said.\nShe also voiced deep concern over the impact of attacks on Ukraine\u2019s transportation and port infrastructure on global food security. Recent weeks have seen \u201cworrying indications of renewed upwards pressure on global grain prices, linked to this damage to infrastructure in Ukraine, among other factors.\u201d\nShe stressed the need for safe navigation throughout the Black Sea, and the protection of ports and related civilian infrastructure, so that food exports can reach global markets.\n\u00a9 UNICEF/Diego Ibarra S\u00e1nchez A Ukrainian teenager stands in the rubble of her destroyed school in Zhytomyr (file).\n\u2018Vast\u2019 humanitarian needs\nTurning to the humanitarian front, Ms. Msuya reported that needs remain \u201cvast\u201d as more than 14.6 million Ukrainians, roughly 40 per cent of the population, require some form of assistance. More than half are women and girls.\nA $3.1 billion funding appeal for 2024 has so far netted $856 million, allowing humanitarians to provide assistance to more than four million people during the first quarter of the year.\nShe pointed to the \u201cmany challenges\u201d humanitarians continues to face, chiefly lack of access to some 1.5 million civilians in Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\n\u201cAnd as the conflict continues to escalate, and we look to kickstart preparations for another winter dominated by war, full funding of the humanitarian response plan is urgently needed to sustain operations,\u201d she stressed.\nEnd the suffering\nMs. Msuya said that fighting continues to rip apart lives, homes and futures in Ukraine more than three years since the escalation of the war, and the UN and partners remain committed to support affected civilians.\nShe warned, however, that \u201cthe longer the violence and destruction continue, the greater the suffering will become, and the bigger the task to rebuild shattered lives and communities.\u201d\nConcluding her remarks, she welcomed the Ukraine Recovery Conference that will be held in Berlin next week, calling it a key opportunity to advance the Government\u2019s recovery priorities and leverage financing for critical development in affected areas.\n\u201cAnd we continue to urge the Security Council and all Member States to do everything within their power to ensure respect for the rules of war, pursue peace and bring the suffering of the Ukrainian people to an end.\u201d",

        "title": "Update 231 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine",
        "content": "title: Update 231 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine \n content: The challenging nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine was in the spotlight again this week at the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its Board of Governors discussing recent developments detailed in a new IAEA report and Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi meeting the country\u2019s energy minister.\nDirector General Grossi and Energy Minister German Galushchenko discussed the IAEA\u2019s ongoing efforts to support nuclear safety and security in Ukraine in their meeting today on the sidelines of the regularly scheduled June Board session at IAEA headquarters, where the Director General earlier in the week made clear his continued deep concerns about the situation.\nNuclear safety and security remains especially precarious at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), and is potentially also fragile elsewhere in Ukraine following attacks on its energy infrastructure in recent months, including on electricity sub-stations which are vital in providing off-site power to the operating nuclear power stations, as well as to the ZNPP, Director General Grossi said after his talks with Minister Galushchenko.\nNuclear power plants (NPPs) need reliable access to off-site power in order to cool their reactors and for other essential nuclear safety and security functions, as underlined in the Seven Pillars of Nuclear Safety and Security. However, Ukraine\u2019s electricity grid has been severely impacted by the conflict, with the ZNPP repeatedly losing connections to all its power lines.\n\u201cFor the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant in particular, the external power situation remains extremely vulnerable, prone to frequent outages. But it is also a wider concern in the current circumstances, where a loss of off-site power event has the potential to be even more serious given the higher nuclear fuel temperatures for reactors in operation in Ukraine. We are continuing to follow the situation very closely in this regard, as I also informed Minister Galushchenko in today\u2019s meeting,\u201d Director General Grossi said.\nDirector General Grossi, who had met with Rosatom head Alexey Likhachev in the Russian city of Kaliningrad last week, reiterated to Ukraine\u2019s energy minister that there was an understanding that the ZNPP would not be re-started as long as nuclear safety and security remained in jeopardy due to the conflict.\n\u201cIn these circumstances, operating this major nuclear plant would not be advisable,\u201d he said.\nAhead of this week\u2019s Board meeting, the Director General issued the 11th report on nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine since the conflict began in February 2022, covering developments in the three months to 24 May this year.\nAt the ZNPP this week, the IAEA team of experts stationed at the site has continued to conduct regular walkdowns to monitor nuclear safety and security at the plant.\nAt the same time, the team has continued to hear explosions some distance away from the site, a regular reminder of the ZNPP\u2019s frontline location.\nA year after the destruction of the downstream Kakhovka dam disrupted the ZNPP\u2019s supplies of cooling water, the team visited the site\u2019s cooling pond and observed that its height was almost 1.5 metres below the level before the dam was destroyed.\nThe plant, whose six reactors are all in cold shutdown, receives the cooling water it needs, for the reactors in the current shutdown state, from 11 groundwater wells that were built to supply about 250 m3 of water per hour to the site\u2019s sprinkler ponds.\nThe IAEA team continues to closely monitor the maintenance activities at the plant, another area highlighted by the Director General as posing a potential risk to nuclear safety and security in his Board statement on Monday.\nAs part of these activities, the IAEA experts visited the 750 kilovolt (kV) open switchyard and discussed ongoing maintenance on the relay protections for the transformer of reactor unit 2, among other activities.\nThey saw that some of the switchyard components, for one of the 750 kV lines, that were damaged in 2022 had been dismantled. However, the ZNPP is not currently planning to complete repairs, at this time, as the line itself remains unavailable due to damage sustained earlier in the conflict, away from the site. The ZNPP had four 750 kV lines available before the conflict, but only one is remaining.\nThe IAEA experts were informed that western-supplied switchyard equipment, installed before the conflict, remained in good condition. The ZNPP also stated that some spare parts remain available on site from western supplies and, if required, it can order similar equipment through suppliers from the Russian Federation.\nThe IAEA team of experts also visited the two fresh fuel storage facilities and the turbine building of unit 6, once again without being granted access to the western side of the building.\nIn addition, the ZNPP informed the IAEA experts on the status of its on- and off-site radiation monitoring stations. The team was informed that all four on-site radiation monitoring stations are operational, but that three of the 14 off-site stations remain damaged as a result of military activities in 2022.\nThe ZNPP said that manual radiation monitoring measurements are also carried out, and that there are plans to purchase new radiation monitoring stations consistent with the regulations of the Russian Federation, and a mobile radiation measurement laboratory for use in case of a nuclear or radiological emergency.\nThe IAEA experts present at Ukraine\u2019s other NPPs \u2013 Khelmnytskyy, Rivne and South Ukraine \u2013 and the Chornobyl site continue to perform routine walkdowns and assess nuclear safety and security. The teams reported that nuclear safety and security is being maintained despite the effects of the ongoing conflict, including air raid alarms on several days over the past week.\nOne reactor unit at each of the Rivne and the South Ukraine NPPs were in shutdown over the last week for planned maintenance and refuelling, while one other unit at the South Ukraine NPP is in planned outage.",

        "content": "title: One year after Ukraine\u2019s Kakhovka dam disaster \n content: The destruction of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine last June devastated communities, cutting off the water supply to one million people and making health care harder to access.\nAfter the dam at Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant in Ukraine's Kherson region was destroyed on June 6, 2023, Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) teams provided medical and humanitarian aid to people affected. One year after the tragedy, communities are still trying to cope with the consequences, including mental health effects such as anxiety and sleep disturbances.\nOn the banks of the Inhulets River in the Kherson region of Ukraine, cows graze on greenery beside ripened fields. The idyllic scene is interrupted, however, by the sight of destroyed buildings and \u201cBeware of mines\u201d signs\u2014reminders of the ongoing war.\nA year ago, this part of southern Ukraine suffered one of its biggest disasters since the start of the full-scale war when the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station dam was destroyed, killing 15 people. According to the United Nations, the breach damaged over 37,000 homes, 37 educational institutions, an estimated 11 health facilities, and disrupted the provision of drinking water and sanitation services to one million people, impacting their access to housing, education, health, and water.\nSome of the territories that flooded are now under Russian military occupation, and the international community has been denied humanitarian access.\nDelivering medicines by boat\nThe Inhulets is a tributary of the Dnipro River that flows through three regions: Dnipro, Mykolaiv, and Kherson. After the destruction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station on the night of June 6, 2023, 18 cubic kilometers of water poured into the Dnipro River within three to four days, significantly raising the water level of the river and its tributaries, including the Inhulets.\nMSF medical activity manager Vladyslav Butskyi remembers that day well. At the time, he was working as a doctor in one of our mobile clinics. \"In the morning, as usual, we went to Snihurivka in the Mykolaiv region,\u201d he recounts. \u201cBut the water was rising, and by the end of the day, it was impossible to cross the Inhulets River on the bridges.\"\n\"Covering most communities in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions along the Inhulets presented a significant challenge,\" Butskiy explains. \"We encountered two problems simultaneously. First, there was a shortage of drinking water, as all wells and boreholes were flooded. Second, on the inaccessible side of the river, we were the sole organization offering medical services and medicines at that time.\"\nThe following day, Doctors Without Borders purchased large quantities of water and storage containers and began distributing them to residents. However, reaching the opposite bank of the Inhulets proved to be a much more challenging task.\nFor this, our teams sought the support of volunteers. We brought packs with water, water disinfectants, and medicine kits, which residents transported to the other side by boat.\nVladyslav particularly remembers the story of a patient from a village with the same name as the river. \"I got a call from a doctor there and she said that a woman's [blood]sugar was extremely high and rapidly increasing. Neither the paramedic nor any of the neighbors had any medicines that could help. So we sent everything we needed by boat from the village of Fedorivka, located across the river.\"\nAfter a while, the Doctors Without Borders team found a single bridge that had not been flooded, thanks to the help of residents. This allowed our team to continue seeing patients on the other side of the river.\nBitter memories, one year later\nIn Novosofiyivka, Mykolaiv region, the Doctors Without Borders mobile clinic team conducts consultations at the local medical unit. Residents are lined up in the corridor; most are elderly women. While they wait, MSF health promoter Olena Lyubarska explains how to avoid cardiovascular diseases as she offers them tea.\nAmong those waiting is Olha Panich, talking and laughing with her friends until it\u2019s finally her turn to see a doctor. After MSF doctor Ruslan Shpara checks her blood pressure and blood sugar levels and prescribes the necessary medicines, Panich begins to cry.\n\"The street, the river bank, the houses, and gardens were all flooded,\u201d she says, remembering the destruction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station. \u201cPeople left that area and moved to higher ground.\"\nDr. Shpara explains, \"The village was once under Russian military occupation and was partially flooded. Unfortunately, the patients here do not have access to quality medicine. Most of them are middle-aged and elderly people with chronic diseases. I have observed a change in their mental state after the events: anxiety and sleep disturbances.\"\nA village with one nurse\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka dam has had a significant impact on the health care system in southern Ukraine, which is also affected by the fighting. Health care workers in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions work amid poor conditions including destroyed hospitals, a lack of medical staff, and daily shelling.\nOnly 200 people are left in the village of Virivka in Kherson. During the Russian military occupation of the village, its medical facility was destroyed and looted. Ministry of Health nurse Olha Varenyk initially had to conduct medical check-ups in her home, but recently a modular structure was installed in her yard, allowing her to see patients there. The Doctors Without Borders mobile clinic team regularly visits the village and works with Olha in this structure.\nVarenyk admits that working alone is not easy, but she does not want to leave: \"This is my home. I grew up here. I help people in their time of need. These are my people. I love them.\"\nAbout our work in Ukraine\nDoctors Without Borders continues to work near the front lines of Ukraine. Our mobile clinics are staffed by doctors, paramedics, nurses, social workers, and psychologists who provide medical services and medicines to residents of towns and villages in the Kherson, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, and Donetsk regions. Our teams transport patients to hospitals in our ambulances and support frontline hospitals with medical donations.",

        "content": "title: protection of civilians in armed conflict May 2024 update Ukraine: \n content: protection of civilians in armed conflict May 2024 update Ukraine:\n\nSummary\n\nResidential houses in Kharkiv destroyed in an overnight attack at the end of May. Date: 7 June 2024\n\n\u2022 At least 174 civilians were killed and 690 injured in Ukraine in May, the highest monthly number of civilian casualties the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has documented since June 2023. The number of killed civilians represents a 31 per cent increase compared to April 2024.\n\n\u2022 The increase in civilian casualties was mainly due to attacks in Kharkiv region since 10 May related to a ground offensive launched by Russian armed forces from the Russian Federation into the Kharkiv region. Attacks in Kharkiv region caused 53 per cent of overall civilian casualties in May.\n\n\u2022 Sixty-five per cent of overall damage to educational and health facilities also took place in Kharkiv region, with particularly widespread destruction taking place in Vovchansk, a city in Kharkiv region close to the border between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.\n\n\u2022 The vast majority of civilian casualties (92 per cent), and damage to educational and health facilities (96 per cent) continued to occur in Government-controlled territory.\n\n\u2022 HRMMU documented 24 attacks on energy infrastructure (19 attacks in Government-controlled territory and 5 in territory occupied by the Russian Federation), destroying or damaging power generation plants and electricity substations and temporarily disrupting access to electricity and water supply. HRMMU also documented six attacks on railway infrastructure in Government-controlled territory in May.\n---\nCivilian casualties May 2024\n\nAttacks damaging educational and health facilities May 2024 Representative incidents\n\nAn energy facility damaged by an attack.\n\n\u2022 On 8 May, a large-scale missile and loitering munition attack throughout the country damaged or destroyed at least 8 energy infrastructure facilities in 6 regions across Ukraine. \u2022 On 19 May, two consecutive strikes on a lakeside recreation center in Cherkaska Lozova (Kharkiv region) killed 6 civilians (5 men and 1 woman) and injured at least 13 (6 men, 6 women and 1 girl). \u2022 On 23 May, missiles struck a printing house in Kharkiv city, killing 7 employees (5 women and 2 men) and injuring at least 21 civilians (19 women and 2 men). \u2022 On 25 May, an attack struck a large construction hypermarket in Kharkiv city, killing 19 civilians (11 men, 6 women, 1 boy and 1 girl), and injuring 54 (37 men and 17 women), including many employees. Later that day, a missile struck Kharkiv city center, injuring 25 civilians (15 men, 9 women and 1 boy). \u2022 Around midnight on 30-31 May, multiple missiles hit a residential area in Kharkiv city, including a multi-story building, killing 9 civilians (5 women and 4 men), and injuring at least 15 (7 men, 6 women, 1 boy and 1 girl).\n\n\u201cStreets are on fire. Street by street is being erased from the face of the earth. Everything is in ruins around you.\u201d\n\n- A female evacuee from Vovchansk interviewed by HRMMU in the collective IDP center in Kharkiv.\n---\nCivilian casualties since 24 February 2022\n\nAttacks damaging educational and health facilities since 24 February 2022\n\nCivilians killed since 2014\n---\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine\n\nHRMMU collects information about civilian harm from conflict- related violence from a wide range of sources, including through interviews with victims, their relatives, and witnesses; open-source information, including photo and video material; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non- governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration takes time. This means that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual records of civilian harm where the \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would\n\nThe actual number might be higher as some reports are still pending confirmation.\n\nhave reasonable grounds to believe that the harm took place as described. HRMMU refers to information that meets this criteria as \u201cverified.\u201d When HRMMU has not yet verified a casualty or reported an individual case of death or injury, it does not necessarily mean that HRMMU has established the individual as an active member of an armed group or as someone who directly participated in hostilities. In many cases, the non-designation of an individual as a civilian reflects a lack of information, rather than confirming the individual\u2019s status as a combatant. The actual extent of civilian harm \u2013 both casualties and infrastructure damage \u2013 is likely considerably higher as many reports of civilian harm, particularly from the period immediately after the full-scale armed attack, have not been possible to verify due to the large number of reports and the lack of access to relevant areas. The number of civilian casualties is likely particularly undercounted in cities such as Mariupol (Donetsk region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there was protracted intensive fighting at the start of the armed attack in 2022.\n\nIncidents in which civilians were killed or injured by shelling from artillery, tanks and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), by cruise and ballistic missiles (air, sea and land-\n\nbased), and by air strikes, including loitering munitions and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\nHRMMU believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as many reports, particularly from certain locations and from the immediate period after 24 February 2022, are\n\nstill pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there were allegations of high civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. An increase in total figures in this update compared with the previous update is not only due to casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure that occurred in the reporting period as HRMMU also continues to corroborate cases that occurred before the reporting period.\n\nIncidents in which civilians were killed or injured by fire from small arms and light weapons, including as a result of crossfire, sniper fire, escalation of force incidents (cases in\n\nwhich military opened fire on civilians whom they perceived as a threat), and wilful killings, as well as road accidents involving either military vehicles or civilian vehicles driven by military in the area of hostilities.\n\nFor Ukrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page.\n\nFor more information and media requests, please contact: - Kris Janowski (+380952300437) / krzysztof.janowski@un.org - Kateryna Girniak (+380504868364) / kateryna.girniak@un.org\n\nTwitter: @UNHumanRights Facebook: @unitednationshumanrights Instagram: @unitednationshumanrights",

        "content": "title: First Person: Guest editing UN News\u2019s first live blog takeover \n content: That\u2019s happening on the opening day of the 17th session of the Conference of States Parties (COSP17) to the game-changing Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, taking place from 11 to 13 June 2024.\nFrom being a delegate at COSP16 to taking over UN News\u2019s live blog at COSP17, the activist with Down syndrome said his mission is to amplify voices and drive change, including on this year\u2019s themes of jobs, tech and humanitarian responses in times of crisis.\nHere\u2019s more from our guest editor ahead of COSP17:\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m most looking forward to is connecting with others and meeting other people who care about the same things I do. Last year, I made new friends and shared stories, which was really cool.\nI also looking forward to accessibility and inclusion. One thing that really stood out to me last year was how everyone talked about making things easier for people with disabilities. It was great to see so many people care about making the world a better place for us.\nI\u2019m from Canada and am passionate about disability rights. I\u2019m a part of the L\u2019Arche community in Toronto. L\u2019Arche has nearly 160 communities in 37 countries around the world, fostering inclusive relationships where people with and without intellectual disabilities make each other\u2019s lives better.\n\u00a9 L\u2019Arche/Warren Pot Nick Herd in the UN General Assembly Hall for COSP16.\nJobs, tech and humanitarian crises\nThis year, the focus at COSP17 is on tech, jobs and humanitarian crises through a lens of people with disabilities. Technology is changing the way we live and work, and it\u2019s no different for people with disabilities.\nWe\u2019re going to be discussing how advancements in technology can create new opportunities and support for individuals like us. From accessibility features in smartphones to assistive devices in the workplace, tech has the power to level the playing field and enhance our lives.\nUnfortunately, conflicts and wars around the world disproportionately affect people with disabilities, and I\u2019ve seen first-hand the challenges faced by individuals in L\u2019Arche communities in conflict zones. COSP17 is going to be shedding light on these issues and advocating for better support and protection for those affected by conflict.\nWhen it comes to jobs, finding and maintaining employment can be tough for anyone, but it can be especially challenging for people with disabilities. Discrimination, lack of accessibility and stigma are just some of the barriers we face. Through discussions, we\u2019ll be working towards solutions to improve employment opportunities and ensure equal rights for all.\nThese issues are important to me and so is the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nHow tech helps me as a person with a disability\nTechnology plays a crucial role in enhancing my life as a person with a disability, enabling me to connect, communicate and comprehend information more easily and independently. Here\u2019s how:\nStaying connected: Technology lets me stay connected with friends, family and the world around me. Whether it's through social media, video calls or messaging apps, I can stay in touch no matter where I am. You can even follow me on Instagram!\nBetter communication: Tech tools like speech-to-text, text-to-speech and communication apps help me communicate more easily. They make it simpler for me to express myself and understand others, whether I\u2019m chatting with friends or participating in meetings. For example, I\u2019ll be using WhatsApp to stay connected with our L\u2019Arche team while here at COSP17 in New York City.\nUnderstanding information: Technology helps me understand information. With tools like screen readers, magnifiers and accessible websites, I can access and understand information more effectively, empowering me to learn, work and engage in various activities.\n\u00a9 Peter Ringenberg Nick Herd working as a creative consultant on the set of a short movie production for L\u2019Arche Canada and the United States in March 2022.\n3 ways employment changed my life\nAs a person with a disability, jobs matter. What\u2019s most important is being included.\nMy animated film Freebird was long-listed for an Academy Award in 2021. It was a big deal. It showed that people with disabilities can shine in the spotlight too. Working on the film as a creative director was a highlight of my career.\nWorking together is also crucial. Collaboration is key in my acting gigs. Working with others helps us all come up with better ideas and make great things happen.\nEqually important is being able to express myself. As an artist and freelancer, having a job means I can bring my unique perspective to the table. It lets me be myself and show what I can do, which is pretty awesome.\nDignity and disability\nEvery single person deserves to feel safe and respected in their life. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, where you come from, whether you have a disability or not \u2013 being treated badly is never okay. Whether it\u2019s at school, work or anywhere else, bullying, mistreatment and neglect should never be tolerated.\nIn tough times like emergencies, disasters or wars, it\u2019s super important for governments to do everything they can to keep us safe. They have to follow the rules set by the world to make sure everyone is okay.\nIt\u2019s crucial to remember that no one should ever be forgotten or left out. We all have the right to be protected and valued.\n\u00a9 L\u2019Arche/Warren Pot Nick Herd (right) and his colleague Warren Pot from L\u2019Arche Canada are interviewed at the United Nations.\nHuman rights for all\nWhy do humanitarian rights matter to me as a person with a disability? Human rights are not just words on paper; they are essential for people like me to live fulfilling lives and contribute meaningfully to society. I can think of three reasons why.\nGetting the help I need: Humanitarian rights ensure I can access essential resources and support services, like healthcare, education, jobs and tools tailored to my needs, helping me to live with dignity and independence.\nFeeling included: These rights promote inclusivity by fighting against discrimination based on disability. They ensure fair treatment for everyone, combating stereotypes and stigma. With humanitarian rights, society becomes more welcoming, where everyone's contributions are valued.\nSpeaking up for change: When it comes to conflicts, we know that people with disabilities are hit harder in wars. As part of L\u2019Arche, we have communities in places like Haiti, Bethlehem and Ukraine that experience this. Belonging to the supportive community of L\u2019Arche gives us solidarity, strength and resilience to come together during these difficult times. With the support of humanitarian rights, we can make sure that people with disabilities aren\u2019t forgotten when things get tough.\nRights and opportunity\nLiving a dignified life means having all the rights that make us human. Everyone should have the right to make choices for themselves, like what they want to do or where they want to go. We all deserve a safe place to call home and enough food to eat every day.\nUnited Nations COSP17 starts on Tuesday at UN Headquarters.\nCommunication is super important too! It\u2019s crucial that people talk to us in ways we understand. That way, we can express ourselves and be understood by others. And it\u2019s not just about talking. Everyone should have the same chances to get healthcare, go to school and find a job they love.\nGovernments play a big role in making sure these rights are protected, and it is so important to have our voices heard. People with disabilities deserve the support they need to live a happy, fulfilling life.\nCOSP is all about making sure that everyone, no matter their abilities, has a fair chance in life. It\u2019s a place to create change for the better.\nLet\u2019s work together to make sure everyone has the rights and opportunities we deserve.\nSee you on 11 June when I take over the UN News live blog. We\u2019re going live at 8am. I hope you will join us!\u201d\nStay tuned to UN News here.",

        "content": "title: 2. 3. 4. \n content: Legal Aid Bulletin for May 2024 The Legal Aid Working Group of the Protection Cluster, based on the analysis of information provided by its members1 and collected from open sources, identified the following current legal issues in May 2024.\n\n1.\n\n2. 3. 4.\n\nThe number of requests for monetary compensation from owners of destroyed housing located in the temporarily occupied territory has increased, as they expect that the eRecovery program on destroyed housing will be expanded to the temporarily occupied territories. On 25.04.2024, during the round table on \"Access to compensation for destroyed housing: problematic issues of confirmation of ownership rights and ways to resolve them\", it was stated that the experimental project (under the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers 1185 of 27 October 2023) of the Ministry of Infrastructure and UNDP to examine destroyed housing located in the city of Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia Oblast (temporarily occupied territory) through remote sensing using Earth technology was successful. The Head of the Parliamentary Committee on the \u2018Organization of State Power, Local Self-Government, Regional Development and Urban Planning\u2019, Olena Shuliak, and the Deputy Prime Minister \u2013 Minister for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk, noted plans to expand this program to other temporarily occupied territories in the future, including Mariupol and Bakhmut. Such plans are likely subject to funding support. The relevant draft law is registered in the Parliament (Verkhovna Rada), which is preparing for the second reading. The program would provide for the possibility of receiving compensation for housing located in temporarily occupied territories only in cases of destruction as determination of the degree of damage to housing based on satellite images is not possible. Owners of housing located in the temporarily occupied territory who acquired ownership before 2013 face problems when registering the right of ownership in the State Register of Property Rights (SRPR), even when hard copies of title documents are available. Registration of the property rights to the SRPR is a pre-condition to apply for compensation. The law obliges state registrars to receive the information necessary for state registration of rights from the relevant Bureau of Technical Inventory (BTI). Most BTIs in the temporarily occupied territories were not relocated to the territory under the control of the Government of Ukraine. Moreover, some of these BTIs were damaged, destroyed or looted. As a result, obtaining information from them is very difficult and generally considered impossible. Under such circumstances, the owners of such housing have to undergo a judicial procedure to recognize the right of ownership, paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof. It is common for notaries to refuse to open an inheritance case about property located in the temporarily occupied territory, likely due to the potential legal responsibility for such actions which would lie with the respective notary. The problem most often arises with private notaries, which have more discretion than state notaries, in particular in Vinnytsia Oblasts and in Kryvyi Rih City. As a result, the applicants (heirs) are forced to apply to the court to confirm ownership in the order of inheritance, paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof. The number of requests for technical documentation and cadastral numbers for plots of land for horticulture has increased rapidly. The Law on land plots allocation sets a deadline of 1 January 2025 for registering the ownership of a land plot, otherwise it will be considered that such owner or heir has refused to appropriate the land plot. In the absence of such ownership registration, the land will be considered as free and can be sold by the state to a new owner. At the same time, the legislator initiated amendments to this Law, extending the deadline for registration of land ownership until 1 January 2028. Amendments were passed in the parliament and await the Presidential signature. If the specified draft law enters into force, the number of such applications will probably decrease.\n\nThe Tenth of April, Right to Protection, East-SOS, Norwegian Refugee Council, Triangle G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Humanitaire, International Rescue Committee, Polish Humanitarian Action, Rokada, Legal Development Network.\n---\nAmendments to the Procedure for providing IDP Allowance, which entered into force at the beginning of 2024, caused an increase in the number of applications to ensure the continuation of payments of such allowance. The most relevant ones include:\n\n5. 6.\n\nFor the able-bodied population, employment is one of the eligibility criteria for receiving IDP allowance. The Departments of Social Protection (DoSP) take into consideration information on the payment of the Single Social Contribution (SSC) when deciding whether to consider an IDP as employed. However, payment of the SSC is not always a proper confirmation of employment. When the employment contract is suspended, the person is considered to be employed, but the SSC is not paid. Additionally, sometimes (in violation of the requirements of the law) employers do not pay the SSC for their employees. Therefore, the DoSPs may decide negatively on IDP allowance for an employed IDP in cases of no SSC payment. Partners report widespread verbal refusal to extend the payment of the IDP allowance, including in Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Rivne, Sumy, Vinnytsia, Volyn, and Zhytomyr Oblasts. In Vinnytsia Oblast, such refusals are reportedly communicated through private phones that are not associated with a specific DoSP, including via Viber. In Rivne Oblast, in response to a written request regarding the reasons for the refusal, the DoSP provided only a general reference to Resolution of the CMU No. 332 without explanation for the refusal in the individual case. It should be noted that in the Oblasts hosting large numbers of IDPs, there are still long queues for submitting an application to DoSP for reassigning of IDP allowances. For example, in Sumy Oblast, to submit an application, IDPs have to obtain a coupon from the respective DoSP or Administrative Service Centres to be accepted by DoSP for an IDP allowance review. As such coupons are issued in limited quantities, some people might not be able to submit an application for the continuation of the payment of IDP allowance. As a result, in overcrowded DoSPs and Administrative Services Centres, applicants are able to apply only after several days of attempts.\n\n7. 8. 9.\n\nThe Law on Court Fees provides that for establishing the fact of birth or death (or other facts of legal significance) that occurred in the temporarily occupied territory or in the combat zone, applicants are exempted from paying the court fee in all instances. However, in some cases from Dnipro, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, as well as in some courts in the northern oblasts of Ukraine illustrate, judges continue to request this fee. These judges justify their decisions by the fact that court fees in these cases are supposedly exempted only in cases where the death was caused by hostilities. Applicants often do not want to spend time and money on an appeal against such court decisions and turn to another local court to establish the relevant legal fact. Some judges, particularly in Dnipro when establishing the fact of death, demand the passport of the deceased to make sure that the deceased person is not a citizen of the Russian Federation. However, death must be confirmed and recognized by the authorities of the country where it occurred, as irrespective of the citizenship of the deceased individual. In Odesa, in order to apply to the court to establish the fact of birth or death, it is mandatory to obtain a rejection to issue a birth or death certificate from a Civil Registration Service, which contradicts the explanations of the Supreme Court.\n\nShould you have any questions, comments, or feedback, please do not hesitate to send it to azizian@unhcr.org",

        "content": "title: 53% of Ukrainian teenagers engage in risky behaviour despite being well-informed about risks posed by mines and unexploded ordnance UNICEF study [EN/UK] - Ukraine \n content: Kyiv, 6 June 2024 \u2014 A study conducted by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the Rating Group on explosive ordnance risk awareness and safe behaviour practices among Ukrainian parents and children aged 10 to 17 has revealed that boys aged 14 to 17 (62 per cent) and adolescents from rural areas and low-income families demonstrate the riskiest behaviours. Despite 97 per cent of adolescents surveyed claiming to be aware of mine safety rules, risky behaviour remains prevalent.\nThe study, conducted by UNICEF and the Rating Group research company as part of European Union (EU) humanitarian assistance, took place from March to April 2024 across 27 areas contaminated by landmines and unexploded ordnance.\nThe results of what is Ukraine's most comprehensive study on awareness and behaviour among adolescents and caregivers highlight a troubling trend \u2013 boys from mine-contaminated communities are particularly prone to risky behaviour. Boys aged 14 to 17 are the most likely to exhibit dangerous behaviour related to explosive ordnance (EO). They are more independent, spend more time away from home and explore new places. Additionally, adolescents from rural areas and low-income families face a higher risk of engaging in hazardous behaviour. In contrast, older girls with similar levels of awareness tend to follow safer behaviour around EO. Specifically, 48 per cent of girls are at low risk, compared to only 38 per cent of boys. \u0421hildren aged 10 to 13 years demonstrate the highest level of safe behaviours.\nMore than 90 per cent of the adolescents surveyed reported being covered by explosive ordnance risk education. Adolescents from the Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Kherson, Donetsk and parts of the Sumy regions demonstrated the highest level of awareness and knowledge of mine safety. In contrast, adolescents in contaminated areas of the Chernihiv, Kyiv and Zhytomyr regions showed lower awareness levels, similar to those in \u2018non-contaminated\u2019 central areas. The lowest awareness was found among adolescents from the western regions, where the threat of mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) is minimal.\n\u201cIt is important to understand that high awareness doesn't always equal safe behaviour,\u201d said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative to Ukraine. \u201cChildren who are informed about mine safety might still demonstrate risky behaviours. That is why UNICEF continues to implement behaviour change interventions with partners to foster a culture of safety among children, adolescents and their caregivers.\u201d\nKey factors influencing adolescents's behaviour:\nLeisure activities \u2013 Video games, especially shooters, reduce the perception of EO risk. Adolescents who spend much time online or playing computer games are more likely to engage in risky behaviour. Boys, in particular, often tend to play these games, which dulls their sense of real-life threats. At the same time, adolescents who spend their leisure time at home with their families, reading books or watching films are less likely to engage in risky behaviour. Despite more than 80 per cent of adolescents being aware of dangerous areas, a significant proportion from 'contaminated' regions still spend their free time in these risky places. High-risk behaviours during leisure time include spending time near ponds, lakes, rivers, etc (70 per cent), in forests and fields (70 per cent), on or near bridges, and railway tracks, and in destroyed and abandoned buildings (about 50 per cent), and on abandoned military positions or near equipment (30 per cent).\nLearning formats \u2013 Awareness-raising activities and lessons where edutainment formats are used help to safe behaviour. Adolescents who received information about mine risks through UNICEF cartoons and comic books exhibited the highest levels of safe behaviours. For instance, 59% of adolescents who viewed UNICEF cartoons and activity books displayed low-risk behaviour, while only 9% exhibited high-risk behaviour.\nParental involvement \u2013 Adolescents whose parents repeatedly discussed mine risks with them showed safer behaviours (50 per cent), compared to those whose parents rarely (32 per cent) or never (31 per cent) discussed these issues. This highlights the critical role of parental engagement in fostering safe behaviour among adolescents.\nMyths about mines affecting perceptions of safe behaviour \u2013 According to the qualitative phase of the study, a significant proportion of adolescents believe in common myths about EOs. These include misconceptions that using a mobile phone near a mine can trigger its detonation, that an EO will become inert after lying in the ground for several years, that it is safe to touch unexploded ordnance or detonated mines and approach anti-tank mines, and that mines can be touched carefully if sappers have already removed the TNT.\n\"Russia's war has already left Ukraine with a deadly legacy of explosive ordnance and mines, which will take decades to clear. Unfortunately, the situation is worsening each day, putting more lives at risk,\u201d said Claudia Amaral, Head of the EU Humanitarian Aid Office in Ukraine. \u201cThis is why the European Union is investing efforts and funds to clear Ukraine of deadly explosive traps and to raise awareness among Ukrainians, especially the youngest, about how to protect themselves from all the dangers of living in contaminated regions.\u201d\nThe study shows that educational institutions and parents are the primary sources of explosive ordnance risk education for adolescents. Children from contaminated areas receive this information mainly through their teachers, parents, State Emergency Service workers, the military and the police. While younger children are more likely to learn about EOs at school, from their parents or cartoons, older children tend to get information from social media, websites, rescue teams and the military.\nMinister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko noted: \"The study shows that altruism often drives risk behaviour. Adolescents try to help others in trouble \u2013 friends, acquaintances or animals \u2013 putting themselves at high risk, as where there is one mine, there are likely to be others. Most of the adolescents surveyed expressed a desire to provide first aid or rescue, rather than immediately calling emergency services. They forget that they are risking their own lives by approaching the affected or mined area. This underscores the importance of focusing our efforts on improving risk perception and promoting safe behaviour and practices.\"\nOver 80 per cent of young people in Ukraine can identify explosives. Adolescents also know better (67 per cent) than their parents (42 per cent) which number to call (101) if they see a dangerous object. It turns out that younger children know this number best. However, when it comes to warning signs of the threat of EOs nearby, only 55 per cent of adolescents from contaminated areas recognise the white and red tape as a mine warning sign, while the rest do not associate it with this threat, believing it to be a warning and prohibiting passage.\nAdditional information:\nFrom 2023 to 2024, together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, and the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, UNICEF informed over 8,000,000 Ukrainians about mine safety, engaging 1,500,000 million children and 500,000 caregivers in activities on mine safety rules. Children, adolescents, youth and their caregivers across Ukraine are learning life-saving rules through behaviour change campaigns, interactive community engagement activities and special projects, such as Mobile Safety Classes, cartoons and comics featuring Patron the Dog. UNICEF has also launched a special online course for educators, rescuers and police on how to deliver effective EORE messages to children and youth.\nAbout the study\nThe comprehensive study on mine safety awareness and safe behaviour practices among caregivers and children aged 10 to 17 was conducted from 16 to 25 March 2024. The study aimed to identify the factors that contribute to children's risk-taking behaviour with explosive ordnance and to identify these risk groups. Additionally, the role of caregivers, schools and other institutions in teaching children mine safety rules, mine risk awareness and safe behaviour practices were assessed.\nA total of 25,500 respondents were surveyed (12,750 parents and 12,750 adolescents), including a nationwide random sample (4,128 respondents) representative of families with children aged 10-17 years, and a booster random sample (21,372 respondents) representative of families with children aged 10-17 years from each of the 27 contaminated districts in the Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Chernihiv regions. The survey was conducted in all areas except for non-government-controlled areas and areas where mobile communication was unavailable at the time of the survey.\nThe Rating Lab research laboratory, professional child psychologists and social and behavioural change experts from UNICEF developed a test to assess knowledge of mine safety rules and identify risk behaviours in children aged 10 to 17. The test formed the basis of a quantitative telephone survey of parents and a quantitative online survey (test) of children. In addition, a series of focus group studies were conducted with children.\nMedia contacts\nDamian Rance\nChief Advocacy and Communications\nUNICEF Ukraine\nEmail: drance@unicef.org",

This has improved the security of the VHF radio network as well as real- time monitoring of all the remotes sites including Odesa, Mykolaiv, Dnipro, and Kharkiv. The only remaining site is Kramatorsk, where security challenges has entirely restricted access. The ETC will deploy the network equipment in Kramatorsk once the security situation is improved there.\n\nFrom 07 to 08 May, in response to an urgent request from local authorities in Odesa, the ETC set up temporary internet connectivity services for registration points and tents in Odesa opened by the local authorities for support to people affected by intensified shelling. The ETC used its existing Remote Site on Vehicle (RsoV) and satellite solutions to deliver the service. By 09 May, all community members were registered using the new network and the ETC service concluded.\n\nSituation Overview\n\nIn 2024, Ukraine has faced intensified attacks, resulting in increased civilian casualties and devastation in front-line areas and across the country, notably in the northeast.\n\nOn 14 May, speakers at the Security Council meeting condemned the intensified attacks on Ukraine\u2019s civilian infrastructure which has caused extensive damage to energy facilities, compromising water supply in certain areas, and disrupting electricity access for millions of civilians.\n\nAttacks on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant continue and are causing major safety concerns. Two hydroelectric power plants in Ukraine have been decommissioned following a major attack on 08 May.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports that approximately 3.39 million people have become internally displaced in Ukraine as of 31 March 2024. According to the United Nations High\n\nEmergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)\n\nwww.ETCluster.org\n---\nPage 2 of 5\n\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of 14 March, approximately 6.5 million refugees from Ukraine are recorded globally.\n\nThe humanitarian community estimates that 17.6 million people in Ukraine\u201440 percent of the country\u2019s total population\u2014and 4.2 million in refugee-hosting countries continue to need multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance.\n\nImpact on telecommunications\n\nThe TV tower in Kharkiv, which was destroyed during a strike on 22 April, is planned to be restored only after the end of hostilities.\n\nThroughout May, the Ukrainian Broadcasting, Radiocommunications & Television Concern (BRT) continued to prioritize the restoration of sites where tower infrastructure was damaged by airstrikes between 16 to 22 March.\n\nContinuing reports highlight significant disturbances to mobile and satellite telephony services in regions close to the frontlines.\n\nCyberattacks persist with varying impacts, affecting service availability in some cases, and targeting the unauthorized release of data in others. In May, Ukraine's Kyivstar allocated US$90 million to deal with the aftermath of the major cyberattack on telecommunications infrastructure that occurred in December 2023, which damaged infrastructure and disrupted mobile phone signals for millions of Ukrainians.\n\nETC Activities Coordination\n\nThe ETC coordinated two Telecommunications Security Standards {TESS+} training sessions which took place from 13 to 17 May and from 20 to 24 May with 36 participants from 12 UN agencies. The objective of the training was to build capacity and provide in-depth induction into UN security communications systems (SCS) for technical UN personnel. Participants gave positive feedback, noting critical new practical skills which will help organize their work in the field offices of UN agencies, especially in regions where UN operations and missions are particularly active. A video will be released on the training soon.\n\nSecurity communications (radio)\n\nVHF radio network\n\nEquipment is being procured to expand the VHF radio network across eight priority sites\u2014Kehychivka, Kropyvnytskyi, Mykolaiv, Orly, Pokrovsk, Poltava, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia. A preliminary technical assessment of these eight sites has been carried out. The collaboration with BRT aims to restore critical broadcasting services in affected areas and continue support in existing areas1.\n\nA joint mission was held from 29 to 30 May to the BRT tower site in Sumy, which was severely damaged in airstrikes on 07 March. The ETC, UNDSS, and WFP confirmed that significant restoration of the site has taken place, and it is now ready to host the ETC\u2019s VHF radio network.\n\nThe deployment of network firewall equipment donated by partner\u2014Cisco Crisis Response\u2015to support and secure the VHF radio network in Ukraine was completed in May. This has improved the security of the VHF radio network as well as real-time monitoring of all the remotes sites including Odesa,\n\n1 Existing VHF radio coverage provides secure communications services beyond the common operational areas of Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Lviv, and key locations close to the frontline in Kramatorsk, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Luch, and Kherson. Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) www.ETCluster.org\n---\nPage 3 of 5\n\nMykolaiv, Dnipro, and Kharkiv2. The only remaining site is Kramatorsk, where security challenges has entirely restricted access. The ETC will deploy the network equipment in Kramatorsk once the security situation is improved there.\n\nDuring the power cuts experienced in Kyiv in May, the ETC verified the resilience of the power back-up system provided to the Remote Security Operations Centre (RSOC). The results and monitoring tools confirmed that the SOC radio and internet connectivity set-up remained operational throughout the power cuts. Similarly, mitigation actions were taken in Kharkiv on 21 May to improve the reliability of the security communications system during power cuts. The mission included upgrading the power back-up system for remote site equipment, which now can sustain up to 20 hours in case of a power cut.\n\nThe ETC raised the height of the VHF radio repeater antenna in Odesa to expand coverage within the city. Additionally, VHF coverage was assessed in the Odesa warehouse area where there is a repeater to seek recommendations to enhance base radio access. Unfortunately, there was no coverage improvement in the warehouse area after extending the antenna. Further actions are being explored.\n\nFinally, the ETC resolved the VHF interference issues at the BRT radio repeater site in Dnipro.\n\nRadio training & programming On 09 May, the ETC conducted two SCS training sessions for 20 UNICEF and 14 IOM personnel in Odesa.\n\nOn 30 May, UNHCR and ETC delivered SCS training for 15 IOM personnel in Chernivtsi.\n\nTo book security communications training sessions, please use this link. ETC radio programming services can be requested through a ticketing system via email: ukraine.etcservicedesk@wfp.org\n\nRemote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) project\n\nThe ETC is working to establish a Long-Term Agreement (LTA) with a local supplier to standardize the procurement process and facilitate Remote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) procurement for the ETC and its partners in Ukraine. Offers have been received, and a technical evaluation is underway.\n\nWith ETC support, UNFPA has completed one Remote Site on Vehicle (RSoV) kit. The ETC will support with kit testing and user training. The UNFPA kit will be deployed in the eastern operational UNFPA sites in Ukraine and it will also be used for inter-agency convoys.\n\nThe ETC tested and deployed one WFP armoured vehicle RSoV kit and one OCHA armoured vehicle pre-cabled with RSoV to cover SCS needs for inter-agency missions in Kharkiv. The cluster trained WFP and OCHA personnel on how to operate the solution.\n\nThe RSoV pre-cabling of the 18th Logistics Cluster truck is finalized and tested.\n\nTelephony Throughout May, the ETC conducted several tests on satellite phones in areas where they are used by humanitarians as part of the security communications system in Ukraine. Low reliability of the Iridium network in Kyiv, Dnipro, and Odesa has been escalated to the network provider by the ETC. Up to 10 attempts were needed to register and perform calls on the network.\n\n2 During the project, the equipment has been deployed also in the UNDSS-managed primary SIOC in Kyiv and back-up Remote Security Operations Centre (RSOC) in Lviv. Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) www.ETCluster.org\n---\nPage 4 of 5\n\nHigh reliability of the Inmarsat network was found on the road from Kyiv to Kharkiv. More tests are planned\u2014the ETC will provide a final report and recommendations to UN partners on the use of Inmarsat satellite phones in Ukraine.\n\nSecure data connectivity\n\nThe ETC continues to support data connectivity services in the inter-agency hubs in Odesa, Kharkiv, and Mykolaiv.\n\nThe ETC remains committed to safeguarding its connectivity services and employs advanced firewall protection implemented in collaboration with partner\u2015Cisco Crisis Response.\n\nServices for communities\n\nFrom 07 to 08 May, in response to an urgent request from the local authorities in Odesa, the ETC set up temporary internet connectivity services for registration points and tents in Odesa opened by the local authorities for support to people affected by intensified shelling. The ETC used its existing RSoV and satellite solutions to deliver the services. By 09 May, all community members were registered using the new network and the ETC service concluded.\n\nOn 20 May, a field assessment was initiated by the ETC in shelters in schools in Yuzhne, Odesa, to determine the reported gaps in internet connectivity services. This comes in response to a request made in March by the Education Department to support this activity in the Odesa region.\n\nIn response to a request from the local authorities, a need for enhanced communication tools and internet connectivity was identified in the Mykolaiv region. The aim is to link mental health and rehabilitation centres with local medical and social services, particularly for the affected population including displaced persons in remote communities. Assessments are ongoing to establish telecommunications services to facilitate health care access and support. On 20 May, a meeting was held with local IT specialists in Mykolaiv regarding the network infrastructure.\n\nDashboard See the ETC Dashboard for an overview of service locations.\n\nFunding\n\nIn 2024, the ETC in Ukraine has a budget requirement of US$1.5 million to continue to deliver vital communications services.

Strategic capacity-building support in cash coordination, design and implementation 2. Focus on the Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies 3. Two pilot programmes are underway for this workstream 4. CashCap expert is embedded in and collaborating closely with the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) 5.

Findings heavily rely on interviewee perceptions. Timing of Review: Clarity on pilots' contribution to CashCap's localisation objectives will emerge once experts depart their contexts. Differentiating Pilot from Experts: Key informants struggle to provide unbiased feedback due to personal relationships with experts.\n---\nFindings\n---\nFindings Relevance\n\nHow relevant were CashCap's expert deployment and partner selection in pilot countries\n\nWhile most interviewees were not aware of the rationale behind the selection in their country for the pilot, all informants in Syria and Ukraine considered the pilots to be extremely relevant to the contexts chosen.\n\nThe interest in CVA capacity-strengthening and the willingness to assume a leadership role in cash delivery was paramount for both NS. When coupled with their pivotal roles within their country, these elements underscore the relevance of the selected contexts.\n\nThe missions and objectives captured in the ToRs matched the requirements on the ground.\n\nThe BRC\u2019s established rapport with SARC positively influenced the perception of the deployment's relevance as well as its effectiveness\n\nThe experts deployed successfully adjusted to the NS\u2019 needs and priorities throughout their deployment, thus increasing the relevance of the pilots.\n\nExamples of areas of focus not part of the initial ToRs: Syria: Focus on CVA earthquake response and coordination Ukraine: Focus on co-chairing the CWG\n\nThe ToR drafting process appeared to have been relatively opaque. This did not impact the effectiveness of the deployments, nor does it question their relevance per se.\n\nShare of KI who know / don\u2019t know why their country was selected for the pilot Don't know\u2026 Know 60%\n\nA number of factors contributed to the perceived relevance of the deployment: the perceived neutrality of the expert, the length of deployment, and the interpersonal and technical skills of the experts deployed.\n---\nFindings\n\nHow effective were the pilots in supporting local and national organizations in the two contexts?\n\nEffectiveness\n\nOverall Effectiveness\n\n\u2022 Technical expertise, interpersonal skills, and deployment duration significantly influenced the pilot's effectiveness. Experts' knowledge of cash coordination and extensive experience in cash and voucher assistance (CVA) were crucial. The duration of deployment, typically one to two years, allowed experts to grasp contextual nuances and ensure continuity, especially in Ukraine. Some RCRC interviewees noted experts' superior technical strength in CVA compared to delegates, leading to significant internal coordination roles.\n\nCoordination and Advocacy\n\n\u2022 Effective deployment positioned both SARC and URCS in external coordination forums, notably Cash Working Groups. \u2022 In Ukraine, URCS attained co-chair status in the CWG, facilitated by the expert's leadership and training efforts. \u2022 In Syria, SARC's external coordination strengthened, with increased collaboration within the CWG and improved negotiations with clusters. \u2022 The expert played a crucial role post- earthquake in Syria, enhancing the NS's visibility and understanding of external coordination mechanisms.\n\nIn turn, this positively contributed to the visibility and empowerment of both NSs, which is a direct outcome of localisation. Both SARC and URCS took on more significant roles in external coordination structures. Interviewees underscored that this enhanced their visibility and empowerment in the NSs.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made in coordination, the extent to which it is sustainable remains to be seen.\n\nOne of the unintended positive outcomes of the pilot was the contribution to effective internal coordination between the NS and the Partner National Societies.\n---\n\u201cBecoming co-chair gave URCS a push to up their game\u201d\n\n\u201cSARC\u2019s interaction with the CWG has changed significantly since the expert was deployed\u201d\n\n\u201cSARC is the most active participant in the technical working group under the cluster system\u201d\n\n\u201cInternal coordination massively improved in 2023 vs. 2022.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing co-chair gave us visibility with donors and international organisations. Combined with the fact that we were a big cash actor, it gave us CVA legitimacy.\u201d\n---\nFindings Effectiveness\n\nHow effective were the pilots in supporting local and national organizations in the two contexts?\n\nQuality CVA at scale NS' ability to implement quality CVA at scale improved in both countries during the deployment period. Experts significantly contributed to this improvement, particularly in documentation development and information management enhancements. In Ukraine, despite progress, some interviewees feel the NS isn't fully cash ready, citing a gap in understanding at branch level and the absence of sectoral cash for URCS\n\nSyria - Harmonizing CVA tools\n\n- Integrating cash components into sectoral tools used by various departments within SARC\n\n- Supporting CVA and Information Management (IM) departments within SARC in establishing the CVA database\n\n- Contribution to the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for CVA and Livelihood activities\n\n- Expert's crucial role during earthquake response, mobilizing full team within days and securing significant funding\n\nUkraine\n\n- Implementation of a no-regret cash in envelope for 270,000 recipients for 2 weeks for the Ministry of Reintegration and Occupied Policy\n\n- 100,000 recipients per month for host community members hosting IDPs between Sept 2022 and December 2023 (start of the program in June 2022)\n\n- URCS as the sole partner of the government since September 2022, handling registration, payment, PDM, and CEA\n\n- Voucher support to 50,000 people with PNS assistance\n\n- Quality and accountable delivery ensured through adequate systems and procedures (verification, monitoring, CEA, reporting, Cash Platform, etc.)\n\n- Transition from blanket approach to vulnerability targeted approach - MOUs established with government\n---\nFindings\n\nHow effective were the pilots in supporting local and national organizations in the two contexts?\n\nEffectiveness\n\nCVA skills and Competence \u2022 Experts significantly enhanced CVA skills and competence in both Syria and Ukraine, leading to substantial improvements. \u2022 All interviewees appreciated the experts' soft skills and mentoring approach. \u2022 Majority of interviewees noted the cash team's strong willingness to learn, contributing to positive outcomes. \u2022 Key elements for skill enhancement included daily teaching and mentoring, collective capacity-building activities, and quality feedback and reporting. \u2022 Challenges remain in turnover and sustainability, with staff turnover and \"brain drain\" common. \u2022 Debate arose regarding the expert's impact on improving capacities and systematic ways of working, particularly in SARC and Ukraine's CVA unit.\n\nEvidence of Progress \u2022 Lack of clear objectives for experts before deployment and within host countries. \u2022 Limited awareness of overarching goals, as seen in Syria. \u2022 BRC established a work plan for experts in Syria, but many interviewees were unaware of it. \u2022 In Ukraine, Cash expert reported directly to Deputy Director of Programmes, addressing URCS priorities. \u2022 Despite the cash strategy in URCS One Plan 2023\u20132025, no detailed work plan was developed. \u2022 Absence of defined outcomes not viewed negatively by most KIs; seen as adaptable. \u2022 Challenges include determining deployment duration and devising exit strategies. \u2022 Missed opportunity in Ukraine to utilize Red Cross' CVA self- assessment tool for tracking progress.\n---\nLearning and Replicability\n---\nLearning\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nLessons Learned & Recommendations for Model Effectiveness and Future Scale-up\n\nMethodology\n\nFindings\n\nLearning\n\nReplicability\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nExit Strategy\n\nExtension of the pilot is crucial for consolidating capacity-strengthening efforts in Syria and Ukraine, with most interviewees advocating for at least another year, preferably two. Factors influencing duration and exit strategy include internal factors such as cash readiness and expert coaching approach, along with external factors like staff turnover and funding availability.\n\nChallenges persist without baseline and endline assessments for decision- making. Insights for an effective exit strategy include progressive exit with remote coaching, light-touch reviews for recommendations, and a one-month handover between experts.\n\nLearning about the pilot\n\n\u2022 Interviewees, especially in National Societies (NSs), advocate for structured deployment with clearer objectives and increased involvement in expert selection. While agility in adapting to emerging needs is praised, about half suggest a more structured approach for future deployments. \u2022 Some NS interviewees emphasize the importance of interpersonal skills and seek involvement in setting objectives and expert selection. \u2022 Limited NS involvement was observed in drafting Terms of Reference (ToRs) and expert selection in Syria and Ukraine. In Ukraine, there's a proposal to involve NS and CashCap directly in decision-making and ToRs drafting, with regular partner check-ins.\n\nDeployment facilitated significant knowledge exchange, benefiting both experts and CashCap. Initially not part of the review matrix, this aspect was added after discussions with Norcap, highlighting its significance in the context of localization. Experts, regardless of prior Red Cross exposure, shared examples of benefits, including enhanced internal coordination within the Movement and a deeper understanding of local actors' challenges in the humanitarian sector and NS role with the government in both countries. The pilot design and expert identification provided insights into the importance of selecting experts motivated for long-term roles with national actors and the need to adapt recruitment processes to screen for mentorship and 'leading from behind' qualities.\n---\nReplicability\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nMethodology\n\nModel Effectiveness and Future Scale-up Findings Learning Replicability\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nThere was a consensus among interviewees globally, including in Syria and Ukraine, emphasizing the critical nature of deploying and embedding a CashCap expert within a National Society (NS), suggesting this model's effectiveness for future implementation in diverse contexts.\n\nJustification for CashCap's involvement includes the requirement for local actors to either act as or have the potential to be key cash response entities, with less than a quarter of interviewees in Syria and Ukraine seeing potential for other local actors.\n\nThe embedment of an expert offers a unique value proposition for NSs, enhancing relevance and demonstrating replicability potential through expertise in large-scale CVA design and implementation, in-depth understanding of expectations and practices of other actors, neutrality compared to PNS CVA delegates, and proficiency in CVA coordination. While the first characteristic is not exclusive to CashCap experts, the combination of these attributes is deemed unique.\n\nReplicability involves prioritizing NSs where deployment will be most effective, considering factors like large-scale emergencies with extended response durations and preparedness and anticipatory action where NSs play a pivotal role as government auxiliaries.\n---\nReplicability\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nMethodology\n\nModel Effectiveness and Future Scale-up Findings Learning Replicability\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nThe main limiting factor to replicability is CashCap\u2019s ability to deploy the right expert and to commit the expert for a minimum duration of one year \u2022 Minimum deployment duration favored by most interviewees: One year, allowing for operational readiness.Less than a year raises concerns about deployment value for about half of interviewees. \u2022 Interviewees from NSs and PNSs don't prioritize immediate deployment due to the understanding of time required for expert selection. Strong expectations exist for CashCap to send highly qualified experts\n\nMixed views within the Movement about the need for the expert to have experience working with the RC \u2022 Approximately one-third deem RC experience mandatory, while others prioritize relevant context and crisis experience alongside interpersonal and technical skills.\n\nRegional Perceptions: \u2022 Perception consistency across countries despite varying expert RC experience. \u2022 Greater emphasis on RC experience in Ukraine due to crisis novelty and PNS coordination challenges. \u2022 Potential underrating of RC experience need in Syria due to SARC's embedment support from BRC.\n\nPNS vs. NS Perspective: \u2022 PNS prioritize movement experience, while NS prioritize knowledge of external actors. \u2022 Suggestions for on-the-job coaching to mitigate lack of RC experience.\"\n---\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that someone outside couldn\u2019t bring value to it, but it definitively helps to have lived it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving Red Cross experience is not needed, but a \u201cRed Cross induction\u201d from the CashCapper to a new one would be useful (3 days training for example).\u201d\n\n\u201cWe overstate the importance of having movement experience to understand the movement. It\u2019s much more about effective relationship management than understanding of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be mandatory to send someone with Red Cross experience.\u201d\n---\nConclusion and Recommendations\n---\nConclusion\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nThe review demonstrated the relevance and effectiveness of this pilot and calls for the replication of the scheme in other contexts\n\nMethodology\n\nFindings\n\nLearning\n\nReplicability\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nInterviewees affirmed the effectiveness of deployment and integration within URCS and SARC, attributing it to expert skills, deployment duration, neutrality, and adaptability\n\nEmbedding a CashCapper presents a unique value proposition for NSs and local actors, showcasing technical expertise, soft skills, and adaptability\n\nThe pilot significantly boosted capacity, particularly in implementing quality CVA at scale and coordinating effectively\n\nSustainability challenges, especially in Ukraine, necessitate a gradual exit strategy with at least another year of deployment\n\nFuture replications should clarify CashCap's role with NSs and involve them in needs identification and expert recruitment for effective replication\n---\nRecommendations\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\nMethodology\n\nDetermine CashCap's annual deployment capacity based on available experts to prioritize target NSs effectively\n\nUtilize self-assessment exercises by NSs' CVA units, when available, to measure deployment effectiveness and contribution to localisation, maintaining deployment adaptability without setting rigid objectives upfront\n\nExplore a mixed deployment model spanning three years, with the expert's full- time presence in the first year, followed by shorter-term missions in subsequent years to enhance sustainability and continuity\n\nFindings\n\nLearning\n\nConsider involving more NS/PNS actors in the expert selection process to increase accountability and ensure a participative approach in line with localisation principles\n\nConsider a model where NSs contribute financially to deployments, demonstrating commitment to CVA preparedness and hosting the expert.\n\nExplore setting up a system where NSs can apply for deployments, ensuring a participative approach. Develop eligibility criteria considering factors like cash readiness and contextual needs.\n\nReplicability\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nClarify CashCap's positioning towards NSs at their request: Is CashCap a partner communicating directly with NSs? Improve communication to ensure NSs are well-informed and create open channels for discussion.\n\nStructure CashCap's support to NSs, including monitoring, to document lessons learned and benefits gained from expert deployments into NSs in future monitoring and evaluation (M&E) efforts.\n\nWhen deploying an expert without RC experience, provide support to ensure a thorough understanding of movement functions for effective deployment.\n---\nFollow up discussion: Q&A",

        "content": "title: MULTI - SECTOR NEEDS ASSESSMENT ANNEX REPORT | PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES \n content: Trebi\u0161ov, Slovakia. Ukrainian refugee with a disability received support and assistance from UNHCR. \u00a9UNHCR/Veronika Pelik\u00e1nov\u00e1\n---\nThe focused analysis of the 2023 MSNA on disability followed the recommended Washington Group Short Set (WG-SS)4 of questions, with a total of 1.853 individuals participating as a group of proxy respondents who were asked if any household (HH) member had visual, hearing, mobility, cognition, self-care, and communication difficulties. Based on data analysis, the\n\nreport presents an analytical comparison on three main strata: households with not reported disability in the household (HH- no-pwd), households with at least one member with reported disability 2 or above5 (HH-cut-off-2), and household with at least one member with reported disability 3 or above6 (HH- cut-off-3), as per the graphic below:\n\nProfile & needs overview\n\nThis section discusses the demographic profile and outlines articulated needs of the interviewed households' members, including a comparison between the reported difficulties and the level of severity.\n\nThe assessment covered a total of 819 households (HH) with 1.853 members, of whom 36% of them reported at least one member with a disability level 2 or above and 13% of HH reported at least one individual with disability 3 or above. In addition, a total of 21% HH members reported disability 2 or above and 6% reported disability level 3 or greater.\n\nRegarding the described difficulties across all age groups, the most cited were visual limitations, followed by mobility difficulties. A total of 58% of household members over 60 years old reported having more disabilities, mostly physical and visual problems. It is worth noting that, as per global data, more than 46% of older persons worldwide \u2013 those aged 60 years and over\u2014reported having disabilities (see more on intersection of age and disability in conclusions).7\n\nAmong children, 10% reported to experience some kind of difficulty. The majority of those children reported difficulties with seeing (60%), while other reported difficulties with walking and communicating at relatively high level (17% and 15% respectively). As presented in the table below indicating distribution by age group of household members reporting disabilities, at any severity level, the majority of physical or mental impairments appear in the oldest age group.\n\nFurther in-depth analysis provides information on the different difficulties and the level of severity for each of them. Visual limitation was the most reported condition with a low level of severity, while remembering and self-dressing were less reported with a higher severity level.\n\nPriority needs The 2023 MSNA highlighted specific priority needs for the refugees coming from Ukraine, including about access to healthcare services, employment and livelihoods, language courses, accommodation options, food and medicines. A comparative analysis of data between those HH with at least one member with disability and HH with no member with disability shows that slightly more priority needs were reported by the former group (between 86%-89%), compared to the latter (81%). While reported needs in the group with no members with disability were widely spread, the most cited priorities needs for HH with at least a person with disability were healthcare services and medicines. An interesting observation which needs to be further explored is the fact that accommodation and employment/livelihood was reported as a problem by less HH with disabilities than in those without members with disabilities. An explanation could be based on the provided support by the Government to those persons with disabilities under the Temporary Protection (TP) scheme.\n\n4 Washington Groups Short Set (WG-SS), online 5 Disability level 2 or above: the level of severity of a difficulty reported by a person is \u201csome difficulty\u201d, \"a lot of difficulty\" or \"cannot so at all\". 6 Disability level 3 or above: the level of severity of a difficulty reported by a person is \"a lot of difficulty\" or \"cannot do at all\". 7 Ageing and disability | United Nations Enable https:/ /www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/disability-and-ageing.html\n---\nEducation\n\nEnrolment of refugee children with disabilities or special needs in the formal education system continuous to be challenging in Slovakia. From the total HH interviewed, the sample for children with a disability remained too low to run an analysis and therefore secondary data and sources are used to provide some views in this regard.\n\nThe Rapid Situation Analysis and Needs Assessment of Ukrainian Children with Disabilities elaborated by the Platform of Families with Children with Disabilities informed that \u201c(as Ukrainians) used to a more integrated school system back home, Ukrainian parents often aim to enroll their children with disability in a regular school. They are often surprised at the very low number of regular schools that integrate children with disability in Slovakia\u201d.8 As the Platform further reported, \u201cfamilies may not disclose their child\u2019s diagnosis in order to facilitate their enrollment in school or their integration in the wider society\u201d. Additional information provided by the study presented important concerns frequently cited by parents regarding lack of disability-adapted early childhood and formal education capacities. In addition, bullying remains an important concern raised by parents of children with disabilities.\n\n\u201c\u2026Lessons for kids with autism or other development disability are very expensive, you need all your salary, and sometimes is not enough \u2026\u201d\n\nParent of a child with autism, in a focus group discussion in Bratislava.\n\nAs per the most updated data provided by the Ministry of Education9 as of end of December 2023, a total of 96 refugee children from Ukraine were enrolled in formal education in special schools for children with special needs, compared to the total of 11.818 refugee children enrolled in formal education the academic year 2023/2024.\n\nProtection\n\nDifferences were identified in the comparative analysis of the reported awareness of protection services in the area of residence. In general, HH with no person with a disability reported being more aware of protection services (mainly state social services), than those with a member with disability. Only awareness of psychosocial support services was slightly higher in HH with a member with disability 3. This outcome indicates a strong need for more targeted information provision focusing on specific disability-related services.\n\nDe facto use of social services is rather low; according to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MOLSAF) information, only 46 persons persons with specific needs, including persons with disabilities, were residents in social service facilities.10\n\nAdditional analysis on social cohesion presents possible tensions with the host community reported by respondents. In general, HH with a family member with a disability reported a slightly higher percentage of hostile behavior from the host community.\n\nRather positive results were received in relation to assistance provided, including on information for available services as well as in-kind support. Among the total number of HH with at least one member with disability (295), only between 14% and 17% of HH reported not having received any assistance in the last 3 months11. In terms of satisfaction, HH with a person with disability presents higher satisfaction levels, between 74% and 76%, and only between 6% and 8% of households with a member with disability reported dissatisfaction with the assistance received. Only between 6% and 8% of households with a member with disability reported dissatisfaction with the assistance received. The high satisfaction might be related to multi-purpose cash and material need assistance provision available for persons with disabilities, particularly provided by MOLSAF. According to the information provided by the Ministry, disability cash assistance was provided in 2023 to 1.308 TP holders in the overall amount of 506.284 EUR.12\n\n8 Platform of Families with Children with Disabilities / UNICEF: Rapid Situation Analysis and Needs Assessment of UA Children with Disabilities and their Families - online 9 Ministry of Education: enrolment of children from Ukraine - online 10 Data provided by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and the Family of SR upon reguest. 11 This refers to any kind of assistance provided by humanitarian actors, government, or other entities. 12 Data provided by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and the Family of SR upon reguest.\n---\nIn particular, respondents were asked if they encountered any challenges accessing information needed (including information on rights and entitlements, access to services). Generally, HH with a member with disability reported facing more challenges accessing information, mainly due to a lack of knowledge of available sources of information. That finding was also raised during focus group discussions with parents of children with disabilities. This can represent a challenge for humanitarian actors for diversification and better targeting of information provision, given that persons with disabilities and older people might have limited access to online tools provided e.g. through applications and web-portals and/or because, overall, do not have knowledge of using information and communications technology (ICT).\n\nThe area of access to information is also highlighted in the analysis of the Platform of Families with Children with Disabilities. According to the analysis, \u201c\u2026the government together with international and community-level organizations should address the informational barrier that carers face in access to healthcare, education, social benefits, etc. In an often-changing legislative environment, working on periodic and timely informational campaigns that target not only Ukrainian carers but also local practitioners and social workers assisting this demographic is crucial in making the already available services more accessible.\u201d.13\n\nWith regards to awareness of available services to reach out to and the possibility to report cases of violence against children in the community, HH with a person with disability reported higher awareness on those services, between 97 and 99%, compared to HH without a person with disability (95%). In addition, between 69% and 73% of HH with a person with disability reported awareness on how to access gender-based violence services available in Slovakia, compared to the 73% reported by HH without a person with disabilities.\n\nEconomic vulnerability & livelihoods\n\nOverall, persons with disability reported lower education level in comparison to those with no reported disability; higher percentage was obtained on secondary and vocational education on individuals with disability, and master\u2019s degree was more cited by persons with no disability. No major difference was identified on the comparative analysis for high education level, such as Ph.D. and Grand Ph.D., as this level is quite rare. However, more than 75% of persons with disabilities reported having secondary or higher education level which could translate into a high level of employability in Slovakia.\n\nIn terms of employability, nearly a third of persons with less serious disability reported being out of the labor market, compared to those with no disability (i.e., persons with serious medical conditions, on parental leave or students), which is comparable to the overall situation in the European Union where the labour market participation of persons with disabilities still presents a challenge; only half of persons with disabilities are employed, compared to 3 in 4 persons without disabilities.14 Of the rest of the sample, the analysis presented higher results reported on employment on individuals with no disability.15\n\n\u201c\u2026Persons with disabilities cannot work in many cases; they need extra cash assistance and support for example to cover the costs of prothesis, wheelchairs\u2026\u201d\n\nAdult person during a focus group discussion in Opatovska Nova Ves\n\nInformation available from the focus groups discussions pointed out the challenges faced by caregivers in finding employment, particularly for mothers, which can revert on situations of isolation from the rest of the society. Additionally, families with children with a disability may face additional financial burden to provide for therapies, as presented in the analysis of the Platform of Families with Children with Disabilities:\u201c\u2026many families experience financial hardship due to the cost of care for their child with disability and are seeking extra income.\u201d.16\n\nNOTE: Employed are those of working age (15-64 years) who are employed, have their own business, or work in a family business; unemployed are those of working age (15-64 years) who are looking for work and at the same time are ready to start work within 14 days; outside the labor market are those of working age who do not fall into the above categories (typically persons with serious medical condition, on parental leave and students who do not work).\n\n13 Platform of Families with Children with Disabilities / UNICEF: Rapid Situation Analysis and Needs Assessment of UA Children with Disabilities and their Families - online 14 European Commission; Employment, Social Affairs & Inclusion; Persons with disabilities - online 15 No analysis was run for HH members \u2013 cut-off 3 due to the low number of working-age HH members in this strata 16 Platform of Families with Children with Disabilities / UNICEF: Rapid Situation Analysis and Needs Assessment of UA Children with Disabilities and their Families - online\n---\nRegarding the social protection systems17, data show positive results on benefits coverage depending on the type of HH. In general, HH with a person with disability reported being benefited in a larger scale, while between 47% and 37% of HH with a person with disability reported being covered by the Slovak social protection system. This presents a significant difference compared to HH without members with disability (15%) which is easily understandable, as the Slovak social protection system is designed to support the most vulnerable groups, with a specific cash assistance to persons with disabilities. Similar results were obtained on the benefits received from the Ukrainian social protection system, however, only 4% of HH without a member with disability reported being covered by this assistance. This percentage differs in the case of HH with a person with disability, which represents between 17% and 14%.\n\n\u201c\u2026Financial support related to disability in Slovakia is a complex and long-term process\u2026\u201d\n\nAdult person during a focus group discussion in Trnava\n\nThe comparative analysis shows that HH with a person with disability tend to make less use of financial services, such as a bank account or an account at a formal financial institution in Slovakia. Between 76% and 70% of respondents reported using this kind of services, compared to the 80% of HH without a member with a disability. This would require a more focused analysis to see if there are some institutionalized challenges in the financial services (which might be a case of a discrimination in the provision of services and/or access to those services), or if persons with disabilities are less interested to use them.\n\nIn addition, regarding changes on the HH 2023 income compared to 2022, HH with a person with disability reported more negative balance, compared with the other type of HH.\n\nOverall, regarding the analysis on food consumption, the majority of HH obtained an acceptable food consumption score (FCS)18 result with around 93% in the case of HH with a person with disability. Nevertheless, the comparison of borderline or poor food consumption score presented higher results on HH with a person with disability (7%), compared to the 3% in the case of HH without a member with disability.\n\nIn addition, with the aim to measure the hardship faced by HH due to a shortage of food, the survey included the Reduced Coping Strategies Index (RCSI)19 information, which measures the frequency and severity of food consumption behaviors the HH had to engage in due to food shortage in the 7 days prior to the survey.\n\nOverall, regarding the situation of persons with disabilities in the European Union, over 28% of persons with disabilities are at risk of poverty or social exclusion compared to over 17% of persons without disabilities.20\n\nResults from the comparative analysis in Slovakia presents that HH with a person with disability are more likely to adopt coping strategies, with special attention on crisis and emergency coping strategies, such as degrading source of income (illegal work or high-risk jobs), double compared to the other type of HH.\n\nNOTE; At governmental level, refugees from Ukraine with severe disabilities and their caregivers can apply for humanitarian aid subsidy provided by the Ministry of Labour, social affairs, and family21. The degree of serious disability is assessed by social workers of the Ministry following a questionnaire based on WHODAS22. The humanitarian aid provided can be from 300 \u2013 508 euros per month depending on the degree of severity (40-59% or 60% or more respectively).\n\nHealth Access to healthcare services was reported by HH as first priority need23, even higher for HH with a person with disability (see first part of this section). Moreover, the study shows healthcare needs were cited more in HH with person with disability, but also less challenges when accessing the required services.\n\n17 Social protection system covers benefits (e.g. maternity leave, pensions, material need benefit (d\u00e1vka v hmotnej n\u00fadzi)). 18 Food Consumption Score FSC: online 19 Reduced Coping Strategies Index (RCSI): online 20 European Commission; Employment, Social Affairs & Inclusion; Persons with disabilities - online 21 Ministry of Social affairs and family, Subsidy to support humanitarian aid to a person with special protection in connection with their serious disability: online 22 WHODAS \u2013 WHO Disability Assessment, measuring health and disability: online\n---\nAdditional sources of information24 presents the lack of pediatric and specialized care as the main concern, together with the insufficient complementary health care and health aids coverage. Respondents also mentioned temporary visits to Ukraine for diagnostics, treatment or to seek health aids, due to the unavailability on accessing healthcare services in the country. Disrupted treatment, rehabilitation and daily routines are common concerns reported during focus group discussions, on top of the additional barriers faced by all refugees, such as language.\n\n\u201c\u2026My daughter was receiving rehabilitation sessions in Ukraine.

Generally, more mental health and psychosocial problems were reported by HH with a member with disability (between 54% and 44%), compared to the 22% reported by those HH without a member with disability.\n\nAccommodation\n\nResults from the analysis reflected own accommodation25 as the most common type of accommodation cited by respondents at the time of the interview. The comparative analysis shows that HH with a person with disability 3 or above are less likely to stay in collective sites such as existing building (schools, community centers).\n\nAdditional information from the Site Mapping and Monitoring exercise26, including in particular data of 45% of the total collective sites surveyed in October 2023, reported not being accessible for persons with disabilities. Regarding the facilities at the sites, 35% of sites reported not having showers accessible and 47% in the case of shower facilities. In addition, 72% reported not having equipment for persons with disabilities and/or older persons such as wheelchairs, scratchers, etc. Overall, 35% of sites reported the need to be adapted for persons with disabilities.\n\nAlmost half of the respondents reported having secured tenure for a period of 6 months or more. The analysis shows HH with a person with disability reported less uncertainty compared to those without a person with disability, which can be explained on the need to secure an accessible space or which can be explained due to options on accommodation provided by authorities to HH with persons with disability.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe MSNA - Annex Report on persons with disability indicates that access to health is the top priority need reported by all type of households (HH), specially by those with a person with disability.27 However, those HH continue reporting also basic needs, such as for medicins and food, among priority needs. This highlights that, still, some of the basic needs are not met by refugees and in particular among HH with persons with disabilities. Considering that, as per the MSNA results, access to employment and language courses remain among the top priority needs for the overall refugee population, thus, the findings for those with disabilities indicates considerable needs in connection with their vulnerabilities.\n\nIn addition, it can be observed that HH with a person with disability are exposed to more vulnerabilities and challenges towards their inclusion in the host community. Children with vulnerabilities face major barriers in accessing education28, thus severely limiting their prospects of accessing lifelong learning and livelihoods opportunities. HH with a person with disability are more likely to adopt negative coping strategies (56% on HH with a person with disabilities, compared to 39% on HH without persons with disabilities), and are more at risk of economic vulnerability, such as lower income, lower employability and limited access to financial systems which may result in higher poverty rates and social exclusion.\n\nYet, HH with a person with disability presented less challenges in accessing the healthcare system; which it can be related to their need of using frequently this type of services, being more awared and familiarized with them, or living in an accommodation type where health services are provided (as Humenne). However, families often have to cover costs of these services, in addition to the provided assistance. Moreover, challenges on access to health services are still reported in connection to disruptment of treatments and language barriers, among others. Mental health and psychosocial problems remain critical, as half of the HH with a person with a disability reported such problems.\n\n24 Rapid situation analysis of the needs of children with disabilities and their families from Ukraine; online 25 Own accommodation including rented apartments, houses, guesthouses, etc 26 Site Mapping and Monitoring; Joint initiative of UNHCR and IOM, supported by SHC, which aims to obtain updated information on the situation, priority needs and available services on the accommodation sites, to better inform humanitarian response; online 27 It will be important to follow this trend after September 2023, when the Ministry of Health expanded access to universal healthcare for all temporary protection holders from Ukraine. 28 Rapid situation analysis of the needs of children with disabilities and their families from Ukraine; online\n---\nAge and Disability\n\nPersons with disabilities face a number of obstacles including attitudinal, environmental and institutional barriers preventing their full and equal participation in all aspects of life. Often older persons with disabilities are among the most adversely affected, facing further age barriers in society.28\n\nThe intersection of aging and disability is a multi-faceted topic that impacts individuals, society, and service delivery. The experience of disability and aging is multi-factorial and dependent on wider social, cultural, structural, and environmental factors. As such, examining the connections between disability and aging may contribute to more nuanced understandings to improve well-being and quality of life and enhance service provision.29\n\nImprovement of the accessibility to information on refugee rights for the different types of difficulties, including official sources, remains an important gap in the response. Some good examples are oberserved on websites with \u201cread aloud\u201d functionality, such as the initiative \u201cFrom Ukraine to Slovakia\u201d30. However, a further in-depth survey would be necessary to understand the hindrances HH with a member with disabilities may be facing in the access to information. This might also indicate isolation and a lower level of inclusion in local communities, which is unfortunately the case in the domestic population as well.\n\nIn addition, better planning and responses requires official disaggregated data on refugees with disabilities, on needs, barriers, additional cost of living, as well as the available support and type of participation and inclusion opportunities of children, adolescents and persons with disabilities. In this connection, apart of the sectoral information on education and health, it is critical to facilitate evidence-based planning for humanitarian actors and other stakeholders.\n\nMany of those priorities are reflected in the UKRAINE SITUATION REGIONAL REFUGEE RESPONSE PLAN 2024 for Slovakia. The strategic objective 2 calls for action so that \u201cRefugees with specific needs and vulnerabilities have access to targeted support and assistance.\u201d A tailored and inclusive approach is followed by RRP partners which continue to complement the government-led efforts, working with experts in the field for the protection and assistance to persons with specific needs, and build capacity for specialized services and support, along with an increased access to information about these services. RRP partners will continue engaging based on the key principles of disability inclusion: (i) non-discrimination; (ii) awareness; (iii) participation; and (iv) accessibility. In addition, cooperation will be further promoted with national and local organizations working with persons with disabilities, as well as municipalities to ensure that initiatives and good practices can be further supported within local communities.\n\n28 Ageing and disability | United Nations Enable - online 29Understanding the Nexus Between Aging and Disability to Enhance Aging Well for All | SpringerLink - online 30 From Ukraine to Slovakia joint platform developed by Mareena and HRL: online\n\nTHE MSNA WAS CONDUCTED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF: Designed and developed by the UNHCR-led inter-agency MSNA Task Team:",

Purpose of this document\n\nThe purpose of this document is to compile in one place the necessary information for planning, monitoring, and reporting Shelter Cluster Activities included in the HNRP 2024. It describes the intended outcome for each proposed activity, identifies the most suitable indicators for each activity, recommends modalities of assistance, shows the reference cost, and provides instructions for ensuring coherence in activity reporting among different partners. This document does not replace the Shelter Cluster technical guidance and should be read together with those.\n\n2. Objectives\n\nBelow are the objectives framing the activities included in the HNRP 2024. Strategic objectives are common to all sectors, whereas cluster-specific objectives pertain to shelter and NFI sector activities.\n\nStrategic Objective SO1: Provide principled and timely multi-sectoral lifesaving assistance to internally displaced people, non-displaced people, and returnees, ensuring their safety and dignity.\n\nCluster Objective CO1: Provide life-saving shelter and Non-food item (NFI) support to conflict-affected IDPs, returnees, and non-displaced people.\n\nCluster Objective CO2: Deliver emergency shelter and NFI assistance mitigating the impacts of harsh winter weather for IDPs, returnees, and non-displaced people while minimizing environmental impact.\n\nStrategic Objective SO2: Enable access to basic services for internally displaced people, non-displaced people, and returnees.\n\nCluster Objective CO3: Ensure adequate housing solutions for IDPs, Returnees, and non-displaced people while fostering linkages to longer-term response.\n---\n3. Activity Matrix The matrix illustrates the activities the Shelter Cluster recommends for each sectoral objective.

Geographical Context\n\nThe context determines which activities and forms of assistance are most appropriate. The nature of the crisis is geographically specific. As such, four different zones have been established to frame the expected intervention in each location.\n\nContext 1 refers to areas that are regularly attacked and, therefore, require emergency activities. While there are attacks all over the country, these are locations where attacks are recurrent, access to infrastructure and services is affected, and normal life is severely disrupted. It corresponds to the front line and the Russian border oblasts. The area within 20 kilometers of the Russian border and within 30 kilometers of the front line is considered high-risk and deserves special attention. Context 2 refers to areas receiving displaced people from other locations that require an effort by the authorities and humanitarian agencies to provide shelter and services. Services and housing stock, although functional, are under stress due to increased demand. This situation occurs in virtually every Oblast of the country. Context 3 pertains to areas where the Government of Ukraine (GoU) is regaining control. These are regions that have been under occupation and on the frontlines of war, where infrastructure and services have been severely affected. The remaining population has endured highly challenging conditions, and returning residents struggle to regain access to housing, services, and livelihoods. Context 4 refers to areas not under government control, where humanitarian access is extremely limited, needs assessment capacity is very low, markets are non-functional, and last-mile distribution poses a challenge.\n---\n5. Targeting, Prioritization & Vulnerabilities\n\nFor operational purposes and as a guideline and recommendation for the partners, Shelter Cluster outlines the recommended principles for targeting and prioritization in this chapter.\n\nTargeting approaches Humanitarian assistance can be delivered through either a blanket or a targeted approach1. Shelter Cluster demonstrates an example of a standard procedure for targeting as a decision tree in Annex A. To achieve a targeted approach, four key components contribute to appropriately prioritized targeting: Geographical Prioritization, Preconditions, Activity Specific Vulnerability, and Individual/Household Vulnerabilities. This chapter aims to define each of these components.\n\nGeographical Prioritization A variety of geographical factors can affect the prioritization of activities chosen for that location. For example, limited access, proximity to conflict zones, or onset emergencies following attacks can all impact the process. To address this, the Shelter Cluster has outlined the relevant Geographical Contexts",

Of these, 3.8 million people were targeted for assistance in the southern, eastern, and northern oblasts bordering the front line. Along with service delivery, and the procurement and distribution of medicines and supplies, cash and voucher assistance has been one of the accepted modalities of providing health assistance by health partners as stated in the HNRP.\n\nSince the launch of the HNRP in December 2023, air strikes have intensified in areas nearest the frontline and those bordering the Russian Federation. As of January 2024 the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has worsened significantly. Waves of attacks have had a devastating impact on the health and well-being of civilians, disrupting critical services for hundreds of thousands of people at the peak of winter. Throughout this period, areas originally targeted for humanitarian assistance in regions including Kharkivska, Khersonska, Kyivska, Mykolaivska, Odeska, and Zaporizhzhia have been heavily affected, and people continue struggling to access basic services, intensifying the demand for humanitarian aid.\n\nFrom Jan \u2013 Mar 2024, some 9,700 attacks were recorded.1 As of 09 April 2024, official records documented 31,366 civilian casualties.2 Ongoing attacks on health facilities and schools have had profound consequences, severely hindering access to essential healthcare other basic services. The May 2024 offensive in Donetska, Kharkivska, Khersonska, Sumska oblasts, has resulted in further displacement as civilians are fleeing to safety. As partners respond, the need to provide guidance on the use of Cash and Vouchers in health has become acute as a result of the increased vulnerability of the people in need.\n\nThe Ukrainian Health System\n\nHumanitarian actors in Ukraine operate in a space where emergency health services are offered in tandem with national health services. These services vary in availability and accessibility depending on local conflict dynamics. In Ukraine, citizens are guaranteed a package of health services provided at no charge at the point of delivery according to the constitution. Within the national health system, the Ministry of Health (MOH) develops and approves quality standards/clinical protocols, while issuing licenses to those engaged in health care service delivery, the production and sale of medicines and equipment. Within the scope of the Law on State Financial Guarantees of Health Care, the National Health Service of Ukraine (NHSU) purchases packages of services (Program of Medical Guarantees). Each facility then contracts for the services they have the capacity to provide, and for which they must meet contract requirements and specifications defined by the NHSU for each specific package of services. Currently, the NHSU pays for all services, provided these are recorded in the eHealth system, without imposing any service caps or waiting times, and according to the tariffs and payment methods defined in the Cabinet of Ministers Resolution regarding the PMG for the given year.\n\nThe main component of the health system reform has been the strengthening of primary health care. Ukrainians can choose a family doctor, pediatrician or general practitioner at any health facility across the country that has a contract with the NHSU. Patients enter into a contract with the chosen doctor by signing a Patient Declaration Form.3 The declaration is an application form that confirms that the patient is being served by the chosen physician and is funded for care as per the PMG at the health\n\nUkraine Situation Report. Last updated 24 May 2024 (OCHA). UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) Ministry of Health Ukraine.\n---\nfacility where the physician works. This contract enables doctors to diagnose, treat, write prescriptions for medicines (including those that are included in the Affordable Medicines Program (AMP), and refer patients for specialist care. Primary health care providers are reimbursed per capitation, adjusted for age and terrain, for the number of patients registered with them, as well may receive additional financing for meeting specific vaccination and NCD related indicators. Since 2019, once a physician reaches a specified optimal number of individuals with declarations (family doctor \u2013 1800 declarations, pediatrician \u2013 900 declarations and therapist\u2013 2000 declarations), the NHSU pays a lower capitation rate for any additional person to mitigate the risk of oversized patient panels.\n\nWhile the MOH and NHSU have continued to function throughout the war \u2013 not stopping services or payment for a single day, the overall functionality of the health system, has been impacted by attacks on health care and critical infrastructure, lack of medicines in pharmacies, rising costs of medicines, health care worker shortages in frontline communities, and issues with transport.4 To respond to the war related strains on the health system, adjustments have been made to the services covered in the PMG and medicines included in the AMP. For example, in 2022 additional services such as providing mental health care at the PHC level and providing complex rehabilitation services were included in the PMG. With regards to the AMP, the program now accepts paper-based prescriptions and allows internally displaced patients to receive medications without obtaining a new prescription or receiving a prescription from a PHC doctor who they do not have a declaration signed with. Recently, the NHSU broadened the AMP to include painkillers for palliative care patients, immunosuppressive drugs and test strips for determining blood glucose levels in type I diabetes.5 In 2024, the AMP will further expand to include additional medicines for the treatment of mental health conditions. To increase access to medicines, mobile pharmacies were launched in rural and frontline communities in Cherkasy, Kharkivska, Mykolaivksa, Kyivska, and Chernihivska regions. A pilot project \"Ukrposhta.Pharmacy\", launched to enable people to receive medicines by mail in Chernihivska, Donetska, Kharkivska, Khersonska Mykolaivska, Sumska, and Zaporizhzhia regions.6\n\nService availability and gaps\n\nDespite innovations to address wartime strains on the health system, challenges still remain regarding the provision of Universal Health Care, ensuring that everyone can access their right to health care when needed. In frontline oblasts, health care is impeded by security constraints, transport, and infrastructural challenges.\n\nSince the escalation of the war in 2022, the Health Cluster team through the WHO Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care has verified 1,814 attacks on health care in Ukraine as of June 2024, with 143 deaths and 342 injuries to health care workers and patients. Attacks on health care deprive vulnerable populations of urgently needed care, undermine health systems, and endanger long-term public health goals.\n\nA recent WHO survey conducted in the frontline areas of Dnipro, Donetska, Kharkivska, Khersonska, Mykolaivska, Odeska, and Zaporizhzhia found that approximately 10% of the population lacked consistent access to primary healthcare services (10% in June 2023, 9% in September 2023). Households with members having chronic conditions and children reported even greater difficulties, with 16% experiencing access issues. The primary challenge for those with chronic conditions was financial barriers to treatment, medication, and diagnostics, affecting 42% of this group. The cost of services increased as a barrier from 29% in June to 37% in September 2023. Although the majority of respondents (87%) reported having access to pharmacies within a 30-minute walk, 10% faced challenges in obtaining medicines, primarily due to availability issues (41%).\n\nUkraine Health Cluster: Health Context and Response Update (September 2023) [EN/UK]\n\nThe Affordable Medicines Program Is Helping Ukraine Achieve Health Equity Despite the War Affordable Medicines Programme: what are the development priorities for 2024?\n---\nThe most recent round of data collection in April 2024 (results not yet published) revealed improvements in access to primary healthcare, with only 6% unable to reach a family doctor. However, 19% of those with chronic conditions still faced access issues, up slightly from 16% in December 2023, with financial constraints remaining the main barrier. Pharmacy access remained stable since December 2023, but access to medicines improved over the last three months, increasing from 16% to 25%. Nonetheless, 9% still faced issues, primarily due to price and availability. Additionally, 16% of respondents experienced problems obtaining prescribed medicines in April 2024, with cost (26%) and availability (19%) being the main barriers.\n\nCash and voucher assistance for health in tandem with supply side inputs to the health system through humanitarian health action has the potential to reduce financial barriers (and mostly for the vulnerable groups), there is an opportunity to use this modality in addressing health outcomes and reducing costs to accessing health services. Positioning Sectoral Cash and Voucher Assistance in Health\n\nSeveral assessment findings have highlighted an increase in household expenditures on health (mostly related to the purchase of medicines) since the 2022 escalation of the war. This is evidenced by the 2nd round of the Multi-Sector Needs Analysis (MSNA, 2023), the WHO Health Needs Assessment (HNA 3), and other surveys repeated to gauge population\u2019s perceptions on health and barriers to services, including financial ones.\n\nThe Ukraine humanitarian response has followed up commitments put forth in the Grand Bargain to prioritize cash assistance where possible. Although assessments highlight beneficiary preferences for cash, there\u2019s no guarantee that recipients will use the health portion of Multi-Purpose Cash assistance (MPCA) to meet health needs. MPCA cash is unrestricted and can be used for other household needs and services prioritized by the beneficiary. Furthermore, health needs can be costly, unpredictable, and thus challenging to be met through recurrent MPC payments. Allegations of corruption from both out- of-pocket and informal payments in health only reinforce cash in health as a sensitive topic.\n\nTo provide guidance and organize the implementation of cash and voucher assistance in health, the Health Cluster is adopting a sector-specific approach to inform the process, taking into account the challenges which exist while capping the volume of emergency (HNRP) support, which can be implemented using a voucher approach. Sectoral cash and voucher assistance in health shouldn\u2019t disrupt regular functioning of the health system but should complement it with a clear phase-out strategy incorporated during the planning process.\n\nUkraine CVA for Health Framework conceptual model\n\nThe Ukraine CVA for Health Framework is informed by the Tanahashi framework, a conceptual model used in public health to assess bottlenecks and improve access to health care services. The framework identifies five dimensions that contribute to health care access: availability, accessibility, affordability, acceptability, and quality. Figure 1 demonstrates how CVA for health can remove the barriers individuals might face in accessing health care services in areas affected by the war.\n\nThe complexity of health services delivery in front line and hard-to-reach areas demonstrates the need to consider integrated programming, in which CVA is considered complementary to supply side and government health financing rather than a replacement. Integrated programming acknowledges that health outcomes are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond access to health care services. Cash and voucher assistance can help address socio-economic determinants of health, such as lack of transportation, which may hinder an individual\u2019s ability to effectively seek and use health care services.\n\nTable 1 identifies tools to assist in the barrier analysis/ assessment stage of the design, and inform the development of appropriate CVA for health interventions.\n---\n|    | 0                                                       | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  0 |                                                         | Barrier                                                                                                                                                                                            | Health assessment tool/data source                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|  1 | Availability of services                                | ActivityInfo (5W) Assessments: Health Cluster Assessment Tracker: here HeRAMS Ukraine: Accessibility to essential health services in priority oblasts: here Attacks on healthcare: here PHSA: here | Partner presence mapping Partner assessment, ongoing monitoring Assesses the availability of health facilities, providers and services, as well as their functionality.

Medication/health service selection with oblast health authorities Partner pre-engagement prerequisites\n\nThe choice of health services to be covered as part of the CVA programming in health should be informed by evidence. The examination of available secondary sources of information to confirm/affirm the need for such services (as well as their relevance) should be conducted. Some readily available sources include; MoH health statistics, HeRAMs, PHSA, MSNA, different health assessments among others, which incorporate information on the health gaps.\n---\nA more detailed contextual assessment (by a partner) to deepen the body of available information while zooming in on the problem to confirm its\u2019 relevance in the contemporary moment should be conducted. The focus of such an assessment should not rely solely on gaps related to the investigated problem but examine opportunities which can be seized to contribute to finding solutions. Such opportunities could relate to existing frameworks/services within and outside the public sector. Situational analyses should also incorporate aspects relating to social determinants affecting the availability and accessibility of desired health services.\n\nFindings from the review of secondary data and contextual assessment should be presented to local health authorities and CVA for Health Task Team with suggestions of how CVA can meet the health needs without disrupting the existing health system. Synergies with existing programs and approaches should be clarified (e.g. CVA facilitating access to medicines should demonstrate how the approach complements Affordable Medicines Program (AMP), Mobile Pharmacy Initiative and UkrPoshta pharmaceutical delivery, etc.). A phase-out approach should be clarified as part of the process.\n\nTable 2 demonstrates how CVA for health can complement national health care in areas that are heavily affected by the war.\n\n|    | 0                                                                                          | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 3                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  0 | Program of Medical Guarantee (PMG)                                                         | Conflict related barriers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Demand                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Humanitarian Intervention Supply                                                                                                                                             |\n|  1 | Primary Health Care Primary Health Care Mental health care on primary level TB care on PHC | Health facility destroyed, health facility not accessible (e.g. insecurity, distance), shortage of health professionals due to conflict No family doctor Shortage of MH professionals due to conflict Shortage of assistive products (wheelchairs, glasses, prosthetic limbs, white canes, and hearing aids) Simple laboratory, diagnostic tests                  | Voucher for treatment and transport to nearest PHC Voucher for treatment and transport to nearest PHC Voucher for assistive products Voucher for treatment and transport to nearest PHC                                       | Mobile outreach medical unit (mobile) Mobile outreach medical unit (mobile, fixed) Mobile outreach medical unit (mobile, fixed) Mobile outreach medical unit (mobile, fixed) |\n|  2 | Rehabilitation Inpatient rehabilitation Outpatient rehabilitation Rehab for children U3    | Health facility destroyed, health facility not accessible (e.g. insecurity, distance), shortage of health professionals due to conflict Shortage of rehab professionals due to conflict Transportation, accommodation for treatment to rehab facilities in Kyiv Medications for rehab not included in the AMP Rehab PMG incomplete (including assistive products) | Voucher for treatment and transport to nearest health facility Voucher for treatment and transport to nearest health facility Voucher for transport, and accommodation for duration of treatment Vouchers for medication n.a. | Mobile outreach medical unit (mobile, fixed) Mobile outreach medical unit (mobile, fixed) n.a. n.a.

Vouchers in healthcare therefore, must aim at facilitating access to services for a specific pre-identified category of beneficiaries (including vulnerable persons) who would be unable to access these services without such planning. Where patients must travel long distances to access health services, and transport and accommodation represents a barrier, the organization facilitating CVA should make arrangements which favor transportation of patients, while remaining accountable for expenses related to such transportation effort.\n\n3.\n\nApproach, choice of medicines and existing health system\n\nHigh levels of inaccessibility to medicines and laboratory tests have been flagged during country level assessments, which have informed the Health Cluster\u2019s classification of the severity of health needs for the affected population. These results indicate the inability of those most affected by the war to access health services and medications in front line communities.\n\nIn response to these gaps, humanitarian actors have been inclined to facilitate access, enabling health care availability in communities most affected by the war. While partners delve to provide immediate solutions, the approach should aim at fostering the use of mechanisms set by the MoH where available, including facilitating access to the AMP through mobile pharmacies, UkrPoshta and other means. Health partners should encourage patients to access national services provided free-of-charge where the war has not rendered such services damaged or destroyed.\n\nPartners making arrangements should adhere to the following principles:\n\nPromote the use of the Ukrainian AMP pharmacies, UkrPoshta and Government Mobile pharmacies where services are available and not absent due to the war. Primarily encourage the use of medicines provided/mentioned under the above government frameworks. Avoid programming which encourages patient access to medicines outside government frameworks when these or their equivalents are available. Only temporarily cover gaps of services (medicines) not available as part of the government framework, by making arrangements for these using a voucher system with a third-party provider. Such patients should be identified and mapped prior to initiating the health project.\n---\nCash assistance to patients to procure medicines themselves should be avoided. Where transportation is required, modalities avoiding direct cash transfer is encouraged and the partner facilitates these using existing transportation networks. Maintain flexibility to accommodate transition to the existing government frameworks at the earliest time possible.\n\n4.\n\nAccess to medicines for patients facilitated by CVA health partners should only include those categories and specialties on the Essential Medicines List (EML) of Ukraine, and avoid prohibited medicines. Partners will be required to discuss locally with the local departments of health to provide evidence on the consideration of medicines from the EML list.\n\nVulnerability and targeting criteria\n\nWhile all of Ukraine has been affected by the ongoing war, the Cluster\u2019s estimation and analysis of needs shows a decreasing severity of humanitarian needs as the distance from active hostilities increases, while those in the southern, eastern, and northern oblasts bordering the front line are more severe. Amid these populations, certain characteristics can intersect and result in an affected person having less access to health care services.\n\nBelow are some common targeting criteria that may intersect, and considerations that health actors may use when designing CVA for health.\n\nHealth status: Households in the frontline oblasts targeted by the HNRP experiencing a health need directly or indirectly related to the war. Individual status: The elderly and people with disabilities, who have difficulties in accessing health care, pregnant women children, who are at risk of several health issues, people without documentation in need of health care services. Household and individual characteristics: o Larger households with more dependents may be given priority o Female-headed, disabled person headed households o Vulnerable older people and persons with disabilities, children without caretaker or family support Persons who are not entitled for formal pension, having no source of income. o Geographical criteria: o Remote or conflict-affected regions where access to healthcare facilities is limited or non-existent and alignment with HNRP severity levels 4.4 or greater. o Locations with a high concentration of displaced persons or refugees, where healthcare resources may be strained. Disability: Person being identified via the Washington Group (WG) Short Set of Questions (more information here), persons with disabilities group 1, 2 and 3 as per the Ukrainian system: understanding barriers people with disabilities may face, needed medication and health needs in close combination of understanding where CVA may meaningful support safe access. Social status: Access to healthcare services for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and ethnic minority groups can be challenging due to various socio-economic, cultural, and structural barriers. CVA for health can improve access to health care for these communities, leading to better health outcomes and greater equity in healthcare delivery. Gender: Consider gender dynamics to ensure that assistance reaches and benefits all individuals equally. Program design should incorporate strateg",
