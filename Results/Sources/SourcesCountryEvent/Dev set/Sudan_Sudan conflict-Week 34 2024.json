We also remember our colleagues who have been lost, both within the WHO family and among our partners. Their sacrifices weigh heavily on our hearts.\nThis year, we draw attention to the alarming trend of attacks on humanitarians and aid workers\u2014an unacceptable reality we must confront. Even in times of conflict, there are rules to uphold. Attacks on healthcare violate international humanitarian law, depriving individuals of lifesaving services when they need them most and, even worse, stripping them of hope.\nOne attack is one too many. Yet, in regions such as Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, and beyond, assaults on healthcare have become disturbingly common. So far this year, WHO has verified 720 attacks on healthcare in 13 countries, resulting in 355 deaths and 647 injuries\u2014impacting ambulance drivers, health workers, patients, and their families. Each statistic represents a life disrupted, a family torn apart and a community left to grapple with loss.\nToday, we honour those we have lost and the legacy they leave behind. We extend our respect and gratitude to those who, even now, risk their own lives and health in service to others. They exemplify the values of service, professionalism, integrity, collaboration, and compassion that define our mission at WHO.\nIt is essential to remember that humanitarians are not only those who operate in high-risk areas. WHO, as a humanitarian organization, means that all of us are humanitarians. Each of us plays a vital role, regardless of our position or location. There is no hierarchy of importance\u2014only a division of labour.\nI want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all colleagues, both at headquarters and around the globe, for your unwavering commitment to the vision that has guided us for 76 years: the right to the highest attainable standard of health for all people as a fundamental human right.\nThis is the right we tirelessly strive to promote and protect, wherever, whenever and however we can.

Over 70 million people are in immediate need of humanitarian assistance.\nIn Ethiopia, the humanitarian situation remains dire.

Over 4.5 million people are internally displaced across the country. At the same time, the country hosts more than one million refugees, including recent arrivals from Sudan. In parallel, and sometimes in the same locations as other crises, there are outbreaks of infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera and measles.\nSomalia remains one of the major humanitarian crises in the world, with close to 7 million people in need of life-saving assistance. While still recovering from a historic drought, the country was severely hit by above-average rainfall and flooding during the 2023 and 2024 rainy seasons, forcing thousands of people into displacement and triggering cholera outbreaks in new locations. A projected La Ni\u00f1a effect and dry spells later in the year will likely have worrying consequences for the already serious food insecurity situation in the country.\nFinally, South Sudan is experiencing a sharp economic crisis this year, while the conflict in neighbouring Sudan is also increasing displacement and the vulnerability of the population.

Last year was the deadliest on record for aid workers, with 280 people losing their lives. A majority of those killed were in Gaza, where Israeli Defense Forces operations have taken a devastating toll on those responding to the humanitarian crisis. The United Nations recently described Gaza as the \u201cmost dangerous place in the world for aid workers,\u201d and in my own engagements with partners working there, aid workers have consistently described the conditions and dangers they face as among the worst they have ever seen throughout decades of responding to crises.\nAt the same time, the need for aid workers is growing as global humanitarian crises continue to worsen.

Far from protecting and facilitating humanitarian aid, militaries have repeatedly obstructed and endangered it. Global efforts to address the problem of violence against aid workers through UN resolutions and international media campaigns like #NotATarget, have also not managed to slow the continued upward trend of global casualty numbers.\nThis year\u2019s Aid Worker Security Report examines the challenge faced by aid workers attempting to practise humanitarian advocacy: how and where it has been effective, when and why it has failed, and what risks it potentially poses to personnel and operations.\nSummary of key findings\n- 2023 was the deadliest year for aid workers ever recorded, with fatalities more than double the annual average.\n- The death toll was driven mainly by the war in Gaza, which, since its onset in October 2023, has claimed the lives of more than 280 aid workers to date, mostly in collateral violence.\n- Sudan and South Sudan also saw record numbers of aid workers killed in 2023, adding to the spike in fatalities.\n- The changing global conflict landscape has seen the proportion of aid worker killings committed by state actors rise relative to non-state armed groups. That those who are supposed to uphold international humanitarian law are increasingly responsible for the deaths of aid workers and civilians highlights the challenges and limits of humanitarian advocacy.\n- At the country and regional levels, humanitarian advocacy efforts have had little evident success in achieving better access and protecting aid workers in current conflicts, and global humanitarian advocacy campaigns have not curbed the upward trend of aid worker casualties in conflict.\n- When aid organisations confront the behaviour of powerful actors, it can sometimes put aid personnel and programming in danger. However, neither the risks nor the effectiveness of aid organisations \u2018speaking out\u2019 are well demonstrated or understood.\n- While the security risks of advocacy can be better mitigated through improved coordination, organisational processes, and risk analysis tools, more significant rewards remain out of reach \u2013 dependent on the international political will to apply pressure for accountability and justice.", "27539": "title: Aid trucks cross Chad-Darfur border via Adr\u00e9 \n content: Aid trucks cross Chad-Darfur border via Adr\u00e9\nMore than a dozen trucks carrying humanitarian aid crossed from Chad into Darfur, Sudan, yesterday, according to a statement by the World Food Programme (WFP).

It is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.\nThe cholera outbreak is the latest calamity for Sudan, which was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group exploded into open warfare across the country.\nThe conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum and other urban areas into battlefields, wrecking civilian infrastructure and an already battered health care system. Without the basics, many hospitals and medical facilities have closed their doors.\nIt has killed thousands of people and pushed many into starvation, with famine already confirmed in a sprawling camp for displaced people in the wrecked northern region of Darfur.\nSudan's conflict has created the world's largest displacement crisis. More than 10.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes since fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. Over 2 million of those fled to neighbouring countries.\nDevastating floods\nThe fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the UN and international rights groups.\nDevastating seasonal floods in recent weeks have compounded the misery. Dozens of people have been killed and critical infrastructure has been washed away in 12 of Sudan's 18 provinces, according to local authorities. About 118,000 people have been displaced due to the floods, according to the UN migration agency.\nSudan at 'cataclysmic breaking point' amid multiple crises, UN warns\nCholera is not uncommon in Sudan.

Last year, 163 aid workers were killed in attacks. In 2024, 121 aid workers have been killed in OPT, according to the database. This year, Sudan was the next most dangerous country with 12 aid workers killed, and eight have been killed in South Sudan.\nNahed Abu Iyada, Health Program Field Officer for CARE West Bank and Gaza, said: \u201cThe biggest challenge for me as an aid worker is the lack of safety and security. Right now, no one in Gaza is safe. International humanitarian law is not being respected and we can be attacked at anytime, anywhere, and without any warning.\nAbu Iyada added: \u201cThe lack of security is taking a toll on our wellbeing. Now, we live in tents or overcrowded shelters, struggle to find enough food and water for our children, and cannot sleep due to the constant sound of bombing. There is never a second of respite.

Their contributions to youth empowerment, women\u2019s representation and peace building are appreciable, however, addressing challenges associated with power dynamics and ensuring access to resources is crucial for them to continue to play a transformative role in the changing political scene. I once again would like to stress the importance of collective progress that will not happen without them, as well as recognizing their potential to shape a more inclusive and equitable future, not only necessary at this stage, but must be coupled with adopting a sacred approach for involving them in political processes and interactions, driven by an open heart, and addressing their concerns which are marred by a history of manipulating their dreams and the aspirations of those they represent.\nIn today\u2019s dynamic setting, a new era is dawning, bringing numerous opportunities and challenges, and at the forefront is the potential to empower youth, injecting fresh and vital perspectives into the political arena, including through initiatives focused on mentorship and leadership training that can pave the way for active youth participation in decision-making processes.\nAt the same time, the strides in women\u2019s representation point to a promising opportunity for greater empowerment. Knocking down gender barriers and dismantling discriminatory practices will be pivotal. In the world of peace building, they find themselves at a crossroads with a critical opportunity. Their participation in peace processes is a key to addressing the root causes of conflict and promoting lasting reconciliation. Strategies that include conflict resolution training and cooperation with international actors are critical to achieving success. However, amidst these opportunities lie challenges. Hence, the complex dynamics of power and influence, and their intersection with their justifiable ambitions, must be addressed to create a more inclusive political setting, which requires overcoming resource constraints by establishing strategic partnerships and increasing funding, as well as ensuring that marginalized voices are amplified. Gender disparities remain a challenge, requiring sustained efforts to remove systemic obstacles. Initiatives that support women in leadership roles and enforce gender equality policies are critical steps forward. In addition, effective representation of marginalized communities remains a key point, as do proactive measures that include local community leaders, and how they constitute a guarantee of a diverse and representative political fabric.\nTo enhance the effectiveness of intermediary leadership, it is recommended that a multi-faceted approach, in which initiatives prioritize comprehensive training, particularly in the areas of political, legal and electoral awareness, negotiation and conflict resolution, and proposed policies, to enable leaders to bridge gaps and facilitate dialogue. The call for policies that promote inclusive representation should be amplified, with a focus on gender equality and its implementation, resource mobilization efforts, including international cooperation, can alleviate financial constraints. Multiple youth empowerment programs and community engagement strategies are pivotal to promoting a favorable political environment, and pressure on \u201cde facto\u201d authority should be continued so as to respect human rights, accompanied by public awareness campaigns to highlight the positive and inevitable influence of the champions of democracy, and immediately begin building a political front to end the wars and to launch a new transition, of which they constitute the centerpiece.\nTo be continued..\n* Researcher at the Public Policies Institute-Sudan, Wednesday, December 13, 2023.", "37006": "title: War-ravaged Sudan battles cholera epidemic \n content: War-ravaged Sudan battles cholera epidemic\nLying on a hospital bed, Aisha Mohammed said she is \"suffering\" from cholera symptoms, an increasingly common ailment in Sudan where a prolonged war has ravaged the healthcare system.\nCholera, caused by contaminated water or food, had been common in Sudan particularly during the rainy season even before war broke out in April 2023 between rival generals.\nBut more than 16 months of fighting have forced most hospitals out of service, leaving the country of 48 million people struggling to control the sometimes deadly but treatable disease.\nIn the southeastern Sudanese town of Wad al-Hulaywah, 40-year-old Mohammed receives intravenous medicine to ease her crippling symptoms.\n\"I'm suffering from acute diarrhoea,\" she whispered.\nSudanese authorities and the United Nations have reported a surge in cholera cases amid several weeks of torrential rains that have battered parts of Sudan and displaced thousands.\nRains and floods have contributed to a resurgence of the largely waterborne disease, which can cause severe dehydration and lead to death within hours if not treated.\nThe health ministry on Monday declared an epidemic, later reporting 556 cholera cases including 27 deaths, most in Kassala state where Wad al-Hulaywah is located.\nNearby Gedaref state has also been hit particularly hard, the ministry said.\nThe World Health Organization said Sudan has had at least 11,327 cholera cases, 316 of them deadly, since June 2023.\nSudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said \"climatic conditions and water contamination\" were behind the epidemic.\nIn Wad al-Hulaywah alone, \"we've counted 150 cases so far, among them seven dead\" since late July, local health official Adam Ali told AFP.\n- 'Polluted water' -\nBefore the start of the war between Sudan's army and paramilitary forces, the UN had said that about 40 percent of Sudanese did not have access to clean water. Conditions have since worsened.\n\"Our problem is drinking water,\" said Ali.\nMost residents of Wad al-Hulaywah \"drink water directly from the river -- polluted water\", he said.\nDuring the rainy season, large amounts of silt are washed into the Setit river, which begins in neighbouring Ethiopia, increasing pollution levels, the health official added.\nNear the local hospital, workers spray insecticide to fight the proliferation of flies, which Ali said was a symptom of poor sanitation.\nDam construction in 2015 on the Setit river had displaced \"entire villages\", he said, and their inhabitants \"dug makeshift latrines, which attract flies because they are not maintained\".\nAccess to clean water has been hampered across the country, in areas under either the army or the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, both vying for control of Sudan.\n- 'I will have no one' -\nThe paramilitaries have laid siege to entire areas, preventing the entry of fuel needed to pump clean water, while bureaucratic hurdles and fighting have blocked aid operations, putting key water stations out of service.\nThe war has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced more than 10 million and shuttered more than 70 percent of Sudan's healthcare facilities, according to the UN.\nThe rival forces have both been accused of war crimes, including targeting civilians and looting or obstructing humanitarian aid.\nWith Sudan facing what the UN has called \"one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent memory\" and aid groups unable to help, many feel they have to fend for themselves.\nSitting outside a hospital in Kassala, 49-year-old Hassan al-Junaid said he has been displaced by the war, and now \"we are living in very bad conditions, which caused my sister to get cholera.\"\n\"I am the only one with her, but I can't go with her inside because she has been placed in quarantine,\" he said.\n\"So I'm staying here, worried for her and afraid that I might be infected myself,\" added Junaid.\n\"If that happens, I will have no one to buy me the medicine I would need.\"", "40571": "title: Sudan updates: Floods frustrate flow of aid amid fears typhoid and cholera will spread \n content: Food trucks stuck as waterborne diseases pose threat to malnourished children and women\n19 August 2024, WFP Staff\nMore than 50 trucks carrying an estimated 4,800 metric tons of World Food Programme (WFP) food and nutrition assistance \u2013 enough for around 500,000 people \u2013 are stuck in various locations across Sudan, unable to move towards their final destinations due to flooded and impassable roads.\nThe rainy season is exacerbating the already devastating situation in Sudan, as floods force more people from their homes, increase humanitarian needs, and cut off communities from vital assistance. Heavy rains have destroyed key bridges and made it extremely difficult for aid convoys to pass through muddy, flooded roads.\nNearly 143,000 people in 12 of Sudan\u2019s 18 states have been affected by the floods and 50 people killed. At least 27,000 people have been displaced, according to OCHA. The extent of damage and number of people affected is likely being underreported as some of the worst flooding is in hard-to-reach conflict hotspots: Khartoum, Gezira, Kordofan and Darfur.\nWFP had planned to reach half a million people with assistance transported via the Tine border crossing this month but aid trucks are currently stranded on the Chad side, with heavy rainfall making it largely impassable \u2013 some trucks have been stuck for up to two weeksone month.\nThe spread of waterborne diseases, like cholera and typhoid, caused by flooding is a major concern. Such diseases can be lethal to malnourished children and women, who are already bearing much of the fallout from the devasting war.\nA record 3.6 million children and 1.2 pregnant or breastfeeding mothers are suffering levels of malnutrition never previously seen in Sudan.\nThese preventable diseases spread quickly in areas where critical infrastructure, like clean water and sanitation systems, has been damaged by conflict and in overcrowded displacement camps.\nAbove-average rainfall is forecast to last until September (typically the height of the rainy season). Some forecasts warn that flooding could surpass the historic 2020 floods that hit Khartoum.\nWFP has food in Sudan that we are ready to deliver to hungry people across the country. But active fighting continues to make it impossible to reach communities trapped in conflict hotspots at the scale needed to save lives and stop famine from spreading. A humanitarian ceasefire is urgently required to massively expand humanitarian access. Ultimately, an end to the conflict is the only sustainable solution. It is critical for the warring parties to leave the battlefield and show up at the negotiating table.\nSince late June, fighting has spread east across Sennar and Gedaref State and continues to intensify. This could sever key routes for humanitarian assistance from Port Sudan to other parts of Sudan, as well as hinder access to WFP\u2019s Kosti hub which is critical for aid deliveries across conflict lines to reach populations in White and Blue Nile states, the Greater Kordofan region, and parts of Darfur (South, East, North). These states include 11 famine risk areas.\nThere has also been an uptick of violence in Khartoum last week. In Khartoum, WFP has started using alternative ways of delivering assistance - via mobile money, cash vouchers, and support for community kitchens to provide hot meals - as it is difficult for trucks of WFP food aid to safely reach the capital. However, an urgent flow of in-kind food is still needed as food prices in Khartoum continue to spike and some community kitchens have closed because they can\u2019t get or afford supplies.\nWFP urgently needs all border crossings into Sudan to open. WFP needs to be able to use every possible supply route to deliver urgently needed food and nutrition assistance as shifting frontline lines and now severe flooding means we must constantly negotiate and secure new routes for aid convoys. This includes opening the border crossing from Adre (Chad) into West Darfur, which was announced last week, and a formal agreement between South Sudan and Sudan to transport aid from the south into Darfur, Kordofan, and Blue Nile.\nThe planned Geneva peace talks would offer a vital opportunity for the international community to address widespread operational challenges and access impediments directly with the warring parties obstructing aid delivery.", "43697": "title: Opinion| The Looming Constitutional Crisis in South Sudan and the Way Forward \n content: By Adv. Beny Gideon Mabor\nThe Republic of South Sudan is now at a difficult crossroads between holding general or partial elections or no elections at all in the country. As governments are established with specific mandatory periods, elections are the only such modus operandi for renewing or bringing on board a new government. If this is not done regularly or if there are any challenges associated with it, then we call it a constitutional crisis. Legally speaking, a constitutional crisis is a situation in which a major political dispute can not be clearly resolved on the basis of the particular country\u2019s constitution or established practice. This is where South Sudan is standing today.\nOn 5th July, 2024, the Chairperson of the National Elections Commission, Prof. Abednego Akok Kacuol exercised his constitutional obligations in discharge of legal processes governing general elections in the country and subsequently announced the election date in South Sudan to be 22nd December 2024.\nThis is in pursuance to the provision of section 16 (1) of the National Elections Acts 2012 as amended, which provides that \u201cwhenever an election is to be held, the commission shall determine and announce the date in accordance with the constitution and published it in the official gazette or two newspapers of nationwide circulation and on the commission website and mass media, a notice of the holding of election at least six (6) months before the date of elections\u201d. This has been done and considered running the electoral countdown.\nOn the same token, there\u2019s no holding of general elections with the government intact. Section 16 (2) of the National Elections Acts 2012 as amended provides that \u201cupon announcement of the date of elections by the commission, the President, shall within three months to the election date, dissolve the National Legislature, State Legislative Assemblies, the National Government, and State Governments, except the President, the First Vice President and four Vice Presidents are to remain in their positions in accordance with section 16 (4) of the National Elections Act 2012 as amended during the elections period until taking over of the next President.\nIt\u2019s against this background that three months to the election date will end on 22nd September 2024. This means that if there are going to be elections on the aforementioned date, then the partial legitimacy of the government will end on 22nd September 2024, which is precisely one month from today, 21st August 2024, and the President is by this legal obligation expected to dissolve the government at all levels on the same date, with the exception of the Presidency.\nOn the other hand, if there are no elections to be held as announced by the Chairperson of the National Elections Commission, which is interrupted by political decisions, then the political forces and other relevant stakeholders, considering the ongoing political processes, both at home and away need to urgently reconvene a new political dialogue now to come up with a new political order which will be the basis to extend the lifespan and the political and constitutional legitimacy of the government.\nAs many of you are aware or not, it\u2019s only section 57 (1) of the National Elections Act 2012 as amended that mandated the National Elections Commission to postpone elections if it becomes impossible to conduct the election by reason of proven occurrence of an imminent danger that threatens country or state for the case of the state Governor, or any part thereof, or in the event of a declaration of a state of emergency according to article 189 of the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan 2011 as amended throughout the country, state or any part thereof; provided that the commission shall fix a new date for elections as soon as possible, which shall not exceed sixty days from the original date established for such elections.\nTherefore, the postponement of elections, if any, is squarely a responsibility of the parties to the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in the Republic of South and other stakeholders and not the National Elections Commission. If the consensus is reached with viable political dispensation or order, then it shall be subsequently incorporated into the constitutional amendments and electoral governance calendar for the government to hold the general elections in the country.\nAdv.

This war seeks to reshape Sudan, its State, demography and potentially its map to further the agenda of an avaricious regional power, with the tacit approval or indifference of certain global actors. The international community is fully aware of the severe atrocities and violations of international humanitarian law perpetrated by the Militia against our people. I affirm that our armed forces (SAF) are fully capable of defeating the Militia. SAF is fighting this imposed war with unwavering determination to restore peace and stability, enabling our people to rebuild their lives and repair the national unity and social fabric that the war has gravely threatened.\nThis war would not have lasted this long without the logistical, political and media support the Militia receives from certain regional countries. We in Sudan, therefore, call upon all peace-loving nations, as well as international and regional organizations, to unequivocally condemn external interference in Sudan\u2019s internal affairs and demand these countries cease supporting the rebel militia with money, weapons, and mercenaries. We believe this is the shortest path to ending the war. We also appeal to all nations, particularly our sisterly and friendly countries, to condemn the crimes and atrocities committed by the Militia, along with its serious violations of international humanitarian law. The Militia\u2019s breach of the Jeddah Declaration on the protection of civilians and the delivery of relief warrants a decisive and deterrent international response.\nConversely, Sudan welcomes all serious initiatives aimed at restoring peace and stability. However, Sudan remains steadfast in its commitment to the Jeddah platform as the forum for negotiating a ceasefire. We insist on implementing the resolutions of the Jeddah platform, which include protecting civilians and allowing them to return to their homes as a prerequisite for reaching a final agreement on a ceasefire. The Jeddah Declaration remains the only binding and practical framework for addressing humanitarian issues and protecting civilians. It provides the most feasible basis for a ceasefire and lasting peace. Had it been implemented in good faith since its signing, just four weeks after the war began, it could have led to an early peaceful settlement. Any attempt to undermine or overlook it, will, therefore, derail the peaceful resolution of the crisis. Unfortunately, the lenient or empathetic attitude of several influential members of the international community toward the Militia\u2019s disregard for the Declaration and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 2736 (2024), only serves to advance the Militia\u2019s strategy of buying time and evading serious peace commitments.\nRegarding the humanitarian situation, Sudan is committed to protecting and delivering aid to those in need. However, I have to clarify that Sudan is not facing an imminent famine, despite the Militia\u2019s concerted and deliberate campaign to starve populations in certain regions of the country. The Militia\u2019s strategy involves preventing farming in key food-producing regions by stealing agricultural machinery, inputs and harvests, blocking irrigation canals, terrorizing farmers, obstructing relief deliveries and looting major food warehouses. Nevertheless, according to the latest joint survey conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and UN specialized agencies, there is only a minor deficit in staple grains in the country, a matter that occasionally happens due to different reasons, such as rain shortage.\nAs a contingency plan, we will cultivate sufficient quantities of sorghum, the main staple grain, in safe states, even those where it is not traditionally grown. For wheat, which is primarily consumed in urban centers, the country will continue to rely on imports. Portraying the humanitarian challenge as dependent on a particular border corridor is misleading. Currently, five border corridors are open for aid passage, in addition to seven international airports ready to receive aid flights. The recent statement by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) on the seizure of its trucks loaded with medicines and therapeutic food supplies by the Militia near El-Fasher, after crossing from Chad, highlights that the real problem lies in the Militia\u2019s premeditated plan to obstruct aid delivery, not in the use of a specific entry point. Moreover, Sudan calls on the international community and relief organizations to fulfil their pledges of humanitarian assistance. So far, only about 17% of these pledges have been realized. Finally, I would like to reaffirm our determination to achieve the goals of the glorious December 2019 Revolution, transitioning to democracy and forming a transitional government after the war. The foremost tasks of this government will be disbanding militias in favor of a unified national army and holding fair general elections, allowing the Sudanese people to choose their leaders and express their hopes and aspirations for a better future.", "46957": "title: A year into Sudan war.. shocking economic losses \n content: Khartoum: Altaghyeer\nOn 15 April, Sudan marked a year since plunging into a senseless war, as it was described even by both warring parties; the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\nThe ongoing war is having a devastating impacts on the country\u2019s economy according to local, regional and international statistics.\nSpecialists said the ongoing war in Sudan has resulted in the destruction of 65% of the agricultural sector, 75% of the industrial sector and 70% of the service sector while the Chamber of Commerce estimates the direct financial losses of its members at 5 billion dollar.\nOfficial estimates:\nThere are no official statistics on the total economic losses, but the Minister of Finance, Dr. Jibril Ibrahim had estimated, at the end of last year, that the country\u2019s economic losses might reach 200 billion dollar, not counting the lost economic opportunities for the country.\nEconomic contraction:\nThe International Monetary Fund expected the Sudanese economy to contract by 18.3% during the year 2023 and more than 3 million people would lose their jobs.\nThe World Bank said the war has caused a decline in the citizens purchasing power as the value of the national currency decreased while the commodity prices sharply increased.\nOil sector:\nThe losses in the oil sector are very large. Sudan lost about 210 thousand barrels of crude as a result of destruction of the crude warehouse at Al-Jaili refinery north of Khartoum.\nThe Sudanese Oil Minister, Mohieddin Naim Mohamed Saeed, estimated, in an interview with the Sudan News Agency (SUNA), the destruction inflicted on energy and oil sector at $5 billion.\nSudan produces about 60,000 barrels of oil per day, representing 40% of its needs.\nIndustrial losses:\nThe Ministry of Industry revealed that about 90% of factories in Khartoum State and some other states have been destroyed in the war.\nMore than 400 factories were nearly completely destroyed, according to the Chamber of Industry.\nCollapse:\nResearcher and economic analyst Dr. Alalah Abdel Razeq described, in an interview with Altaghyeer, what happened as a complete collapse and systematic destruction of large sectors of the infrastructure, noting that some estimates and reports issued by international organizations indicated that the costs of this war are more than 100 billion dollars.\nAlso, volume of the economic activity has dropped at a rate of 50-60% and the economy contracted by more than 18%; the worst ever in the history of the country, said Abdel Razeq.\nHe said because of the war the country\u2019s exports fell to an equivalent of only 10-12 million dollars per month. The country has also lost 6.4 billion dollars in development aid provided to Sudan by international and regional financing institutions, which was allocated for the development of some projects.\nThe Paris Club also suspended relief of the Sudan\u2019s debts and financial arrears.\nAbdel Razeq said the 2024 budget, which was allocated to war funding and security operations, has no room for production and social services, such as health and education, because it has already lost 80% of its revenues due to the war, thus living conditions will deteriorate further.\nAgricultural sector: Economic researcher Ahmed Ibn Omar told Altaghyeer that what happened in the agricultural sector is a massive deterioration. He gives an example of sorghum crop whose production was 3 million tons in previous seasons, but it dropped in 2023 by 43% compared to the previous year. Millet production in 2023 amounted to about 683,000 tons, which is 64% lower than the production of 2022. Wheat production was 377,000 tons, which is approximately 20% less than the previous year.\nGezira Scheme:\nIbn Omar warned of the impact of war on the largest agricultural project in the region. He said cultivated area in the Gezira Scheme was reduced to 50% this year, especially for peanut and sorghum crops. Also, major producers and traders left the scheme because there is no large markets for selling the crops.\nHe concluded that the agricultural sector is fragile and the impacts of war will hasten its collapse. It used to contribute 32.7% to the Sudan\u2019s GDP but its contribution dwindled now to half this percentage as Darfur, al-Gezira and Khartoum States no longer contribute to the agricultural production.\nIbn Omar said the cultivated areas in other parts of the country represent only 37% of the total land prepared for cultivation.\nBanking sector:\nThe banker Abu Ubaida Saeed said the banking sector has been tremendously affected by the war. The banks have been subjected to looting particularly its gold reserves. The same applies to the Sudan\u2019s Mint.\nSaeed points out that the value of the Sudanese pound has deteriorated by more than 150% since the outbreak of war in April 2023, a matter that led to the erosion of the Sudanese banks\u2019 capital and thus the loss of their ability to meet the needs of their customers for foreign exchange and financing. Almost 70% of bank branches have been closed.\nMost experts and specialists agreed that the effective solution for all these catastrophic war impacts on Sudan economy lies first in stopping the war and then starting the economic reform process.\nEnd", "49629": "title: With Sudan\u2019s media muzzled, famine ravages a nation in the dark \n content: With Sudan\u2019s media muzzled, famine ravages a nation in the dark\nOur country Sudan is enduring an unprecedented humanitarian tragedy, as evidenced by reports and statistics from international humanitarian agencies, testimonies from grassroots organisations and emergency rooms tirelessly supporting displaced people and those residing in areas grappling with food shortages.\nJoint editorial by the Sudan Media Forum*\nReports from international organisations reveal that nearly half of Sudan\u2019s population, approximately 18 million people, face the looming threat of famine, with five million already experiencing extreme levels of hunger. This crisis coincides with the second consecutive year of agricultural failure due to the devastating war, which has prevented the cultivation of essential food crops in key agricultural regions.\nThe dire situation is further exacerbated by the difficulty of delivering humanitarian aid to affected areas due to obstruction by both warring parties. They impede aid convoys, often resorting to confiscating and even diverting supplies for their own use. This year\u2019s unusually severe autumn rainy season has also disrupted major roads, destroyed bridges, and further hindered the delivery of crucial humanitarian assistance.\nNumerous international organisations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Office for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and others, are actively monitoring the situation in Sudan. Emergency rooms, charitable organisations, and local committees dedicated to supporting displaced people are working tirelessly on the ground to provide daily meals and medical care to those affected by the conflict, navigating exceptionally challenging and complex circumstances.\nThis vital humanitarian work faces numerous obstacles imposed by both warring parties in the areas under their control, beginning with administrative and bureaucratic hurdles. Humanitarian workers and volunteers also face threats ranging from arrests and prolonged investigations to restrictions on movement, systematic targeting, and confiscation of the desperately needed aid they bring to assist citizens impacted by the war.\nThe numerous restrictions imposed on civil society organisations and grassroots committees serving local communities have severely hampered their ability to gather information, assess the situation, and issue calls for assistance. Communication blackouts have further compounded these challenges by limiting communication capabilities and hindering access to funding via banking applications, which have become the sole means of transferring money.\nThe local and foreign media face a similar predicament, unable to adequately report on the humanitarian crisis affecting refugees and displaced people due to restrictions, communication disruptions, and internet outages. Journalists are not permitted to operate freely in covering these critical issues, often forced to work in secrecy, which is entirely incompatible with the nature of their work. They need to communicate with those directly affected, conduct on-site investigations, and obtain accurate statistics and data from responsible authorities.\nEven when foreign journalists and media personnel are granted access to the country, they remain under strict surveillance by both warring factions, preventing them from obtaining credible information. The national media is also marginalized, creating a vacuum filled with unreliable estimates, figures, and inaccurate reports.\nDespite these immense challenges, the free and independent national media, steadfast in its commitment to journalistic principles, perseveres in fulfilling its professional duty. Journalists in Sudan operate under perilous conditions, facing various violations, yet their unwavering resolve is encapsulated in their motto: \u201cWe work for the people and the country\u2026 whatever the cost.\u201d\nWe, of the Sudan Media Forum, remain dedicated to our mission of seeking and disseminating the truth. We will continue to uphold our professional duties and responsibilities with unwavering dedication, despite the risks and challenges faced by our colleagues reporting from conflict zones, displacement areas, and refugee camps within and beyond Sudan\u2019s borders. We are committed to shedding light on the dire reality, regardless of the obstacles.\nFurthermore, we at the Sudan Media Forum will continue to advocate for the empowerment of journalists from all Sudanese, regional, and international media outlets. They must be allowed to carry out their professional duties, including the right to access information and publish news reports and stories about the humanitarian situation and the famine threatening millions in Sudan. This right is enshrined in international humanitarian law and human rights law.\nBoth parties to the conflict must uphold their international obligations to ensure the safety and protection of journalists without delay or obstruction. We will persistently emphasise this imperative, recognising the critical importance of enabling the press and journalists to provide independent coverage of the armed conflict in Sudan and its devastating impact on the lives, security, and well-being of civilians, wherever they may be.\n#StandWithSudan\n* This report was produced as part of the #StandWithSudan campaign launched by the Sudan Media Forum in April this year, to draw attention to the humanitarian disaster, avert famine, and halt violence against civilians in Sudan.

UN News spoke with young people operating \u201cemergency response rooms\u201d in war-torn Sudan to find out how they are helping to overcome hunger at besieged famine-stricken camps in North Darfur, home to more than half a million displaced people, as the world commemorates World Humanitarian Day, marked annually on 19 August.\nThese young Sudanese volunteers work in youth-led initiatives born in the throes of the ongoing war that has displaced millions since fighting erupted in April 2023 between rival militaries, and they are providing lifesaving assistance with limited means and strong will, from food, water and medicine to helping the wounded and sheltering the homeless.\n\u201cThe emergency rooms are born from the womb of suffering and became a link between organizations and the needy on the ground,\u201d said Mubarak Mohamed Idris, a member of the youth-led initiative at the Zamzam camp.\nNow they are tackling famine, and their emergency rooms have been a lifeline for thousands of displaced, besieged people at a time when the UN is on the ground providing assistance as international aid organizations scramble for safe, unfettered access to reach those in need.\nHope in a landscape of suffering\nA landscape of suffering in this part of Sudan is unfolding in the wake of global food security experts announcing a famine in the Zamzam camp, with aid agencies now warning of similar conditions in the nearby Abu Shouk and Al-Salam camps.\nAid organizations have no access to these camps due to fighting and road blockages to deliver much-needed assistance, so the youth-led emergency room came forward to provide food for the hungry, Mr. Idris said.\nThe Zamzam camp hosts around 500,000 displaced people from Darfur\u2019s five states as well as displaced people who fled the conflict in Khartoum, which has dramatically increased the camp\u2019s population, according to aid agencies.\nThe camp has become a \u201cminiature Darfur\u201d, according to Mr. Idris, who said \u201cchildren spend their entire day without any food at all\u201d.\nCommunity kitchens fight famine\nSome families go by for many days without lighting a fire because they have no food to cook, he said, emphasising that \u201cthe camp is besieged, and families have nothing.\u201d\nSo, they created a community kitchen, where volunteers prepare and provide food, around the clock, to more than 46 shelters inside the camp.\n\u201cThis helps us alleviate the suffering of the displaced inside the camp due to the lack of food and the inability of families to feed themselves,\u201d he said.\nSpirit of solidarity and cooperation\nThe role of emergency rooms goes far beyond material assistance. Young volunteers are promoting solidarity among the displaced, providing shelter and clothing, evacuating the injured from conflict areas and helping those hit by such disasters as flooding.\nAccess to safe water is another enormous challenge, as all the wells at the Zamzam camp were out of service due to the lack of fuel because the area is surrounded by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which continues to battle against the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF).\n\u201cNow, only two of the eight water wells in the camp are operating,\u201d Mr. Idris said. \u201cWe struggle to bring water to the camp in light of the clashes and artillery shelling and lack of funding. We bring two water carts with 200 barrels of water and distribute them to people in 46 centres, but that\u2019s not enough.\u201d\nThey are also working to provide tarpaulins and shelter supplies during the autumn period in addition to insecticide spraying tools and mosquito nets, and in the winter, they will provide clothing for children.\nModel of resilience amid starvation\nAbout 22 kilometres away, the same situation grimly unfolds at the Abu Shouk camp, said Mohamed Adam Abdel Latif, a representative of the media committee of the emergency room serving the community.\n\u201cAll signs of famine are very clear\u201d inside the camp, Mr. Latif said, noting that there have been \u201ca lot of deaths\u201d due to hunger among camp residents, especially among children.\nRecent floods destroyed more than 700 homes in the camp, and young volunteers face the same challenges, offer the same services and even expand their work to include rehabilitating affected shelters, providing everything from sanitary pads for women and girls to working in environmental sanitation.\nForced to eat animal feed\nMultiple challenges persist, from shortages of food and other lifesaving supplies. Most health centres were shuttered following artillery shelling, and the only one that provides primary suffers from a severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies, especially for children under age five.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have access to therapeutic nutrition,\u201d he stressed. \u201cWe have two therapeutic feeding centres, and they were bombed by the RSF.\u201d\nMeanwhile, rising food prices, forcing many people to eat animal feed, if available, as others become desperate, resorting to begging or prostitution so they can feed their children.\n\u201cWe provide food to shelters that are now completely dependent on us,\u201d Mr. Latif said, expressing gratitude for support received from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the Norwegian Refugee Council \u2013 a UN partner \u2013 which sent $5,000 to stock the community kitchen.\nHowever, a lack of steady support had recently forced the camp kitchen to shut down for 20 days.\nConditions could worsen\nRight now, all roads leading to the camp are currently closed while there are no basic medical supplies such as bandages and sterilisers available to help the large number of people with injuries, Mr. Latif said.\n\u201cWe have appealed many times, and we continue to appeal to international and UN organizations to provide services to us in any way,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe appeal to the UN authorities to coordinate with the bodies inside the camp in order to deliver support to displaced children and their families.\u201d", "50711": "title: Women human rights defenders bearing the brunt in Sudan \n content: Since war erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces SAF and the Rapid Support Forces RSF more than 16 months ago, women human rights defenders in Sudan are bearing the brunt. The El Alag Centre for Press Services, member of the Sudan Media Campaign, spoke with several women lawyers who fled their home or shelter in El Gezira.\nSince the outbreak of war between the Sudanese army and the RSF in Khartoum on April 15 last year, and the rapid spread of the fighting to Darfur, Kordofan, and central Sudan, more than 10 million people, most of them women and children, fled their homes in search of safe havens inside and outside Sudan to escape the killings and rapes.\nAt the forefront of these women were human rights defenders and other legal activists, the El Alag Centre wrote last week*.\n\u201cThey bear the burden for two reasons: they are women, and they are defenders of the rights of others, especially women\u2019s rights,\u201d El Alag states. \u201cThey were monitoring the increasing number of women rights violations, including gender-based violence, and supporting victims who were raped, forced into marriage and labour in the areas seized by the RSF.\u201d\nBut also in the so-called safe areas, controlled by the SAF, human rights defenders are not safe. Both warring parties accuse them of being \u201cmercenaries\u201d, suspecting them of \u201cspying for the enemy\u201d.\nEl Gezira, south of Khartoum, was occupied by the RSF in December last year, except for El Managil in the northwest of the state. As part of an evaluation study in the El Alag Centre spoke with four women lawyers from El Gezira and one who fled Khartoum about their personal experiences. As most of them are still in Sudan, they are referred to by their initials, for security reasons.\n\u201cWhen the RSF were beleaguering El Gezira state and agents of the General Intelligence Service (GIS) and Military Intelligence increased their persecution and detention of human rights activists and their relatives, my family and I also received threats that forced us to leave. I thus lost my source of livelihood as a lawyer,\u201d S.M. reported.\nH.R. confirms her report: \u201cBeing in areas of ongoing clashes with no protection for lawyers and journalists, both men and women, the possibility of facing accusations by one party of spying for the other party, confiscation of telephones by security agents of the belligerents, the lack of security when using social media and being exposed to the hacks, all of this made me live with severe tension and constant fear for myself and my siblings, which prompted me to flee.\u201d\nAnother human rights defender with the initials S.M. told El Alag that \u201cAfter we used to extend a helping hand to the many people who fled Khartoum state, we ourselves became displaced following the attack on Wad Madani [the capital of El Gezira].\n\u201cMy family and I fled the city, carrying only a few clothes with us. We found refuge in the home of our relatives in countryside nearby. We lived there with 41 people in one house for four days, when gunmen entered the area. They stormed the houses, fired at us, and robbed us of our belongings.\n\u201cWe then moved to another safe area, walking, as there was no transportation available at all. The roads were crowded with people fleeing the violence. We thought that we reached a safe place, but we were attacked by gunmen again, and fled to El Managil, a journey that took 12 hours on foot.\u201d\nSh.N. fled Sudan. \u201cI feel depressed as I was forced to leave the house in El Gezira due to the violence. Because my sick mother needs medical care, we left the country \u2013 something I would never think I would do. Despite the difficulties of living in Sudan throughout the past years, we refused any opportunity to leave Sudan in order to serve our country and our people. Frankly, these questions and the feeling that there is a party that cares about our situation brought back the spirit of work to me again.\u201d\nFor L.S. her and her family\u2019s movement became restricted after the RSF occupied the area. \u201cEven leaving the house became impossible because we were threatened. Three armed men stormed the house. They pointed their weapons at my nephew\u2019s head, and they stole everything we owned. We able to hide our phones. They also tried to take my niece with them, fortunately they did not succeed,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo far, we did not report about what we were exposed to until we\u2019ll find a way to get out of this place. It is also very difficult to communicate with the people and human rights groups we used to work with.\u201d\nKh. A. fled twice, first from Khartoum, and the second time from Wad Madani where she and her relatives had taken refuge. \u201cThe experience in El Gezira was more severe. We were preparing to have tea in the morning when we heard the sound of cannons and bullets. This caused great fear among the displaced people in the shelter complex in the city, which included about 7,000 families in three large dormitories. So, you can imagine the stampede to get out of the complex.\n\u201cWe all crossed the Hantoub bridge on foot, including the children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled, in search of transportation towards Sennar or Singa. I lost my mother for a while. We kept sleeping and waking up to the sounds of war. Stray bullets were hitting the people.\n\u201cIt was worse than what we witnessed in Khartoum.

The El Alag Centre for Press Services, member of the Sudan Media Campaign, spoke with several women lawyers who fled their home or shelter in El Gezira.\nSince the outbreak of war between the Sudanese army and the RSF in Khartoum on April 15 last year, and the rapid spread of the fighting to Darfur, Kordofan, and central Sudan, more than 10 million people, most of them women and children, fled their homes in search of safe havens inside and outside Sudan to escape the killings and rapes.\nAt the forefront of these women were human rights defenders and other legal activists, the El Alag Centre wrote last week*.\n\"They bear the burden for two reasons: they are women, and they are defenders of the rights of others, especially women's rights,\" El Alag states. \"They were monitoring the increasing number of women rights violations, including gender-based violence, and supporting victims who were raped, forced into marriage and labour in the areas seized by the RSF.\"\nBut also in the so-called safe areas, controlled by the SAF, human rights defenders are not safe.

We found refuge in the home of our relatives in countryside nearby. We lived there with 41 people in one house for four days, when gunmen entered the area.

They dare not be apart from their families in case somebody is killed in a strike and they're not together. Colleagues tell me that they would rather die together than die separately.\u201d\nFacing constant danger and destruction\n\u201cWe often wake up to new challenges. Even in Khan Younis. You know, we have just rehabilitated a water well - this is an achievement of the war. [Providing] water to 100,000 people in the Khan Yunis area, amongst all the rubble, amongst all the displacement. And now there are tanks in this area and people are fleeing\u2026It is so challenging to deliver humanitarian response with these forced displacements, with the ongoing bombing and strikes being able to navigate the area safely. It's just impossible to be safe in the Gaza Strip.\u201d\nRepeated blows\n\u201cIf we wake up tomorrow and the well in Khan Younis that is the biggest source of water for the population there has been destroyed again, of course, that's going to come with huge frustration and huge upset to the humanitarian response, to the community here. But I know staff will pick themselves up, they will carry on and they will repair it again, because what else will they do? They're not going to give up. They're going to keep doing everything they possibly can until we reach a ceasefire. Until there is some respite for the population - they will continue to serve their community.\u201d\nSudan: Leni Kinzli, the UN World Food Programme (WFP):\n\u2018This is what I signed up for\u2019\n\u201cSo. I've been an aid worker now for six years and being an aid worker in Sudan means basically never giving up. It's an incredibly difficult situation to be working in, especially for our Sudanese colleagues, and it just means never giving up and never giving up the belief and the hope that you are making a difference in people's lives - that the assistance that we're getting through does save lives and supports people in the very darkest of times as we're seeing in Sudan.\nThis is what I signed up for. This is what we all sign up for as aid workers there is, you know, no assumption when it comes to this, you dedicate your life in the service of others.\u201d\nUnforgettable testimony\n\u201cOne recent example that has brought home for me what it means to be a humanitarian is a recent encounter I had in Port Sudan with a woman who is in about mid-30s, had escaped and was living in Port Sudan, basically after an 800-kilometre trek to safety. And she was telling me the details of everything that she went through in the war. She really got extremely emotional about it.\nBut then she also mentioned how receiving assistance from WFP monthly emergency food ration packages helped her to make that journey and then arrive in a place where she was safe and could share her story with me and also let out some of the trauma that she experienced.\nShe was in my arms crying, But letting that out and having the space to allow people to share the difficulties that they've been through and giving them the empathy and compassion they deserve after such horrific experiences; that's what being a humanitarian is all about.\u201d\nThe reality of delivering relief\n\u201cWhat humanitarian workers across Sudan, especially Sudanese aid workers, are up against, is the most complex operating environment in the world today. So what that means is, in the areas where people need help the most there is active fighting, there are airstrikes, bombings, shellings in places like Khartoum, the capital (and) the capital of North Darfur.\nBut then along the roads where we would have to transport food, there are so many checkpoints, so many different actors, armed actors involved across different lines of conflict, so it is a constant negotiation and constant communication with those parties.\u201d\nUkraine: Emanuele Bruni UN World Health Organization (WHO):\nLethal \u2018double tap\u2019 threat in Odessa\n\u201cSeven months ago after an initial attack, one emergency medical system worker was running quickly to the spot where the attack occurred, not caring (about) the siren, not caring of the warnings - it's the spirit of the workers and of the health workers. The unfortunate story which really breaks my heart is that this health worker, this young emergency medical system worker, was hit by the second tap.\n[They were] hit by doing this work for the people, and this is something I will never forget\u2026The attack on the children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv is definitely the most evident of the attacks. But these attacks to emergency medical workers happen every day. I will never forget.\u201d\nHealthcare targeted\n\u201cSince the beginning of 2024, we have observed a lot of \u201cdouble tap\u201d hits; basically [there\u2019s data] that health workers are three times more prone to be attacked. This is absolutely hampering the response and also the healthcare status of the population as well as of the health system.

Many of these families are being displaced for the second and third time, having sought refuge in Sinja in Sennar state after fleeing Khartoum and Gazira states earlier in the conflict.\nSave the Children child protection teams in Blue Nile and Gedaref states have recorded at least 451 children between June 29 and August 14 forced to make the perilous journey to safety without their parents, the highest number they have recorded in such a short period since the conflict started in April 2023.\nAt least 60,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) who have made their way to Blue Nile state have been settled in more than 109 gathering sites and schools, which could delay reopening of schools in September.\nFurther, ongoing heavy rains and floodings are compounding the suffering for families and children fleeing fighting, with muddy and impassable roads making it difficult to get essential supplies, including food and medicine to people who need them.\nThe interior ministry this month reported heavy rainfall across different parts of the country killing at least 68 people, increasing the suffering for millions of people struggling to survive in the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis. The heavy rains have also led to a scarcity of essential drugs and goods such as wheat flour, oil, cereals and onions. in the local markets, driving up prices.\nMore than 16 months of conflict have killed and injured thousands of children, forced many into child labour, destroyed healthcare and education, upended food systems, and created the world\u2019s worst child displacement crisis with 6.7 million children now forced from their homes [4].\nMary Lupul, Humanitarian Director of Save the Children in Sudan, said:\n\u201cOur staff in Blue Nile and Gedaref states are receiving at least nine children without their parents in camps for displaced people every day. During my visit to an IDP camp in Gedaref last month I saw children who had endured terrifying journeys arrive at our reception centres, completely exhausted and many showing signs of malnutrition.\n\u201cThese children have seen their homes, hospitals, playgrounds and schools bombed, looted and occupied, and have been separated from their parents or guardians. They\u2019ve lost loved ones and been subject to unspeakable violence. We know that children who have been separated from families are at much higher risk of violence, abuse and exploitation, including trafficking, recruitment into armed groups and sexual and gender-based violence.\n\u201cIn Gedaref, Save the Children has put up a child friendly space where children can play and be children again. They are sheltered from the fighting happening outside this place and receive lots of psychosocial support from our staff. Here, they have a chance to express their emotions through drawing, find comfort in other children and even enjoy a game of volleyball.\n\u201cWhat I personally witnessed is that children even in the most dire and trying of circumstances want to be children and the opportunity to play and be with other children is so important. Yet this crisis is not getting the attention it deserves. Save the Children is calling for an immediate ceasefire and meaningful progress towards a lasting peace agreement as well as for the international community to step up and release the necessary funding and resources to protect children\u2019s lives.\u201d\nThe humanitarian response for Sudan is significantly underfunded, with donors contributing just 37.4% to a $2.7 billion UN response plan.\nIn early August, Save the Children warned that the number of children in Sudan seeking treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) has surged to unprecedented levels. Data from the aid agency showing a rapid spike in malnutrition in the central southern state of South Kordofan where the number of under-fives admitted with SAM in June in alone was 99% of the programme\u2019s expected case load for the year [1].\nAt the same time, the Famine Review Committee of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) \u2013 the leading international authority on the severity of hunger crises \u2013 said there was famine in North Darfur\u2019s Zamzam Camp due to the escalating humanitarian crisis which threatens to spill over into the rest of Sudan.\nSave the Children, in partnership with Ministry of Social Development, State Council for Child Welfare and Family and Child Protection Unit, is supporting unaccompanied and separated children with an interim care package that includes basic items such as rice, lentils, sugar, cooking oil, soap, blankets and mosquito nets in Damazine, Blue Nile state.\nSave the Children has worked in Sudan since 1983 and is currently supporting children and their families across Sudan providing health, nutrition, education, child protection and food security and livelihoods support. Save the Children is also supporting refugees from Sudan in Egypt and South Sudan.\nENDS\n[1] https://dtm.iom.int/reports/dtm-sudan-flash-alert-overview-june-july-2024?close=true\nSubsequent IOM flash updates report that further displacement has occurred in Sennar state in August.

spread in Sudan, says World Food Program \n content: 500 days of war: More global attention must to prevent famine spread in Sudan, says World Food Program\n\u2018We have received reports of people eating leaves off of trees or grass, resorting to very dire coping mechanisms,\u2019 says Kinzli\n- \u2018We need an immediate cessation of hostilities ... to prevent famine from spreading to other places across the country,\u2019 says Kinzli\n- \u2018The world needs to be paying more attention \u2026 international community really needs to step up more for the Sudanese people,\u2019 says WFP official\nISTANBUL\nAs the war in Sudan nears the grim mark of 500 days, one area in the country is experiencing the \u201cfirst famine confirmed worldwide since 2017\u201d and 13 more regions are at imminent risk of famine, an official of the UN\u2019s food agency told Anadolu.\nThe only way to prevent famine from spreading is for the international community to be \u201cpaying more attention to Sudan,\u201d said Leni Kinzli, head of communications and spokesperson for World Food Program (WFP) Sudan.\nFamine has been confirmed in the Zamzam camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in North Darfur, which was the \u201cfirst confirmation of famine worldwide since 2017,\u201d she said.\nThere are over 25.6 million people in Sudan facing acute hunger and another 8.5 million in emergency levels of hunger, she added.\n\u201cWe need an immediate cessation of hostilities so that we can flood aid into the country to \u2026 prevent famine from spreading to other places across the country,\u201d Kinzli told Anadolu.\nRegarding the confirmed case of famine, she said people in Zamzam camp were first displaced decades ago due to the Darfur crisis.\n\u201cEven before this current war that started 16 months ago, it was a very needy population that was living there, dependent on food assistance,\u201d she said.\nThis is also the first famine confirmation in Sudan in the history of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), she said, referring to the globally recognized assessment and analysis process set up in 2004 to identify food security risks around the world.\nAmong the 13 areas at risk of famine are some, like two localities in Al-Jazirah state, that \u201chad no issues with food insecurity before the conflict,\u201d said Kinzli.\nThe current situation has deteriorated to the point where \u201cwe have received reports of people eating leaves off of trees or grass,\u201d said the WFP official.\nPeople are \u201cresorting to very dire coping mechanisms to try to have any kind of sustenance to make it to the next day,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThese are really people who are struggling day by day to survive.\u201d\nReasons for \u2018the largest hunger crisis in the world\u2019\nKinzli said food insecurity in Sudan has been growing worse year by year since 2019.\n\u201cBefore the conflict broke out 16 months ago, we were already seeing each year, higher and higher levels of hunger, record levels of hunger,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNow for the last 16 months, the war has just further exacerbated this situation, leading to the largest hunger crisis in the world.\u201d\nOne in every two Sudanese people are struggling to put food on their plate, she added.\nSome of the main drivers of the harrowing situation are a \u201cmacroeconomic crisis\u201d and \u201cinter-communal violence,\u201d according to the official.\nOther factors are the repeated \u201cconflict displacement,\u201d along with climate disasters such as droughts and floods, which have led to below average agricultural production, she said.\nLast year\u2019s average nationwide harvest for staple cereal crops like sorghum, millet and wheat was 41% below the five-year average, while food production has significantly plunged over the past six months, Kinzli explained.\nCiting examples, she said large swaths of agricultural land have now become battlefields, like in Al-Jazirah and other states in eastern Sudan that \u201cwere previously the country\u2019s breadbasket.\u201d\nFarmers are \u201cnot able to access their lands because of insecurity\u201d and also find it increasingly difficult \u201cto plant in these areas because the inputs such as fertilizers, seeds have become so expensive,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe conflict is further exacerbating the already pre-existing macroeconomic crisis \u2026 Supply chains are completely disrupted. Critical infrastructure has been destroyed across the country, including critical factories to produce key food items such as wheat flour,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cSudan is a nation in ruins at this point. This all led to this absolutely catastrophic hunger situation.\u201d\nBleak future scenarios\nThe longer the war continues, the worse the situation is going to get \u201cbecause of the impact it is having on the entire agricultural system, food production, inflation and the economic crisis,\u201d said Kinizli, stressing the urgency for a halt to hostilities.\n\u201cAt some point, people are not going to be able to afford food anymore,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe longer the war continues \u2026 the more people will slip into higher and deeper levels of hunger, and unfortunately, the more hunger-related deaths that could happen.\u201d\nShe said the WFP has received reports of hunger-related deaths in certain locations, but there is no overall total figure so far.\n\u201cThis very much would actually be up to the government and local governments to report these \u2026 As you can imagine the connectivity in Sudan is also completely broken down,\u201d she said.\nSudan is currently in its \u201clean season, which is where food is typically less available,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also the peak hunger season because it\u2019s the season between harvests. It ends usually by the end of September or October, then we should see a slight improvement in food insecurity,\u201d said the WFP official.\n\u201cBut is what is concerning is what will happen in next year\u2019s lean season between May and September if the war continues, if crop production continues to be below average.\u201d\nWorld \u2018really needs to step up more\u2019\nKinzli also spoke about the challenges being faced by the WFP on the ground, stressing that \u201cgetting aid into Sudan has been extremely difficult.\u201d\n\u201cIt is one of the most complex operating environments in the world today, with immense constraints when it comes to humanitarian access,\u201d she said.\nThis, she added, is because of the active fighting, insecurity and lawlessness, as well as bureaucratic impediments and lengthy clearance processes.\n\u201cAlso the fact that not all border crossings are open for us to bring assistance in, and that both warring parties \u2026 are interfering with the delivery of assistance and not necessarily facilitating unfettered access for humanitarian agencies,\u201d said Kinzli.\nShe called out the international community for allowing Sudan to \u201cbecome somewhat of an ignored crisis.\u201d\n\u201cBy and large, the world needs to be paying more attention to Sudan \u2026 There needs to be an increase in diplomatic efforts \u2026 and we also need a massive increase in funding because the needs in Sudan just continue to increase and are further exacerbated every single day that the war goes on,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe international community really needs to step up more for the Sudanese people.\u201dAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

It taught me something valuable: that it is very normal for Sudanese people to host, feed, and support others; that solidarity is a central part of our cultural heritage.\nMany years later, my country is at war and I am now a host. From a humble house in the eastern town of Kassala, I am supporting 12 displaced people, all of them family members uprooted by the fighting that has spread through my country.\nI am not alone in doing this. Roughly half of the nearly eight million Sudanese internally displaced by the conflict are being accommodated by friends, family, or strangers. We are the frontline responders to the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis.\nI am happy to be a host and have my relatives close to me, though I must admit that it is not an easy job. Hosting is having a big impact on my life because all of my salary now goes to providing everyone around me with food and other basic needs.\nI also do not have privacy anymore in my own house, nor much time to myself to think and reflect. In Sudan, when you host people, you are expected to spend time and chat with them. Otherwise, it shows disrespect.\nAlthough we are currently safe in Kassala, we are also having to plan what we would do if the security situation deteriorates, as it has in other nearby states. It is possible that today\u2019s host families will become tomorrow\u2019s guests.\nI hope that sharing my story will help raise awareness about the role that hosts are playing in the humanitarian response here, because right now neither hosts nor our guests are receiving much support from humanitarian agencies.\nWith their limited resources, aid groups are instead mostly focusing on the displaced people living in public shelters and other official sites, though even they receive little support and speak of hunger, a lack of water, and inadequate shelter.\nI also hope that sharing my story will help people understand the suffering that Sudanese people are experiencing. Before, we were productive and self-sufficient with jobs and businesses. Now, we are forced to depend on the support of others.\nFrom Darfur to Kassala\nThough I am hosting displaced people, I have also been uprooted by this conflict, which started in April 2023 and pits the Sudanese army against the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group.\nThe war has produced the world's biggest hunger crisis as well as the largest displacement crisis \u2013 forcing more than 10 million people from their homes, including two million who have escaped to neighbouring countries.\nBefore the conflict, I was living in my hometown of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state (one of five states that make up the western Darfur region) with my husband and five children. I worked at the Nyala office of Mercy Corps, the American NGO.\nThe situation became untenable, however, because our residential area was trapped on the front line. We would see heavy weapons from our windows and hear constant shooting.\nAll we could do was hide inside the house and under our beds. One day, explosive debris killed my neighbour's daughter and blew a hole in our living room door while we were sitting in the space.\nIn November, we made the decision to leave Darfur for Kassala. We could not get a bus, so we did most of the journey on the back of a truck, stacked on top of piles of animal feed, wood, and luggage.\nThere were maybe 100 others in the truck, which took 10 days to reach Kassala. The journey was crowded and uncomfortable, and the road was tough, especially during a four-day desert crossing. Most of my family got sick along the way.\nSince I have settled in Kassala, more relatives displaced from Darfur have been arriving here to stay with me. We currently have 19 people in my house, including my immediate family.\nAmong the guests are my husband\u2019s mother, who is over 90, diabetic, and suffering from high blood pressure, and my husband\u2019s sister, who we think might have cancer. We weren\u2019t able to test her until recently due to the lack of health services.\nBoth of them came from Darfur, and it took them 19 days to reach Kassala. Can you imagine having such disabilities and having to uproot your life and take a journey of this kind?\nThe challenges of hosting\nIn order to host everyone, we had to build an extra room outside our house and buy furniture and appliances. My husband\u2019s colleague lent us four beds and kitchen utensils for a month when we arrived, and we are trying to secure more when we next get our salaries.\nWe share the space as best we can, but the house is cramped. We have only two toilets and seven people are currently sleeping in my bedroom \u2013 three of them on beds and four on plastic mats.\nWe have to pay for almost everything \u2013 water, food, and medical treatment \u2013 even as market prices are increasing every day.\nSome of our guests are trying to help. My sister\u2019s husband who is in El Fasher (the capital of North Darfur state) occasionally sends money, which they use for school fees and other personal needs. Yet while our guests are eager to work, they have faced challenges finding employment.\nWe have to pay for almost everything \u2013 water, food, and medical treatment \u2013 even as market prices are increasing every day. We are struggling to buy vegetables, and even bread is now more than double what it was three months ago.\nI definitely cannot meet all of my guests\u2019 needs. Some are sleeping on mats and on a veranda, and more care and attention is required for the elderly and for my sick sister-in-law who is vomiting everything that she eats.\nI am not able to give my children as much food as before because we need to share everything. I also have to add water to milk just so all the children I am hosting can get some. Five children are, meanwhile, in school \u2013 and that has costs too.\nThe expenses are digging into my savings. For years, I put aside money to buy a car and complete the construction of our Nyala home \u2013 which armed men have been using and looting since we left \u2013 but I spent it all to get furniture and appliances in Kassala.\nThe only money I have set aside is in case the war expands to Kassala and we have to leave the city for somewhere else \u2013 something that has happened to displaced people and host families in many areas.\nI am trying to manage all of these challenges while working a full-time job with Mercy Corps, now as the team leader of their Kassala office. I don\u2019t know if I am doing it well, but I know that I am trying.\nI also remind myself that while it is crowded in my house, others face worse conditions. Some neighbours are hosting over 20 people, and other displaced are in public buildings like schools, where there can be 10 families in a single classroom.\nWhat we experienced in Nyala\nWhile acting as a host I have also had my own things to process, not least the memory of what happened while we were still living in Darfur. You cannot imagine how hard it has been living through this conflict. It has taken so much from us.\nIn Nyala, we saw people dying on the streets with nobody to take away the bodies or even cover them up. One of my brothers, who is called Omay, got hit by a stray bullet in his back, and my brothers had shops that got looted and damaged.\nI did my best to help others during these difficult days. Neighbours would come to take refuge in our house due to our concrete roof, and would stay there until they felt safe. I would feed them and provide them with what they needed.\nYet, by September, things were worsening. Three times within two days, armed men tried to enter our house and use it as a hiding spot because of our solid roof. It terrified my children and others living with me.\nOn one occasion, the armed man knocked on our doors and, when I didn't open, they jumped over the compound wall. A second time, they started breaking our locks, so I went over to them and said many families with children were living inside the house.\nFrom that moment, I decided to leave Nyala with my extended family and travel to El Fasher. We left on a Friday but fighting erupted in El Fasher on the Saturday, and things soon became even worse for us.\nMy youngest sibling, Maaz, was kidnapped for three days from our residence in El Fasher while the rest of us were out. Then, a month later, my uncle and another brother, Mawia, were taken from my uncle\u2019s house by men who also tried to loot their vehicle.\nWhy work is keeping me going\nRight now, I am thinking deeply about how to support my brothers who were kidnapped. I want to find a safe place for them so they can have a better life and manage their trauma.\nI am also trying to figure out how I can process my own trauma. However, for now, I have found that if I sit in my house and start reflecting on recent events too much, then things become difficult for me.\nPeople also frequently ask us why Sudanese people are not getting support like other crises around the world do. I honestly don\u2019t know what to tell them.\nIn many ways, work is keeping me going. It helps me support my family and it gives me something to focus my energies on. Even when I feel sick, I still go to the office because this job is so important to me.\nStill, while I love humanitarian work, it can be difficult to see people who are hungry and sick and not be able to help them. Sometimes, the people we support through our work don\u2019t realise that we aid workers have also been affected by this conflict.\nPeople also frequently ask us why Sudanese people are not getting support like other crises around the world do. I honestly don\u2019t know what to tell them.\nI would like to start thinking about the future but it is clear that we cannot do that until we find a solution to end this conflict. All we can think about now is finding a safe place to meet our most basic needs, and the needs of those who we are supporting.\nEdited by Philip Kleinfeld.", "61739": "title: IOM CHAD : SUDAN CRISIS RESPONSE UPDATE NO. 40 | 22 AUGUST 2024 \n content: 138,665 registered returnees1 1 - For the complete dataset please check the DTM WEBSITE\n\n24,654 biometric registrations\n\n53% are female 2,287 are pregnants\n\n66% are children 7,674 are breastfeeding\n\nESTIMATED NUMBER OF RETURNEES (individuals)3\n\n44,710\n\n48,180\n\n80,986 67,780 60,830\n\n98,767\n\n131,425\n\nJuin Juillet Aout Septembre Octobre Novembre D\u00e9cembre 3 - IOM projections and estimates on returnees are evaluated every six months.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n139,932 Janvier\n\nIOM CHAD : SUDAN CRISIS RESPONSE UPDATE NO. 40 | 22 AUGUST 2024\n\nidentified at the Adr\u00e9 4,136 border crossing since 27 july 2024\n\n213,339 returnees in Chad (estimation)\n\n240,000 returnees projected to reach Chad by december 2024 (estimation)\n\n177,459 165,499 144,015\n\n53 locations2 with returnees identified across 3 provinces\n\n2 - IOM has registered returnees in 85% (45) of these locations\n\n213,339 201,379 189,419\n\nF\u00e9vrier\n\nMars Avril Mai Juin BACKGROUND\n\nJuillet\n\nWadi Fira\n\nGu\u00e9r\u00e9da\n\nSites with greatest number of registered returnees per province\n\nOuadda\u00ef Lyc\u00e9e d\u2019Adr\u00e9\n\nToumtouma 9,926 Adr\u00e9 * 42,539 22,849\n\nSila\n\nTongori 12,651 SUDAN 7,036 ** Goz Achiy\u00e9 5,372 Deguessa 35,847 17,618 ** 70 Km 0 \u00b1 * inclusive of Lyc\u00e9e d\u2019Adr\u00e9.

IOM expects this number to rise to 240,000 through to December 2024. This is due to ongoing conflict and food insecurity in Darfur, owing to the current suspension of the humanitarian corridor between Chad and Darfur.\n\nReturnees are Chadian nationals who were living in Sudan and have been displaced back to their home country where they lack the resources to rebuild their lives. Returnees are living either in displacement sites or within host communities. They are in urgent need of food, water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter, household items, health, and protection.

IOM continues to support and coordinate the delivery of WASH, food, protection, health, shelter, NFI, and education assistance in returnee sites by national and international partners including UNICEF, UNFPA, WFP, Concern Worldwide, INTERSOS, COOPI, ACTED, Help Tchad, and the Chadian Red Cross. \u2022 As the rainy season has brought about torrential rains and floods in Sila province, IOM is coordinating with local authorities to distribute vital NFI assistance to affected households. \u2022 IOM is preparing to support WFP in the new round of cash for food distributions to all registered returnees in Ouadda\u00ef and Sila provinces so as to meet their urgent needs.\n\nDISPLACEMENT DATA & KNOWLEDGE SHARING IOM\u2019s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) is a leading tool to monitor and analyse displacement flows. IOM DTM teams, including CNARR agents, locally recruited and trained enumerators, are deployed across Sila and Ouadda\u00ef provinces on an ongoing basis to identify and register vulnerable returnee households, including newly arrived households as well as households in remote locations, not previously identified. IOM\u2019s data on displacement and needs feeds knowledge sharing within the humanitarian community to coordinate and target lifesaving assistance to those in need. Biometric registration has been recently completed in Deguessa (Sila), in order to update and better identify the returnees currently living in the area.\n\nIOM continues to identify returnee households at the border crossing of Adr\u00e9. Over the past two weeks, IOM has identified 234 households (1,336 individuals), 94% of which were headed by a woman. The households were primarily coming from Al Geneina (67%) and Al Fasher (24%). They fled Sudan primarily due to insecurity \u2013 either conflict or preventive movement (65%) and intercommunal conflict (15%). IOM registered 154 households (1,148 individuals) via its registration centre at Lyc\u00e9e d\u2019Adr\u00e9 site, including households identified at the border and households referred to IOM by UNHCR..\n\nPROTECTION, MHPSS, AND SOCIAL COHESION\n\nIOM provides holistic, individualand community-level assistance in protection, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to the two main returnee communities of Tongori (Ouadda\u00ef) and Deguessa(Sila). IOM also strives to foster dialogue and peaceful coexistence between returnees and host communities through a range of social cohesion and conflict resolution activities. \u2022 IOM provided life-saving individual protection assistance to 91 persons. The assistance is tailored to each specific case and included urgent NFI support to households whose shelter had been flooded as well as punctual cash assistance to disabled or elderly beneficiaries who were support them in meeting their essential needs. \u2022 IOM conducted MHPSS activities to 725 individuals, including individual and group counselling, recreational activities, art therapy, and life skills support.\n---\nCHAD | SUDAN RESPONSE UPDATE No. 40\n\nARRIVALS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS\n\n234 1,336 households individuals\n\nIOM and CNARR monitor daily arrivals of returnees from Sudan passing through the Adr\u00e9 border crossing to collect basic demographic data and provide an estimate of daily displacement flows. The data provides an overview of trends and the volume of flows of returnees but is for information only and has some limitations. While individuals undergo an initial screening by CNARR to determine the status, the additional responses provided by the returnees have not been formally verified. Arrivals through other border crossing points are not monitored and the temporal coverage is limited to working days and does not include weekends or night coverage, hence actual arrival numbers are likely higher. Due to these limitations, the data collected can therefore not be generalized to represent the entire returnee population, as they only present the unique situation of those crossing this boarder point during this window. Please also note that returnees are not registered at this point but are referred to the IOM registration centre at the lyc\u00e9e Adr\u00e9, where in-depth evaluation is carried out, jointly with CNARR, before being registered.\n\nLOCATION OF DEPARTURE (SUDAN)\n\n24%\n\n8%\n\n68%\n\nAl-Geneina Al-Fasher Nyala\n\nRETURNEES IDENTIFIED AT THE ADRE BORDER CROSSING POINT THE PAST TWO WEEKS: SUMMARY STATISTICS\n\n03-Aug\n\n68% Arrived from Al Geneina\n\n04-Aug\n\n05-Aug\n\n06-Aug\n\n94% 5.8 average are female-headed household size households\n\nNUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL ARRIVALS PER DAY\n\n07-Aug\n\n08-Aug\n\n09-Aug 10-Aug 11-Aug\n\n12-Aug\n\n13-Aug\n\n65% mention insecurity as reason for displacement\n\n14-Aug\n\n15-Aug\n\n16-Aug\n\n17-Aug\n\n15%\n\nPROVINCE OF ORIGIN (CHAD) 1% 6% Ouadda\u00ef Wadi Fira 42% Ennedi Autre Sila\n\n36%\n\nPRIMARY REASON FOR DEPARTURE\n\n3% 1% Armed conflict 3% 53% Inter-community conflict 12% Seeking humanitarian assistance 13% Preventive movement Lack of food 15% Other Finding the family\n---\nUSE & DEFINITION OF BIOMETRIC DATA:\n\nThe use of biometrics in registration processes can help to collect data to identify vulnerable individuals who may require additional assistance. This may require several and ongoing evaluations. In the case of Deguessa and Tongori, these assessments were completed as a first initial phase and would require future updates to keep abreast of population movements and its evolution. IOM underlines the importance of using biometrics responsibly and, notably, of ensuring the protection of personal data of beneficiaries and respect for the rule of law. When processing biometric data, IOM ensures that the data is collected in a lawful and fair manner with the consent of beneficiaries, and that the purpose of the processing is specified and legitimate.\n\nMETHODOLOGY & LIMITATIONS:\n\nThe data presented on registrations is not exhaustive and does not contend that all returnees are accounted for, nor is not representative across provinces. The returnee data compiled above, presents a summary of all assessments conducted on a spontaneous and sporadic manner based upon knowledge of movements at different points in time and may be outdated. The registration centre at the lyc\u00e9e d\u2019Adr\u00e9 is the only continuous registration site of IOM. As of the 12th of July 2024, a pre-identification of returnees is conducted at the border, before a proper evaluation and registration takes place at the centre.\n\nCapacity building of returnees on hygiene and sanitation in Deguessa\n\nFor more information, please contact Jonathan Baker, Emergency Coordinator (Sudan Response) Email: jobaker@iom.int", "62547": "title: EXTERNAL UPDATE Central African Republic (CAR) \u2013 SUDAN SITUATION 9 \u2013 15 August 2024 \n content: EXTERNAL UPDATE Central African Republic (CAR) \u2013 SUDAN SITUATION 9 \u2013 15 August 2024\n\nIn addition to attending French language classes at the local school during the week, Sudanese youth and adolescents are leading an \u201cEnglish Club\u201d on the weekend to keep learning seven days a week. \u00a9UNHCR/ Ph. Coco Elizabeth\n\nHighlights \u25aa In Birao (Vakaga prefecture), a UNDP mission took place in the framework of an African Development Bank (AfDB) funded stabilization programme to support the region, which has welcomed some 15,000 Sudanese refugees. In coordination with UNHCR, a series of meetings took place with governmental and humanitarian partners to discuss the implementation of the stabilization programme to support the resilience of refugees and the host community. \u25aa To strengthen partners' capacity for international protection, UNHCR organized a training session for 24 staff members from its partners, including government partners, the National Commission for Refugees (CNR), the Support Project for the Return and Reintegration of Central Africans (PARET), and the NGOs NOURRIR, INTERSOS, and the African Initiative for Relief and Development (AIRD). \u25aa During the reporting week, a relative calm has been observed in the prefectures of Haute Kotto and Ouaka hosting refugees, primarily due to the deterrent patrols conducted by the police forces and the Central African Armed Forces (FACA). However, the security situation remains concerning due to the increased incursions and activities of non-state armed groups targeting the civilian population. Cases of theft, robbery, extortion, illegal taxation, incursions, and forced labour are regularly reported.\n---\nPopulation Movements and Registration The Central African borders remain open for Sudanese fleeing Sudan. This week, 25 families (116 Sudanese) were registered in Korsi/Vakaga. To date, 6,174 families (14,275 Sudanese) are living in Korsi. Among them, 7,658 are women. In August, the arrival trend is 110 individuals per week compared to 124 in July, 204 in June, and 231 in May. The decrease is due to the rainy season. As of 11 August, the Central African Republic was host to 28,871 registered Sudanese refugees since April 2023.\n\nIn the Bamingui-Bangoran prefecture, the number of registered Sudanese refugees remains at 682 families (2 399 individuals) in Nd\u00e9l\u00e9, Akroussoulbak, Koundi and Zobossinda.\n\nIn the Haute Kotto prefecture, the biometric registration of Sudanese refugees in the Ouandja Kotto, Bria, and Ippy records 976 families (2,974 individuals). This week, the National Commission for Refugees (CNR) conducted protection interviews with the newly arrived Sudanese, identifying 77 families (371 individuals).\n\nProtection In Vakaga prefecture, UNHCR\u2019s partner INTERSOS, through its protection monitors, conducted 32 protection monitoring visits in Birao and Korsi, enabling the team to collect information relating to the protection situation. INTERSOS monitors also conducted perception surveys among newly arrived refugees in Korsi, provided psychosocial support to gender-based violence (GBV) survivors visiting the safe space, identified people with specific needs (PSNs), monitored the protection environment, supported community relays in conducting proximity awareness-raising, and held a coaching session with community relays. Following these visits, 72 protection incidents were identified and documented, including 45 cases of property rights violations, six violations of physical integrity and cases of gender-based violence (GBV). These incidents affected 68 members of the host community and four Sudanese refugees.\n\nIn addition, INTERSOS in Am Dafock carried out seven border monitoring visits. These visits enabled the team to monitor the protection environment, collect protection incidents in the area, conduct household surveys among returnees, provide psychosocial support to GBV cases in the safe space of Am Dafock, and identify PSNs.\n\nINTERSOS conducted 12 perception surveys in Korsi with newly arrived refugee families. The protection issues identified during these surveys are linked to the living conditions in Korsi, the need to consider asylum procedures, and the provision of food assistance to benefit from food aid.\n\nUNHCR\u2019s governmental partner Projet d'Appui au Retour et \u00e0 la R\u00e9int\u00e9gration (PARET) continues to monitor the spontaneous returns of CAR refugees from Sudan. This reporting week, PARET registered five families of 25 returnees in Birao. Since the beginning of the Sudan crisis in 2023, PARET has registered 1,736 families of 6,231 returnees from Sudan. Among these families, only 396 of 1,233 people have received cash assistance from UNHCR due to resource limitations.\n\nUNHCR provided in-kind clothing assistance to six PSNs in Korsi. Additionally, INTERSOS conducted two educational sessions in Korsi's safe space, focusing on protecting children against malaria and personal hygiene. Forty-seven women and girls attended these sessions.\n\nPrevention against gender-based violence (GBV) In the Haute Kotto prefecture, INTERSOS ensured the referral of documented cases of gender-based violence (GBV) to appropriate services, particularly to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and International Medical Corps (IMC), for medical, legal, and psychosocial support to survivors.\n\nThis week, UNHCR\u2019s partner, INTERSOS, in collaboration with community structures in Bria and Ouandja- Kotto, conducted eight awareness-raising sessions on the consequences of female genital mutilation (FGM), the types of GBV, and their consequences, reaching 230 people.\n\nIn the Vakaga prefecture, GBV incidents affecting refugees and host communities have been identified and documented in safe spaces within the Vakaga prefecture, including Birao and Am Dafock. Case managers provided psychosocial support to GBV survivors in safe spaces; 13 medical referrals were made to IMC clinics in Am Dafock and Birao for better care; two referrals were made to the Police Office station in Birao for juridical support; and one case was referred to the Birao Health District for psychosocial\n---\nsupport.\n\nTo strengthen accountability towards refugees, UNHCR\u2019s partner INTERSOS conducted three awareness sessions for refugees in Korsi on the collective feedback mechanism, complaint management, and procedures during distributions. This activity aimed to educate refugees about their rights and responsibilities in humanitarian activities and encourage responsible behavior during distribution of assistance. These sessions reached 321 individuals.\n\nEducation The academic support classes for learning French during the summer holidays continued in collaboration with the Academic Inspectorate and the Birao School District; 762 refugee, IDP and host community children attended classes. In addition, UNHCR\u2019s education partner INTERSOS completed the recruitment of additional teachers to strengthen teaching and reduce class sizes.\n\nUNHCR\u2019s partner NOURRIR started the construction of 126 concrete desks in the existing classrooms at the Nguerendomo School in Birao. Simultaneously, six classrooms, two directors' offices with storage, and an administrative building for the Academic Inspection are underway.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a significant increase in enrollments at the Korsi child-friendly space, with 226 children participating this week, including 125 girls (55%), compared to 172 children (45% girls) the previous week. Recreational activities continued, and three group therapy sessions were held for these children. These activities took place in children's clubs and were facilitated by ten young volunteers, including six Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) focal points and four community relays, mobilized from the refugee, internally displaced (IDP), and host communities.\n\nEducation activities are supported by Education Cannot Wait\u2019s First Emergency Response Grant for the Central African Republic, which is part of the support for the Sudan Situation.\n\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) This reporting week, 11 additional operational emergency latrines were constructed in Korsi, totaling 174, with 81 persons per latrine compared to 86 last week and 90 the previous week. However, the number of showers remains at 241, with 58 persons per shower.\n\nThe potable water supply for 14,275 refugees is 140,000 litres from three functional boreholes in Korsi. The average per-person quantity remained at 9.9 litres/person/day, below the emergency standard of 15 l/p/d.\n\nA training session for hygiene promoters focused on viral hepatitis E marked the week in Korsi. In addition, awareness activities reached 945 people on methods to prevent viral hepatitis E, maintain domestic hygiene, and ensure the cleanliness of water points, latrines, and showers.\n\nFood security NOURRIR provided 4,595 hot meals to new arrivals and refugees without a ration card using food donated by WFP and 4,386 breakfasts with food donated by UNHCR. A significant decrease has been observed compared to the previous week, with 11,424 hot meals and 11,267 breakfasts provided, mainly due to the World Food Programme (WFP) distribution of dry food. Once the new arrivals receive these dry food rations, they no longer benefit from hot meals.\n\nCash Assistance WFP provided conditional cash assistance for food to 302 families of 886 Sudanese refugees in Nd\u00e9l\u00e9 in the Bamingui-Bangoran prefecture.\n\nHealth and Nutrition\n\nThis reporting week, the medical teams of NOURRIR and IMC conducted 1,133 curative consultations, of which 98 benefited the host population of Birao and 1,035 to Sudanese refugees living in Korsi. Among the latter, 102 patients were new arrivals. Other medical interventions included gynecological, prenatal, and postnatal consultations for 77 Sudanese refugee women. Additionally, five secure deliveries were\n---\nassisted this week in Birao, bringing the total to 89 deliveries and 92 births since the beginning of the year. This week, 13 patients were referred from Korsi to the Birao District Hospital for better care.\n\nRegarding nutritional health, this week, 15 new cases of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) affecting children aged six to fifty-nine months and five cases of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) were screened and taken care of.
