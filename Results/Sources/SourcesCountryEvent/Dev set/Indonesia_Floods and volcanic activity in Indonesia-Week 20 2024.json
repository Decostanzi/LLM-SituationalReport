There is a high demand among officers to learn about conducting locust surveys and control, with some teams needing a refresher on the procedures. With the help of VR technology, training for both groups will expand, leading to more people being informed about locust surveys and controls in the countries,\u201d said Keith Cressman, Senior Locust Forecasting Officer at FAO.\n\nHow the VR in locust training works\n\nThe users train in a locust-related environment virtually using VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes and a motion controller.\n\nThis training is designed to be independent of locust presence, enabling member countries to regularly update locust specialists on identification and mitigation techniques.\n---\nEach person can access the platform from wherever they are without the need for the internet.

We know about climate change, we have stored water, we built roofs to protect our peppers from the hot weather, but it was not enough.\"\n\"So many pepper plants are dying,\" he said, adding that he no longer goes to his farms because it is too painful.\n\"This year we think we will get nothing,\" he said, adding that what little can be harvested is of lower quality because of the weather.\n'Fight against nature'\nKampot pepper gained global acclaim during the French colonial occupation of Cambodia when it was exported widely, but the industry was nearly wiped out during the Khmer Rouge era.\nIn more recent years it has bounced back, gracing hip restaurant menus across the globe.\nThe pepper comes in green, black, red and white varieties -- the color changes as the corn ripens, with green the youngest and white the most mature.\nLay said consumers had no idea of the difficulties facing Kampot farmers, but they will soon see the effects.\n\"For 2024 and 2025, we won't have abundant pepper for them to eat,\" he said.\n\"It is zero!\"\nKann Sinouch, president of the Kampot Pepper Promotion Association, said he expects this year's pepper yield to be halved -- and warned of an export shortage in 2025.\nHe told AFP the changing weather meant farmers were unable to expand their farms, and instead were stuck struggling to keep their existing plants alive.\nBut Chan Deng, who has been growing pepper since the 1960s, said he would not surrender to the unpredictable weather.\n\"This year, it is strangely hot,\" Deng, 67, said.\nHis pepper yield plummeted from 300 kilos last year to around 10 kilos in 2024, with 20% of his plants dying due to the hot weather.\nBut Deng said he will dig more ponds to store water, hoping that in three years a good yield will return.\nIn the meantime, he said, \"we will fight against nature.\"", "48117": "title: Act now or many more will die \n content: Debris and mud cover the ground in Simpang Manunggal on May 12, 2024, the day after a lahar hit the area in Lima Kaum district, Tanah Datar regency, West Sumatra.

(Antara/Sigit Putra)\nDespite previous galodo occurrences, neither authorities nor local residents appeared to understand the danger that lay ahead or what measures should be taken to mitigate loss of life and property.\nW e are saddened by the flash floods and lahars (a mixture of water and volcanic rock fragments) that hit a number of regions surrounding Mount Marapi in West Sumatra on May 11, leaving more than 60 people dead and 14 others missing. Some natural disasters are unpredictable, but losses of life are preventable with well-prepared mitigation and alert systems.\nEven hydrometeorological disasters such as flash floods, landslides and lahars, can be well anticipated to prevent material and immaterial losses, including casualties.\nCoordinating Human Development and Culture Minister Muhadjir Effendy acknowledged that the recent West Sumatra catastrophe showcased the government\u2019s \u201cstupidity\u201d. Muhadjir was referring to his ranks\u2019 indifference toward the natural disasters that had occurred repeatedly across the province since the beginning of this year.\nThe Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) confirmed separately that the West Sumatra government has no early warning system in place for flash floods or lahars. Local authorities have so far relied on BMKG weather forecasts, which normally do not adequately explain to the public the extent of potential damage.\nIndonesia, indeed, never seems to learn from past mistakes. Statistics show that predictable disasters like floods and landslides continue to claim many lives. According to National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) data, 22,435 people have been killed in 7,917 flood disasters and another 3,212 in 7,057 landslides since 2015.\nMitigation efforts and early warning systems for such hydrometeorological disasters is ever more important as these catastrophic events become more common, particularly amid the worsening climate crisis.\nViewpoint Every Thursday Whether you're looking to broaden your horizons or stay informed on the latest developments, \"Viewpoint\" is the perfect source for anyone seeking to engage with the issues that matter most.

Although Indonesia did not experience the intense heat wave that swept across South and Southeast Asia, the country\u2019s temperature did increase because of climate change and the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon, among other things.\nThe recent calamity in West Sumatra is not a first. Local residents even have their own term to describe the flash floods that feature deposits of volcanic material from Marapi\u2019s eruption \u2013 galodo.\nAnother destructive galodo occurred in April 1979, destroying five villages in the regencies of Agam and Tanah Datar. It claimed 60 lives and left 19 missing. Similarly deadly volcanic mudflows occurred in 2009, 2010and 2017.\nDespite experiencing a number of galodo, neither authorities nor local residents appeared to understand just how dangerous the events can be or what measures should be taken to escape from them and survive.\nShortly after the 1979 galodo, some affected villages were relocated but people kept returning to disaster-prone areas. On the other hand, various businesses, such as cafes, were also established in dangerous places, such as on cliff edges and riverbanks.\nThe newly built Xakapa caf\u00e9, situated on the riverbank across from the popular tourist destination Lembah Anai waterfall in Tanah Datar, was swept away during the May 11 flood. The disaster also wreaked havoc on some other eateries and entertainment venues nearby.\nThe monstrous, fatal calamity should serve as a wake-up call for the government to prepare a series of disaster mitigation efforts, such as identifying disaster-prone areas, relocating buildings to safe areas and implementing an end-to-end early warning system that informs residents about dangers as well as how and where to evacuate.\nThere is also an urgent need for routine evacuation drills for the local community to improve their readiness for flash floods and lahars. Nature conservation is equally crucial because disasters like floods and landslides are often caused by natural destruction such as illegal logging and massive land conversion.\nNatural disasters are projected to become more frequent and catastrophic in the future as climate-related problems increase. Disaster-prone Indonesia must learn from past calamities to prevent fatalities.

Last week, a Fano representative from Gojam indicated that it had not been officially invited and that it would not participate due to the government\u2019s heavy influence over the Commission. The Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) \u2014 referred to by the government as the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF)-Shane \u2014 has likewise indicated that it was not officially invited and will not participate.

Their number increased to 39 in 1992.The number of critical watersheds climbed to 62 in 1998, and then rose further to 108 in 2020.Director general of watershed control and forest rehabilitation at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Dyah Murtiningsih, said that a rise in the number of critical watersheds would have a big impact on climate change.According to her, approximately 12.7 million hectares of critical land in Indonesia and 4,200 watersheds need to be restored, and could have a big influence on climate change.The function of a watershed \u2014 as a topographic divider between rivers and lands \u2014 is to accommodate, store, and channel the rainwater falling into rivers until it streams into lakes and the sea.When watersheds reach a critical state due to deforestation, illegal logging, waste disposal, or uncontrolled land conversion, it results in water balance imbalances, shallowing due to sediment, and damage to nutrients and biodiversity habitats.Therefore, continuous watershed conservation efforts and community involvement are vital.River defenders making a biopore at Saung Alkesa in Bogor city, West Java, on May 11, 2024. (Antara/Devi Nindy)One of the efforts to conserve watersheds has been made by Ciliwung River activist, Suparno, and other river defender volunteers at Saung Alkesa on the banks of Ciliwung River in Bogor city, West Java.Saung Alkesa is a public space, built by River Defender Ciliwung and local community to start the watershed conservation efforts and to be a place of learning for visitors.For example, agroup of students and a community of cyclists visited Saung Alkesa on May 11, 2024, to watch Suparno and the river defenders make a biopore infiltration hole.\"Biopores can be used to absorb rainwater and control puddles. The organic waste put in them can be used as solid fertilizer,\" Suparno said.Biopores can reduce the formation of leachate, or rotten liquid formed from the exposure of organic waste piles to water, which can damage the ecosystem and the safety of raw water in Ciliwung River, he informed.Down at the river on May 11, Suparno invited visitors to find different types of rubbish such as textile waste, baby diapers, optical cables, and even medical waste \u2014all things that should ideally not be there.Visitors were given an understanding of river clean-up through fun methods, such as walking along the river and working together to remove waste from the middle of the river.Suparno, who is also a member of the Ciliwung Naturalization Task Force, decided to become a river activist or \"defender\" after he realized the importance of essential human needs such as oxygen and water and riversare an important source of surface water and are vital for human needs for clean water.He and his colleagues began to take part in water conservation efforts by inviting people to directly see and do something about the condition of the river.expects that such efforts will influence and prompt many parties \u2014 both government and private, individual communities, and groups \u2014 to protect rivers.He said that Ciliwung River's water is still accessed by the Regional Drinking Water Company (PDAM) of Bogor city, Bogor Regency, Depok city, and Jakarta.If the quality of the water worsens, it will threaten the health and water needs of the civil society, government, and industry that depend on it.\"Because of water security, the availability of sufficient clean water will have a big impact on our health and sufficient food. But when the availability of healthy water is reduced, or even threatened, the next threat is our food security,\" Suparno explained.A group of students visiting Saung Alkesa removing rubbish from Ciliwung River, Bogor city, West Java, on May 11, 2024. (Antara/Devi Nindy)Saung Alkesa is just one of Suparno's initiatives. According to him, the steps to restore and conserve the Ciliwung watershed will still take a long time to complete.\"Personally, I am the person who does not accept it when the rivers are insulted by humans with rubbish produced by individuals or groups, or by the community. Either directly dumped the trash in carts, thrown, or dumped on the banks of the river, \" he said.So, from March 2009, Suparno collaborated with the Ciliwung Care Community () to protect the river, until he joined the Ciliwung Naturalization Task Force in 2018.The task force provides community assistance for dense traditional settlements and riverbanks in two neighborhood units in 13 sub-districts of Bogor city every day. It works at some crucial locations that do not have access to waste transportation.As members of the task force, he and his 49 colleagues are trying to get the community involved in managing waste so that it does not enter water bodies.He has also been advising riverbank dweller against making sheet piles on rivers, and instead, let the vegetation grow naturally so that if the river discharge is high, water can be absorbed from the side by plants around the watershed.However, according to him, the big task of preserving the Ciliwung watershed, as with other river areas, must be a shared responsibility.\"How can we together understand that this need can be guaranteed to be supplied at all times, by all parties, including society? Regardless of gender, race, class, religion. This is a human right, a human right of the universe,\" he said.Suparno further said he hopes that the World Water Forum, which is currently taking place in Bali, will not be mere discussion, but mark the beginning of the understanding that the basic human need for water is facing a very serious threat.He advised that commitments formed after the event consider water as a vital resource that must be protected together. This would ensure that water does not become a trigger for disaster, hostility, or war in the future.Children playing in Ciliwung River, Bogor city, West Java, on May 11, 2024.
