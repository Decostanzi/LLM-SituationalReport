The violence is reportedly expanding there.

Despite Israel\u2019s assurances that Al Mawasi is a safe zone to which citizens can evacuate, it is not safe at all because no where in Gaza is. If displaced people avoid attacks in Al Mawasi many are still subject to impending famine, lack of shelter, spread of disease, and scarce healthcare availability.\nThe designated evacuation site of Al Mawasi is a sandy area which is unsuitable for hosting large numbers of displaced people. It is not a good solution for housing the over 1.2 million people who had been crammed into Rafah, many of them starving, injured or sick including women and children.\nThe healthcare system in Gaza is shutting down with only a third of Gaza\u2019s hospitals partially functioning and the aid system has moved into a new stage of fading, almost at the point of debilitation. Since last Sunday no aid has come into Gaza by land. Israel has sealed the Rafah border crossing which is a key entry point for delivery of humanitarian supplies and aid agencies are almost out of food and fuel in Gaza.

But as Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) and other humanitarian agencies have long made clear: there are no safe spaces in Gaza.

Patients and healthcare workers forced to leave must be urgently protected.\nThe international community knows that this invasion will be a catastrophe.

I am also concerned by reports of indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza.\nSince 6 May, when the IDF issued an evacuation order to Palestinians in eastern Rafah, more than 278,000 people have been displaced. This includes people with disabilities, the chronically ill, older people, the injured, pregnant women, and many others who are physically unable to move without help.\nThe latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah.

Other towns across Gaza, including Khan Younis, which is supposed to receive those who are being displaced from Rafah right now, have already been reduced to rubble, and remain under attack. These are not safe places.\nI have repeatedly expressed my alarm about the catastrophic impact of a possible full-scale offensive on Rafah, including the possibility of further atrocity crimes.

The entire population of Gaza is currently facing acute food insecurity, including one million people for whom famine is imminent.\nGlobal Communities has escalated its operations, including the addition of a new distribution site, to accommodate the increased demand for food. To date, our Palestinian-led team has provided nearly 2.1 million hot meals to those in need.

A new report reveals his administration has indefinitely halted an investigation into potential Israeli war crimes ( AP )\nDemocratic Senator Peter Welch, an outspoken critic of the Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) conduct in Gaza, called on the Biden administration to halt Israeli aid on Tuesday. He argued the US is already in violation of the Leahy Law.\n\u201cWe write with concern regarding the US government\u2019s failure to apply the Leahy Law consistently to all recipients of US security assistance,\u201d Mr Welch wrote in a letter co-signed by eight other lawmakers.\n\u201cRecent articles documented that successive administrations have neglected to implement the Leahy Law in Israel,\u201d he continued.\nLast week, dozens of lawmakers also called on the Biden administration to reconsider aid to Israel.\nA coalition of 88 Democratic members wrote to the White House on Friday, arguing that Israel\u2019s \u201crestrictions on US-backed humanitarian aid efforts have contributed to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster for Palestinian civilians and to credible reports of famine in parts of Gaza.\u201d\nLast month, the White House said future US aid was contingent on Israel announcing \u201ca series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Israeli forces have taken control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, which borders Egypt in southern Gaza, the Israeli military confirmed.\nThe Palestinian health ministry says Israel\u2019s continued assault on Gaza has killed almost 35,000 people, most of whom were women and children. The United Nations also says that restrictions on humanitarian aid have created a \u201cman-made famine,\u201d with half the 2.3 million strong population of the strip at catastrophic levels of hunger.\nThe attacks on Gaza come after 7 October, when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 people hostage.\nAlso this week, Hamas accepted a proposed ceasefire deal over the war in Gaza. Israel, however, has rejected it and talks over a truce are said to be continuing.\nThe Independent has contacted the National Security Council and the State Department for comment.", "30893": "title: The Guardian view on hope and despair in Gaza: attacking Rafah will compound this disaster \n content: Men, women and children danced in the streets of Rafah on Monday after Hamas said it had approved a ceasefire deal. There was little to celebrate. Hours later, Israel ordered 100,000 in the city to flee and protesters took to the streets in Israel warning that the government was endangering the lives of surviving hostages taken on 7 October. Shortly afterwards, Israeli forces took control of the Palestinian side of the crossing with Egypt \u2013 the key entry point for aid \u2013 and shut off supplies.\nHopes of a deal have been raised and dashed repeatedly. There are differing accounts of what precisely Hamas agreed to, including the timing of hostage releases and \u2013 most painfully \u2013 whether their figure includes the dead as well as the living. Continued fighting does not negate negotiations to end a conflict. But the end of the war is likely to mean the end of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s prime ministership and polling suggests that while most Israelis prioritise a deal to release hostages over military action in Rafah, that is reversed among the rightwing voters on whom Mr Netanyahu\u2019s future rests.\nThe Biden administration is desperate to close down a conflict that threatens further regional escalation and is costing it precious domestic support in an election year. A week ago it told Hamas that Israel had made an \u201cextraordinarily generous offer\u201d; this time, a US official suggested that Israel had not approached the latest talks \u201cin good faith\u201d. Whether Washington will do more than scold remains unclear, though last weekend saw a report that it had put on hold the delivery of ammunition. Joe Biden previously called an invasion of Rafah a red line \u2013 but immediately walked that back.\nThe administration is due to tell Congress this week whether it believes Israel is abiding by international law. Critics have already made it clear that they simply won\u2019t believe any assurance that it is complying on humanitarian assistance. \u201cAnybody with eyes to see and ears to hear knows that that\u2019s just not true,\u201d the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen said last week. Pressure is also growing on the UK government over the lack of clear consequences for Israel\u2019s actions in Rafah.\nMr Netanyahu \u2013 an arch political survivor who always plays for time \u2013 may see airstrikes and the seizure of the crossing as enough to keep at bay the far-right ministers he needs to stay in power, without going further. The consequences of these actions are bad enough. Humanitarian relief remains grotesquely inadequate and famine has taken hold. At a time when it is more essential than ever to understand what is happening in Gaza, authorities shamefully shut down the offices of Al Jazeera in Israel, branding the news organisation a threat to national security.\nAn intensification of the operation should be unthinkable: it would vastly increase the disaster. Many of those now in Rafah were forced to flee from other parts of Gaza. Ordering evacuation is pointless when there is nowhere safe to go. Unicef says 600,000 children are in the city. According to Gaza\u2019s health authorities, 14,000 minors have already been killed, along with 6,000 mothers: there are 19,000 new war orphans.\nWhile rumours swirl, and discussions shift, the imperatives are unchanged: an immediate ceasefire, the restoration and ramping up of aid supplies and the release of hostages.

Humanitarian actors see no significant improvement from Israeli authorities in addressing the dire challenges to provide life-saving aid for Gaza's 2.3 million residents, including those in northern Gaza who according to the World Food Programme's (WFP) Executive Director Cindy McCain are living under a \"full-blown famine.\" The current situation is expected to deteriorate even further as Israeli forces issue \"evacuation\" orders to more than 100,000 civilians in parts of Rafah and should the Israeli military ground offensive on Rafah move forward. No aid entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing on May 5 and no aid entered Gaza through either Rafah or Kerem Shalom /Karam Abu Salem crossings on May 6, 2024.\nMethodology\nThe information outlined in this briefing note is sourced from two key areas: publicly available reports, including those from the United Nations, and insights gathered from the on-the-ground experiences of NGOs. By analyzing public data and connecting it to the seven commitments that were made by the Government of Israel, and by incorporating the ground-level observations and expertise of participating NGOs, this joint briefing note aims to clarify the realities on the ground for humanitarian access into and inside the Gaza Strip.\nThe killing of seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) staff on April 1 brought significant attention to the extreme insecurity Palestinian and international aid workers and civilians alike have faced in Gaza since October 7. The WCK attack showed: no one is safe in Gaza. On April 6, following the outcry of Member States, the Government of Israel made seven commitments in a reported effort to increase humanitarian access into Gaza.\nAs humanitarian agencies with staff in Gaza working around the clock under impossible conditions, we note that the majority of the announced measures have not been implemented, nor has a timeline for implementation been announced. Even if fully met, the realization of these commitments alone would still not provide the conditions for safe, unhindered, principled humanitarian access. To roll back six months of starvation and the collapse of all services and infrastructure amid catastrophic conditions requires much more than mere logistical facilitation: what is needed is a massive flow of humanitarian aid and an immediate and sustained ceasefire.\nFar from witnessing an improvement in access following Israel\u2019s commitments, humanitarian actors are only expecting further challenges as Israel\u2019s offensive on Rafah unfolds.

It follows months-long threats to launch a large-scale ground operation in Rafah, which will further compound the unspeakable suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\u201cIn a cruel and inhumane move that already illustrates the disastrous impact of such an operation on civilians, Israeli tanks have launched a ground incursion on the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, blocking a crucial lifeline for humanitarian aid for a population already facing famine and the risk of genocide.\n\u201cAll states must pressure Israel to immediately halt its ground operations in Rafah and ensure unfettered access for humanitarian aid in line with their obligations to prevent genocide as reiterated by the International Court of Justice on 28 March 2024.\n\u201cThe Israeli military must also rescind their order to civilians to \u2018evacuate\u2019 eastern Rafah unless they can guarantee the population\u2019s safety, which is highly unlikely under the intense military attacks that Israel has been relentlessly conducting for seven months across the entire Gaza Strip.\u201d\nThe extended \u201csafe areas\u201d, proposed for relocation of civilians in the military\u2019s leaflets, lack the most basic standards for safe and dignified living.

The notion that displaced civilians are safe anywhere in Gaza has proved a fallacy time and again as the Israeli military has attacked areas it had previously designated as safe.\n\u201cAs the occupying power, Israel is responsible for ensuring the safety of the Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip, who are protected persons under international humanitarian law, including by providing services and supplies necessary for their survival. Not only has Israel consistently failed to do so, but it has also continued to hinder the provision of such services to Gaza\u2019s civilian population by United Nations humanitarian agencies and international aid organizations since 2007,\u201d said Erika Guevara Rosas.\n\u201cIn the absence of any guarantees for residents\u2019 safety and safe return to their homes, including to areas north of Wadi Gaza, as prescribed by international humanitarian law, the repeated evacuation orders are unlawful under international law and may amount to forcible transfer.

They have forced medical staff to hastily evacuate health care facilities and leave patients behind.\nThe international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) alone has been attacked 20 times, and five of our colleagues have been killed.\nAvril Beno\u00eet, executive director of MSF USA, said of the report:\n\u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s analysis of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has not proceeded as a good faith effort to uphold US law. Instead, excuses about the impossibility of monitoring the deployment of American assistance serve to deflect responsibility.\nThe horrific reality we witness on the ground in Gaza is that Israeli military operations continue to maim and kill civilians and block the provision of lifesaving humanitarian aid. This can\u2019t be chalked up to unintended consequences of war; the massive death, destruction, collective punishment, and forced displacement are the result of military and political choices that blatantly disregard civilian lives.\nAs the leading provider of military and financial support to Israel, the US has an obligation to assess if the conduct of the war is consistent with international and US laws designed to protect civilians and to apply the appropriate legal procedures.\nWhile Israeli authorities have taken some measures to allow humanitarian access, steps taken thus far fall far short of what it promised and what is needed in a place where 85 percent of the population has been forced from their homes. Many live in makeshift tents without even basic necessities such as food, clean drinking water, and toilets.\nIsrael has also failed humanitarian organizations trying to provide impartial aid to people in Gaza. Israeli forces in Gaza and the West Bank have repeatedly attacked our Doctors Without Borders colleagues and facilities, and have failed to establish adequate deconfliction measures to ensure the protection of aid workers and patients. On May 6, a violent Israeli military incursion in Tulkarem and Nur Shams camps in the West Bank damaged a Doctors Without Borders-supported health facility and other essential infrastructure.\nEven when Israel orders evacuations, international law requires it to protect civilians. Its military offensive currently underway in Rafah threatens to shatter the humanitarian response and destroy the local health system that has already been struggling to cope with overwhelming demands for months. A continued military escalation would represent a direct attack on a trapped population, with catastrophic consequences.\nThe closure of the Rafah border crossing makes it near-impossible for humanitarian organizations to sustain lifesaving operations, with fuel, food, medicines, and water supplies all running dangerously low.\nMilitary activity in Rafah has already disrupted Doctors Without Borders operations, forcing us to move staff to safer locations and to anticipate evacuation orders of health care facilities full of patients. The few field hospitals or alternative structures being built will not be able to cope with a massive influx of wounded civilians on top of overwhelming medical needs.\u201d", "38590": "title: 'Not possible': Palestinians too 'starved' to leave Rafah \n content: Three days ago, the Israeli military dropped flyers ordering displaced people and residents of Rafah to leave.\nIn the orders where people were told to move out of Rafah, the military said it was \u201cabout to operate with force against the terror organisations in the area\u201d.\nA UN estimate says there are 1.2 million people sheltering in dire conditions in Rafah, Gaza's southern city.

These people cannot just relocate to another area' - Alexandra Saieh, Save the Children\nRestricted movement\nAid workers also reiterated the difficulty of getting aid both into Gaza and then distributing it. Both the Rafah and the Kerem Shalom crossings, through which most aid reached the besieged Strip, have closed since Sunday evening.\nRoads across Gaza are largely destroyed or blocked by people sheltering, contributing to the difficulty of movement of both goods and people. Only a very limited number of routes, especially between the north and south, are available for humanitarian use, Jeremy Konyndyk, from Refugees International, explained.\nAnother issue is overcrowding.\n\"In Deir al-Balah and the Mawasi area on the outskirts of the Rafah and Khan Younis governorates, there is barely any space. There are tents everywhere, on the beach, on the sidewalks, the streets, the graveyards, the courtyards of the hospitals, in the courtyards of the schools,\" Ghada Alhaddad, from Oxfam International, said.\nSaieh explained that it took her team six weeks and four failed attempts to move a couple of hundred food parcels from Rafah to the north of Gaza.\n\"One litre of fuel cost $40 yesterday,\" according to Ranchal.\nFuel enters through the Rafah crossing.\n\"The whole aid operation runs on fuel. If the fuel is cut off, the aid operation collapses,\" Konyndyk said.\nSevere malnutrition\nProfessor John Maynard, a surgeon from the UK who has spent the last two weeks operating on Palestinians in Gaza, highlighted complications from a direct result of malnutrition.\n'I had two patients, 16 and 18, both of whom had survivable injuries, [and] both of whom died last week as a direct result of malnutrition' - Nick Maynard, surgeon\n\"I had two patients, 16 and 18, both of whom had survivable injuries, [and] both of whom died last week as a direct result of malnutrition.\"\nHis colleague Dr Kahler, spoke of a \"tipping point\" after six-eight months, \"the immunological system breaks down\".\n\"It is at that time when infections and complications from malnutrition will start,\" he added.\nA famine, one aid worker explained, requires three thresholds: a sustained, severe lack of access to food, high levels of child malnutrition, and highly elevated mortality as a result of famine and disease.\nAll thresholds have been passed in the north, Konyndyk stated.\n\"If there is a Rafah invasion, this will certainly push things past the tipping point, and we will see a skyrocketing mortality related to the famine.\"", "38727": "title: Israeli offensive on Rafah throttles essential lifeline for Gaza \n content: In the last three days, virtually no aid has entered Gaza, and essential items like fuel, food, and water are in dangerously short supply.\nThe Israeli offensive on Rafah and the May 7 seizure of the Rafah crossing, a key entry point into Gaza, jeopardize the main lifeline for thousands of people, leaving stocks of fuel, food, medicines, and water dangerously low, and people trapped amid renewed fighting.\nThe lack of fuel will have critical consequences on humanitarian operations, including water distribution, since desalination plants cannot operate without fuel powering their generators, and the operation of hospitals, which only have a few days\u2019 worth of reserves.\nIsrael, under its responsibilities as an occupying force, must either provide electricity or ensure that fuel is available in sufficient quantities, which means the opening of border points.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ordered Israel on two separate occasions to ensure the unimpeded entry of aid into Gaza, without which more people will die from this humanitarian crisis. As long as the Rafah border remains closed, there are no options for humanitarian assistance or for people to go in or out in the south of the Gaza strip, where more than 1.5 million people have fled over seven months of the war.\nThe Rafah border has been closed since it was seized by Israeli forces on May 7, and critical supplies including fuel are running low. What is the impact of the lack of fuel in Rafah?\nThe lack of fuel will have critical consequences on our operations. All the limited quantities of fuel that had been imported daily was automatically distributed and used, with very limited ability to build up a stock for the next few weeks.\nHospitals only have a few days\u2019 worth of stock, according to the World Health Organization. Necessities like hospitals, bakeries, phone networks, and banks rely on generators, which require fuel. Ambulances are also directly affected, and convoys north have been paused due to the lack of fuel.\nMSF teams had to reduce the water trucking distribution system because truck owners cannot move their trucks. The water desalination plants are producing water in minimum quantities to ensure that the plants can keep working; if they stop operation they will not be able resume properly after that.\nMovements of our staff and visits to the health facilities have been reduced to essential movements, because the lack of fuel is putting us in a very critical situation. We have heard testimonies of people in Rafah who are starting to run out of food, water, and essential items.\nIsrael, under its responsibilities as an occupying force, must either provide electricity or ensure that fuel is available in sufficient quantities, which means the opening of border points.\nWhat is the situation for MSF staff? Can they enter or exit Gaza?\nOur staff are not able to enter or exit Gaza at this time. We are working with colleagues inside Gaza, but we don\u2019t have the capacity to turn over and rotate our teams. This will soon create a lack of capacities and proper response from our medical teams to the patients and to a population with only increasing needs.\nThousands forced to flee as Israeli military offensive intensifies and aid is blocked in Rafah\nIs any aid entering Gaza?\nThe Rafah crossing remains closed after its seizure, and although Israeli authorities have announced the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing, no aid has entered the south of Gaza. The Erez crossing in the north of the Gaza Strip is open, and supplies entering through there remain in the north, where they are desperately needed.\nThere was an average of 500 trucks a day crossing through Rafah before the war, 40 trucks per day since the beginning of the war, and that number has now dropped to zero.\nIn the last three days, virtually no aid has entered Gaza, at a time when humanitarian needs are huge. There was an average of 500 trucks a day crossing through Rafah before the war, 40 trucks per day since the beginning of the war, and that number has now dropped to zero. Currently, 1,700 trucks are blocked, lined up in Al Arish, Egypt, waiting to cross.", "38990": "title: Latest Gaza evacuation warnings expose weak spots in Israel\u2019s war strategy \n content: Two elements are particularly striking about the latest evacuation warnings issued by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to residents and displaced people in central Rafah and a considerable part of northern Gaza.\nThe first is that the warnings for Rafah were put at the bottom of leaflets and social media posts, almost as if the IDF was trying to downplay the coming offensive. This may be because Israeli military officials have told the media for much of the week that they were carrying out \u201cprecise, limited and targeted\u201d operations in the city with the sole objective of seizing the key border crossing with Egypt. This is now clearly not the case, if it ever was.\nSuch reluctance to highlight the opening of a new and potentially extremely bloody phase in the war in Gaza is unsurprising. For months, Israel\u2019s most senior officials have threatened a full-scale assault into Rafah to eliminate Hamas forces and leaders based in or under the city, and to retrieve some of the Israeli hostages possibly held there. This is seen as essential to accomplishing Israel\u2019s war aims of \u201ccrushing\u201d Hamas and ending any threat from the organisation.\nHumanitarian officials have warned of a catastrophe if such an attack goes ahead, and Washington made clear it was opposed to any such action without Israel offering a credible plan to safeguard civilians. This, US officials say, they have yet to see. The diplomatic fallout of the new Israeli push is therefore likely to be significant and long lasting.\nThe second takeaway from the warnings is that they call for the evacuation of areas in northern Gaza that have already been the site of repeated Israeli military operations. This is not the first time the IDF has been forced to return to parts of the territory where they have defeated Hamas forces.\nThis underlines how hard it has been, and will be, for the IDF to eradicate Hamas in Gaza.\nSome of the vast tunnel network built by the Islamist militant organisation during its 16 or so years in power remains intact, there are still some residual stocks of rockets with enough manpower to fire them at Israel, and there is sufficient support or fear, or both, among the population to allow Hamas to operate almost everywhere the Israeli forces are absent.\nFor political, diplomatic and economic reasons, Israel does not want to keep large numbers of boots on the ground in Gaza, and has failed to build any kind of functioning administration in areas from which it has supposedly expelled Hamas. These choices have helped its enemies, allowing Hamas to return to former strongholds, now often reduced to rubble. Israel is finding itself caught in the classic trap of counter-insurgent warfare, needing a definitive victory while its enemy needs only to survive.\nThose who suffer most, as ever, are those caught in the middle: the civilians.\nView image in fullscreen Displaced Palestinian children eating broken pieces of bread in a makeshift camp in Rafah. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\nThe human consequences of the new offensive are evident already, with up to a million people already on the move or likely to flee Rafah in the coming days. Their situation in the city had been relatively stable for months, with food supplies improving in recent weeks. Prices for some basics had even fallen to pre-war levels. Small quantities of that most precious of all commodities \u2013 hope \u2013 had even returned among the packed tents and shelters in the city. Now that entire population is being pushed into a new and terrifying precarity.\nFamine now exists in pockets of Gaza, even if food is relatively plentiful in parts of the territory. Doctors report losing patients who would otherwise survive injuries, often inflicted by airstrikes, because they are so weakened by months of malnutrition. This is especially true of children, they say. The supposed humanitarian zones designated by the IDF for evacuation offer pitiful provision for the huge numbers who are fleeing towards them this weekend \u2013 following the instructions in the leaflets. Those who are packing up their fragile shelters in Rafah are all too aware of this but say, almost unanimously, that they have no choice.", "39591": "title: Israel pushes back into northern Gaza, ups military pressure on Rafah \n content: CAIRO - Israel sent tanks into eastern Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip early on May 12, after a night of heavy aerial and ground bombardments, killing 19 people and wounding dozens of others, health officials said.\nThe death toll in Israel\u2019s military operation in Gaza has now passed 35,000, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. The bombardment has laid waste to the coastal enclave and caused a deep humanitarian crisis.\nJabalia is the biggest of Gaza\u2019s eight historic refugee camps and is home to more than 100,000 people, most of whom are descendants of Palestinians who were driven from towns and villages in what is now Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that led to the creation of the state of Israel.\nLate on May 11, the Israeli military said forces operating in Jabalia are preventing Hamas, which controls Gaza, from re-establishing its military capabilities there.\n\u201cWe identified, in the past weeks, attempts by Hamas to rehabilitate its military capabilities in Jabalia.

It said there were no injuries and no damage reported.\nLater on May 12, sirens sounded in the Israeli city of Ashkelon as a result of incoming rocket fire from Gaza, which signalled that militants there were still able to launch rocket attacks after over seven months of war.\nHamas\u2019 Al-Aqsa TV said on its Telegram account that the rockets were launched from Jabalia, despite the active army raid.\nA full-scale Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah \u201ccannot take place\u201d, UN human rights chief Volker Turk said on May 12.\n\u201cThe latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah.

US officials who spoke to reporters appeared to be holding on to hope that it was not the beginning of a sustained operation, though they offered no statements from Israeli commanders to support the view.\n\u201cWhat we've been told by our Israeli counterparts is that this operation last night was limited and designed to cut off Hamas\u2019 ability to smuggle weapons and funds into Gaza,\u201d National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said at a press conference.

Doing so would inextricably deepen US involvement in the conflict, while simultaneously freeing the Biden administration from direct responsibility.\nMr Kirby, questioned by reporters sat his briefing on Tuesday, denied knowledge of this: \u201cI know nothing about your [question].\u201d Miller too denied knowing about those reported plans.\nThe death toll in Gaza is thought to be pushing 40,000 as reports from inside the territory have become increasingly sparse.\nA Politico report on Tuesday separately indicated that a report investigating allegations of Israeli war crimes in Gaza, which the administration is due to present to Congress, is indefinitely delayed.", "40307": "title: UN chief urges \u2018immediate ceasefire\u2019 in Gaza as 35,000 Palestinians killed \n content: Israeli forces launch more attacks on Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza as they increase pressure on Rafah in the south.\nThe United Nations\u2019 Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has renewed his call for \u201can immediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d in the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces have killed more than 35,000 Palestinians in the besieged territory since the attacks began in October, say officials.\nIn a video address to international donors gathered in Kuwait on Sunday, Guterres also called for \u201cthe unconditional release of all captives held by Hamas as well as an immediate surge in humanitarian aid\u201d into Gaza.\n\u201cA ceasefire will only be the start,\u201d he said in the video, cautioning that \u201cit will be a long road back from the devastation and trauma of this war\u201d.\nAs Guterres repeated his plea, Israeli forces hit multiple points in Gaza, displacing anew hundreds of thousands of refugees already fleeing the war.

The denial of humanitarian assistance is a Grave Violation against children, according to the UN Security Council\u2019s 1999 Resolution on Children in Armed Conflict, and illegal under international humanitarian law.\nSince the war started following the attacks on Israel on 7 October, Rafah has been the primary entry point for aid and fuel entering Gaza, with other land crossings only partially or sporadically functioning. Even when open, it has been almost impossible for humanitarian organizations to deliver aid to families. Save the Children\u2019s recent food delivery to families in northern Gaza took six weeks of negotiation and planning and four attempts \u2013 demonstrating the impossible conditions aid agencies have been facing. Starvation must never be used as a weapon of war and is prohibited under international humanitarian law.\nNo aid has entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing since Sunday 5 May, meaning aid agencies are no longer able to get new supplies and assistance into Gaza. Kerem Shalom has also remained closed for aid distribution since Sunday evening.\nGaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said in a press conference on Tuesday that the closure of the Rafah crossing prevented the entry of trucks carrying medicine and medical equipment, and of fuel needed for hospitals. They also said that wounded and sick civilians who were supposed to travel today have been prevented from leaving.\nIsraeli forces must halt operations in Rafah and open all available land crossings to allow aid to enter, Save the Children said.\nXavier Joubert, Save the Children\u2019s Country Director in the occupied Palestinian territory, said:\n\u201c'It was hard to believe that things could get worse given the restrictions already in place - but here we are. Today marks seven months since the beginning of this brutal war, but also one of the darkest days, as the last airway for the aid response is choked before our eyes. Blocking aid puts children`s lives at risk. This assault on Rafah is fatal \u2013 the increase in airstrikes seen so far has already claimed dozens of young lives. Beyond the direct casualties, one million children's lives will hang in the balance.\nAll crossing points into Gaza must be opened immediately to full capacity, and rehabilitated if needed, so that aid groups have safe, unimpeded access to deliver aid to children and families who need it, wherever they are. Without access, the aid response will quickly grind to a halt, wiping out Palestinian children\u2019s chances of survival.\nThere is still time to stop a ground incursion in Rafah. The international community must use all pressure possible to uphold their responsibilities under the Geneva Conventions and prevent the more serious crimes against civilians and against children.\u201d\nSave the Children is calling for an immediate, definitive ceasefire to save and protect the lives of children in Gaza, and for the warring parties to adhere to International Humanitarian Law, for Israel to uphold the International Court of Justice ruling and refrain from actions which undermine the provisional measures indicated by the ICJ.

People were told to evacuate and head to Al Mawasi, a stretch of land only half a mile wide. Despite the dangers, Action Against Hunger will remain in Rafah and continue providing as much humanitarian aid as possible.\n\u201cFollowing the recent evacuation order, Action Against Hunger condemns a possible ground offensive in Rafah, which will result in thousands of deaths and prevent lifesaving aid from reaching the most vulnerable in Gaza,\u201d says Natalia Anguera Ruiz, Action Against Hunger\u2019s Head of Operations for the Middle East. \u201cThe consequences of the offensive will be catastrophic. We are barely managing to provide aid currently.\u201d\nMany people living in Rafah have fled other parts of the Gaza Strip to avoid violence and conflict. Most families are living in tents and without access to clean drinking water, sufficient food, and medicine. A ground offensive in Rafah will only lead to death, destruction, hunger, displacement, and loss in Gaza. It will prevent Action Against Hunger and other humanitarian workers from easily accessing the families who need immediate assistance, especially those already facing dangerous living conditions.\nSo far, around 100,000 people in the eastern part of Rafah have received orders to evacuate, including several members of Action Against Hunger\u2019s staff. Action Against Hunger staff say that they are doing everything in their power to support the team in this extremely dire situation, and have already prepared an alternative refuge for staff and their families in a safer zone. The organization says that this will allow them to continue their tireless commitment to the victims of the conflict.\nOne of Action Against Hunger\u2019s emergency team members, who recently returned from Gaza, says that over a million people in Rafah have \u201calready lost everything: their houses, their savings, everything they built in recent decades. Everything is destroyed, all the health centers, schools, and public services.\u201d\nShe adds, \u201cThere are a lot of people crowded together in places where you\u2019re not meant to live, basically on a desert, without means of subsistence, where you can\u2019t grow crops. There\u2019s no irrigation or safe drinking water. I think of our colleagues and other people who have already displaced multiple times to get to Rafah and will have to take their children, carry them, and walk again. There are no more safe areas to go to.\u201d\nAcross Gaza, men, women, and children are on the brink of famine, facing unsanitary conditions as waste accumulates on the streets and the last of the water becomes contaminated. Healthcare is practically nonexistent.\nDespite continuous global warnings from the international community about the catastrophic impact of a ground offensive in Rafah, the recent evacuation order will also greatly hinder the ability of humanitarian organizations to respond to the basic needs of the population. Action Against Hunger is calling on all actors to do everything in their power to guarantee safe and unobstructed humanitarian access. Without it, there will be catastrophic consequences not yet seen in the last seven months.\n\u201cWe urgently recall the need for an immediate and permanent ceasefire; an immediate release of hostages; safe, effective, and unimpeded humanitarian access; and the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure as the only way to prevent further catastrophe.\u201d says Ruiz. \u201cWhile Action Against Hunger continues to work to provide aid to populations across the Gaza Strip as well as ensure the safety of our staff, we remind the international community that there is no safe place in Gaza.\u201d\nAbout Action Against Hunger\u2019s Work in Gaza\nAction Against Hunger has worked in Gaza since 2005 and the West Bank since 2002.

For immediate release:\n\nIsraAID Vanuatu launched a new program in October on Emau Island targeting stunting, a severe form of malnutrition. Emau is a small island north of the large Efate Island on which Vanuatu\u2019s capital Port Vila is located. It has 6 communities with a total population of just over 900 people. The combined Nutrition and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene program is being carried out in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Shefa Health and is funded by the Canadian Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI). Over seven months, IsraAID Vanuatu will employ household visits to spread information on nutrition and hygiene, helping families understand the root causes of malnutrition and prevent stunting.\n\nAccording to the 2013 Vanuatu Demographic and Health Survey, about 30% of children under five are stunted in Vanuatu. Stunting is an irreversible condition that occurs when children do not receive enough nutrients to develop properly. It can be caused by poor dietary habits or by long-term exposure to fecal matter, which prevents proper absorption of nutrients.\n\nIsraAID Vanuatu will target the six communities on Emau Island, north of Efate, helping families and communities access the information they need to prevent stunting and create the conditions for their children to flourish. IsraAID developed two flipcharts that convey information in an accessible manner. One of the charts addresses hygiene practices, such as proper toilet construction and handwashing. The other chart addresses proper nutrition habits, including findings from a 2023 survey that emphasized the importance of Vitamin A and protein-rich foods in infants\u2019 diets. Village Hygiene Promoters, who are part of and familiar with the local community, will conduct household visits, using the flipcharts to explain and encourage proper hygiene and nutrition. As of April 2024, 65 toilets have been improved to the minimum standard, 15 new toilets have been constructed, and 43 handwashing stations installed. With a total of 206 households on Emau, that means 25% of the households have improved hand hygiene and 43% improved their toilet facilities \u2013 an impressive improvement so far and with several months left in the project.\n\nIsraAID began working in Vanuatu after Category 5 Cyclone Pam displaced a quarter of the country\u2019s population in 2015. Since then, IsraAID has been supporting Water, Sanitation, Hygiene, mental health needs, and prevention of Gender-Based Violence in Vanuatu, supporting the communities' resilience in the face of ongoing climate disasters.\n\nIsraAID Vanuatu\u2019s Acting Country Director Piter Visser said:\n\n\u201cIsraAID Vanuatu is proud to be implementing this important cross-sectoral project to reduce rates of stunting in Emau Island. While stunting is an irreversible condition, it is highly preventable. We\u2019re committed to ensuring that families have the resources and knowledge they need to ensure a brighter future for their children. Thanks to funding from the CFLI, we were able to develop resources to make this knowledge accessible and our door-to-door approach allows us to meet communities where they are.\u201d\n\nTel: +972 (3) 947-7766 Fax: +972 (77) 555-8809 info@israaid.org\n\nisraaid.org\n\nIsraAID is a registered non-profit organization in Israel (Amuta/Org. 580472959) and in the United States as a 501(c)3 (EIN 462118225)\n---\n-ENDS-\n\nFurther information is available on request, including interviews with IsraAID Vanuatu Country Director Piter Visser and other individuals involved in this operation.

CF leaders added that they plan to convene parliament after the deadline to vote on a new speaker. The Taqaddum party of former speaker Halbousi rejected the imposition of a deadline, arguing that the deadlock should be resolved through a political agreement. Sunni parties remain divided on how to proceed. Taqaddum insists that it must nominate the next speaker, but its path is blocked since its former candidate, Shalan al-Karim, withdrew from the race, and the CF refuses to amend parliamentary bylaws to allow new candidates to run. Meanwhile, Taqaddum\u2019s Sunni rivals are in favor of having a vote as soon as possible since their main candidate, Salim al-Issawi, appears to be widely accepted by the CF parties.

On May 8, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) published new data that reflects further increase in the scale of climate-induced displacement affecting communities in southern Iraq. The data shows that as of mid-March, more than 140,000 individuals (comprising 23,364 families) were experiencing displacement due to water shortages impacting twelve provinces. Almost half of the displaced families (10,385) are from Dhi-Qar province, followed by Maysan (5,215 families), Muthanna (2,365 families), and Diwaniyah (1,871 families). The worst affected district is Nasiriyah in Dhi-Qar, which reported 3,902 families displaced, followed by Qalat Salih in Maysan with 2,599 families, and al-Shatra and al-Rifai (both in Dhi-Qar), with 2,461 and 2,082 families, respectively.

We now see the coordination system established there being at risk of disruption -- the warehouses, the vehicles, the offices, the staff accommodation.

UNRWA currently estimates that the population of Northern Gaza and Gaza City governorates is up to 300,000 people. The ability of UNRWA to provide humanitarian support and updated data in these areas has been severely restricted.

Where will be safe?\u201d, they asked me over and over.\nI didn\u2019t have an answer for them because right now, nowhere is safe in Gaza. There is nothing safe about the Israeli-designated \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis \u2013 children have been killed in both of these areas in the past after they were forced to relocate there.

Political will is the only barrier.\nAs well as demanding an immediate and definitive ceasefire, all States must immediately halt the transfer of weapons, parts, and ammunition to Israel and Palestinian armed groups while there is a risk they are used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law.\nI\u2019ve seen the pieces of shrapnel in Gaza that tear through children\u2019s bodies.

The demolitions, the highest in a single day since the demolitions of Al-Araqib in 2010, amount to the forced eviction of over 300 residents of Wadi al-Khalil, one of nine unrecognized villages at risk of forced eviction under the guise of urban development.\n\u201cThe scenes of hyper-militarized police units, including the notorious Yoav and border police units, storming Wadi al-Khalil to bulldoze homes and confiscate residents\u2019 belongings are yet another chilling demonstration of the cruelty and ongoing injustices and human rights violations meted by Israeli authorities upon Palestinian citizens of Israel, especially those living in the Negev/Naqab,\u201d said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\u2019s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\u201cInstead of meaningfully consulting with the local communities in an inclusive decision-making process on planning, infrastructure development and access to land, Israeli authorities, particularly the Bedouin Authority for Development and Settlement, continue to use urban development as a tool to displace Bedouins, disenfranchise them and force them into smaller and smaller pockets of land, in a clear illustration of Israel\u2019s apartheid system. They must immediately stop all forced evictions and ensure those affected have access to effective remedy and those made homeless are granted adequate housing.\u201d\nAmong the units that participated in the demolition is the police unit Yoav, a unit established in 2011 with the declared aim of \u201cenforcing the law\u201d and halting unauthorized construction in Bedouin localities in the Negev/Naqab.\nJabr Abu Assa, a resident of Wadi al-Khalil whose home was demolished earlier this morning, told Amnesty International:\n\u201cWe cannot stop this plan; Highway number 6 would pass over our bodies regardless of how hard we resisted, so we asked the authorities for a fair and just alternative, to relocate us to a place where we can live in peace and dignity, to Mtalla neighbourhood in Tall al-Sabe\u2019. However, the only option we were given is to move to a neighbourhood in the nearby village of Um al-Batin, where local residents already said they have no room for us and that we are not welcome; this means pitting us up against them. This means forcing us and them to have to fight over the scarce resources that are barely enough for them.\u201d\nAbu Assa added that neither he nor any of the residents whose homes and other structures were demolished have received any form of compensation.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where to go next\u201d\nOn 31 December, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the appeal of Wadi Al-Khalil\u2019s residents against their forced relocation to Umm al-Batin, allowing the Bedouin Authority for the Development and Settlement of the Negev, a government body that has long served to entrench the domination and oppression of the Bedouin community, to decide where it can relocate the residents.\nHussein al-Rabaya\u2019a, a community activist from the Negev/Naqab, told Amnesty International: \u201cHere you have no choice: they deny you recognition then they decide to displace you, they decide where you can go, and if you protest and ask for a fair alternative, they say it\u2019s not up to you to decide your own fate.\u201d\nAnother resident of the neighbourhood whose home was destroyed, told the organization: \u201cWe don\u2019t know where to go next; we cannot move to Umm al-Batin because we are unwanted there; we\u2019ll do what the residents of al-Araqib did: we\u2019ll set up a tent on the ruins of our bulldozed homes, we have no other choice.\nThe demolitions in Wadi al-Khalil come less than a year after the Israeli District Court had approved the forced eviction of the unrecognized village of Ras Jrabah, to make way for the expansion of nearby Jewish town of Dimona. The residents of Ras Jrabah remain embroiled in a legal battle against their village\u2019s demolition.\n\u201cIsraeli authorities must put an end to the systematic discrimination and oppression faced by these communities, including by putting an end to forced evictions and the policy of home demolition.

Furthermore, by preventing the sick and injured from receiving treatment abroad, Israel is putting people\u2019s lives in grave danger, especially given the poor quality of medical care available in the Strip as a result of Israel\u2019s genocide, which has specifically targeted the health sector.\nAs the hub for humanitarian relief efforts and the point of entry for life-saving supplies, Rafah is home to numerous operational relief organisations that stockpile food and water, plus health, sanitation, and hygiene supplies for civilians throughout the Gaza Strip. This indicates that the Israeli military operation is likely to intensify its efforts to starve the people of the Strip and worsen the spread of diseases.\nUnder intense Israeli tank and aircraft bombardment, 10s of thousands of Palestinians are attempting to escape from Rafah to Al-Mawasi, west of Khan Yunis. In less than 48 hours, this bombardment has resulted in the destruction of approximately 18 homes, the majority of which collapsed on top of their occupants\u2019 heads, killing 52 Palestinians, including 17 children and 14 women.\nRafah\u2019s man hospital, Abu Youssef Al-Najjar, and a nearby health centre have been evacuated in response to recent Israeli evacuation orders. This will have detrimental effects on health services, especially in view of the closure of the road leading to the European Hospital, and will jeopardise the Kuwaiti Hospital\u2019s remaining services, which include two additional field hospitals and X-ray services.\nThe region\u2019s water pumping has also stopped as a result of the Israeli army\u2019s incursion into the areas east of Rafah, because municipal crews are unable to reach the water pump wells and make repairs. Additionally, the food supplier for Rafah and the rest of the southern Gaza Strip, which is located east of Rafah, is now out of service, which will escalate the famine crisis and is a threat to the diversification of food sources; the entire Strip has already been experiencing a severe hunger crisis for seven months.\nThe forced evacuation of hundreds of thousands of civilian residents does not necessarily mean protecting them from military attacks, as several neighbourhoods in Khan Yunis and Deir al-Balah, which the Israeli army had previously declared to be safe zones, have been repeatedly bombed in recent hours.\nThe Israeli army ordered on 6 May the evacuation of people living in nine eastern Rafah blocks to the \u201cextended humanitarian zone\u201d in Al-Mawasi; the targeted evacuation area was approximately 31 square kilometres. Prior to 7 October 2023, Al-Mawasi was home to about 64,000 Palestinians. It currently houses nine sites sheltering displaced people, three clinics, and six warehouses.\nThe area of Al-Mawasi, which is one kilometre wide and no longer than 13 kilometres, is currently home to over 400,000 people. With its being frequently bombed by Israel and its few options for relief to reach it since the crossings have been closed, it lacks the facilities needed to house these enormous numbers.\nIsrael\u2019s army has ordered the illegal evacuation of roughly 277 square kilometres, or roughly 76% of the Gaza Strip\u2019s total area, since 7 October. This covers every area north of the Gaza Valley, whose residents were told to leave in late October, as well as certain areas south of the Gaza Valley that have been under constant evacuation orders from the Israeli army since 1 December 2023.\nIsrael apparently intends to launch a massive attack on Rafah\u2014announced 213 days into its ongoing genocide\u2014without considering the fate of the hundreds of thousands of residents and displaced people who have sought refuge there after the Israeli army previously declared it a safe zone. Given the volume of displaced people, storming the city poses a serious threat of massacre and raises urgent concerns about the scenario of forced displacement outside the Gaza Strip.\nThe international community must uphold its legal and international obligations to stop Israel from committing the crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, activate effective pressure tactics to stop Israel\u2019s military attack on Rafah, and abide by the rulings of the International Court of Justice in order to protect Palestinian civilians.", "47797": "title: Israeli assault on Rafah may cause \u2018bloodbath\u2019 and famine, aid agencies say \n content: Aid groups have warned of grave humanitarian consequences and drastic cuts to the supply of aid if an Israeli offensive on Rafah goes ahead, after Israel demanded that tens of thousands of people leave the eastern part of the city.\n\u201cA military incursion into Rafah could lead to a bloodbath because of how densely populated Rafah has become,\u201d said Tamara Alrifai, the director of external relations for the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. \u201cAnother looming displacement is already creating panic and anxiety among a highly vulnerable population.\u201d\nAn estimated 1.4 million people have gathered in Rafah after repeated Israeli evacuation orders forced them south towards areas previously marked as safe zones.

Data from the UN shows that no aid trucks were allowed through Rafah on Sunday. It was reported that 128 trucks entered through Kerem Shalom on Sunday, despite a Hamas rocket attack that killed four Israeli soldiers. The shipments were a fraction of the aid that relief groups say is needed to stave off rising famine across Gaza.\n\u201cThis is extremely concerning as these are the only two crossings open for humanitarian access and commercial goods,\u201d Alrifai said. \u201cIf the crossings are closed, this means no commercial or humanitarian supply lines are active, so people in Rafah will not have access to humanitarian assistance. This means we can expect the famine to move south.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Displaced Palestinians head for Khan Younis from Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on 6 May.

Even if we did have that, the fact that the Rafah crossing has closed and this is the only crossing point for fuel means even if we had a base of supplies we can\u2019t necessarily move these around due to the low fuel supplies.\u201d\nAreej Saqqa, of Euro-Med for Human Rights, said she and her husband had fled Rafah for Gaza\u2019s middle area in the early hours of the morning as the situation had become so difficult. The roads were crowded with others fleeing amid fears of an invasion, she said.\n\u201cPeople are very afraid, and the prices of goods have risen again with the closure of the Rafah crossing,\u201d said Saqqa, adding that price of basic goods such as tomatoes, potatoes or bottled water had doubled.\nHisham Mhanna, of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said that like Unrwa his organisation did not intend to move its operations out of Rafah, but it feared that an escalation would make it \u201cdifficult to help anyone\u201d.\nView image in fullscreen People flee the eastern parts of Rafah ahead of the threatened Israeli assault.

It follows months-long threats to launch a large-scale ground operation in Rafah, which will further compound the unspeakable suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\u201cIn a cruel and inhumane move that already illustrates the disastrous impact of such an operation on civilians, Israeli tanks have launched a ground incursion on the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, blocking a crucial lifeline for humanitarian aid for a population already facing famine and the risk of genocide.\n\u201cAll states must pressure Israel to immediately halt its ground operations in Rafah and ensure unfettered access for humanitarian aid in line with their obligations to prevent genocide as reiterated by the International Court of Justice on 28 March 2024.\n\u201cThe Israeli military must also rescind their order to civilians to \u2018evacuate\u2019 eastern Rafah unless they can guarantee the population\u2019s safety, which is highly unlikely under the intense military attacks that Israel has been relentlessly conducting for seven months across the entire Gaza Strip.\u201d\nThe extended \u2018safe areas\u2019, proposed for relocation of civilians in the military\u2019s leaflets, lack the most basic standards for safe and dignified living.

Most of the residents ordered \u2013 yet again \u2013 to \u201cevacuate\u201d have already been displaced on multiple occasions since October 2023.\n\u201cPalestinian civilians in Gaza are human beings, not pawns to be moved around a chessboard at the whim of the Israeli authorities.

Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International\u2019s Senior Director of Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns\n\u201cAs the occupying power, Israel is responsible for ensuring the safety of the Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip, who are protected persons under international humanitarian law, including by providing services and supplies necessary for their survival.

It was released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday.\nBut the caveat that the administration wasn't able to link specific U.S. weapons to individual attacks by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.\nThe first-of-its-kind assessment, which was compelled by President Joe Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats in Congress, comes after seven months of airstrikes, ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children.\nWhile U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes, the report said that given Israel's \u201csignificant reliance\u201d on U.S.-made weapons, it was \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that they had been used by Israel's security forces in instances \u201cinconsistent\u201d with its obligations under international humanitarian law \u201cor with best practices for mitigating civilian harm.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s military has the experience, technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians, but \u201cthe results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases,\u201d the report said.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defied the growing criticism from its closest ally. the US. In a tweet one of his spokesman quoted him as saying on Friday that Israel had killed \"about 14,000 civilians\" - but claimed it was Hamas's fault because they were being used as human shields.\nInternational human rights groups and a review by an unofficial panel of former State and military officials, academic experts and others had pointed to more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes for which they said there were credible evidence of violations of the laws of war and humanitarian law. Targets included aid convoys, medical workers, hospitals, journalists, schools and refugee centres and other sites that have broad protection under international law.\nThey argued that the civilian death toll in many strikes in Gaza \u2014 such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians \u2014 was disproportionate to the value of any military target.\nIsrael says it is following all U.S. and international law, that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.\nPresident Biden has been carefully balancing his support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign against Hamas. Escalating Palestinian casualties and the onset of famine, largely due to Israeli restrictions on food and aid access to Gaza, have fuelled increasing domestic and international criticism. Tensions escalated further when Netanyahu pledged to intensify the military offensive in Rafah, despite Biden's staunch opposition.\nIn the midst of a challenging re-election bid against Donald Trump, Biden faces pressure from Democrats to halt offensive weapons shipments to Israel, while Republicans accuse him of wavering in his support for Israel.\nIn recent days, the Democratic administration took an initial step toward conditioning military aid to Israel by halting a shipment of 3,500 bombs due to concerns over Israel's threatened offensive in Rafah, a city with over a million Palestinian residents.\nA presidential directive from February required the Defence and State Departments to assess any credible reports or allegations of improper use of US provided military equipment by Israel and to report to Congress accordingly. The directive also mandated reporting on whether Israel blocked humanitarian aid delivery to starving civilians in Gaza.\nAdvocates for the review argued that previous US administrations applied a double standard in enforcing laws governing the use of US support by foreign militaries, a claim the Biden administration refutes. They urged a clear legal determination on whether specific Israeli airstrikes and aid restrictions violated international laws and human rights.\nOpponents contended that a US finding against Israel would undermine its efforts against Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Criticisms of Israel could increase pressure on Biden to curtail military aid, potentially straining relations with Netanyahu's government and jeopardising support from pro-Israel voters in the upcoming elections.\nThe White House initiated the review while addressing Democratic lawmakers' and Senator Bernie Sanders' calls to restrict arms shipments to Israel.\nIsrael initiated its offensive following the October 7 attack by Hamas into Israel, resulting in approximately 1,200 casualties. Since then, two-thirds of the nearly 35,000 Palestinian fatalities have been women and children, according to local health authorities. US and UN officials assert that Israeli food restrictions since October 7 have triggered a severe famine in northern Gaza.", "50014": "title: Panic in Rafah as Israel expands operation, Palestinians ordered to al-Mawasi \n content: May 11, 2024\nRAFAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Amid a state of chaos, panic and despair, tens of thousands of Palestinians are fleeing eastern Rafah, which many had considered their last refuge until Israel dropped leaflets earlier this week ordering them to \u201cevacuate immediately\u201d ahead of a military operation in the southern Gaza city.\n\u201cWe will act with extreme force against terrorist organizations in your areas of residence,\u201d the leaflets read. \u201cAnyone who is near terrorist organizations puts his life and the life of his family at risk.\u201d\nWith that, on the morning of May 6, Israel ordered the evacuation of nearly 100,000 Palestinians from their homes and tents.\nMy family and I had been displaced from our home in Gaza City shortly after the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7.

The army said Hamas fighters had fired at least 10 projectiles from an area near the Rafah crossing toward Kerem Shalom. Israeli authorities closed the crossing temporarily, reopening it on Wednesday.\nOn Monday, Hamas announced that it had accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza after more than 210 days of war. The joy that erupted among the Palestinians in Gaza was short-lived, however, as the Israeli army pushed ahead for an assault on Rafah, where it believes the bulk of Hamas' remaining forces are holed up. Israel said the current terms in Hamas' response are different from what it had agreed to.\nPalestinians\u2019 hopes for an end to the hostilities were dealt another blow on Thursday after the Israeli and Hamas delegations as well as CIA Director Bill Burns left Cairo without reaching a deal on a cease-fire and hostage release deal during a day of negotiations.\nThe most contentious issues appear to be disagreement over a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as demanded by Hamas, and the number and lists of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be freed.\n\u201cWe are sick of it,\u201d said Maha Abu Sharkh, who was displaced with her family from eastern Rafah to the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza.\nAbu Sharkh had fled her home in northern Gaza last year, at the onset of war, to escape Israel's heavy bombardment of the area. In search of safety in the south, she has now been displaced more than four times.\n\u201cI am tired of everything,\u201d Abu Sharkh told Al-Monitor. \u201cI am tired of war, repeated displacement, sleeping in tents, which are cold at night and hot during the days, as our hopes for a cease-fire keep fading.\u201d\nHumanitarian aid stoppage\nMaking matters worse, the movement of residents from Gaza to Egypt and the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave came to a halt after the Israeli army seized control of the Rafah border crossing on May 7, two days after closing the Kerem Shalom crossing, another aid route.\nMany bakeries had to halt operation due to the lack of flour, leaving thousands of the displaced without daily rations of bread.\nMuhammad Abu Saada was supposed to travel to Cairo on May 7 to complete his university studies, but that all changed with the Israeli takeover of the Rafah border crossing.\n\u201cI had been waiting to leave for about two months, and when the time came, the Israeli army took control of the crossing and closed it until further notice,\u201d Abu Saada told Al-Monitor. \u201cI lost my future, and I will not be able to attend university in Cairo.\u201d\nGaza-based political analyst Talal Okal told Al-Monitor, \u201cWhile the entire international community demands that Israel not invade Rafah, its army is moving ahead with its plan, turning a deaf ear to international warnings about the humanitarian risks that such an invasion could entail.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIsrael is proving day after day that it is a state above international law.\u201d\nAccording to Okal, Hamas is interested in signing an agreement that ends the war, but Israel does not want such an agreement, and is using negotiations to buy time and carry out a complete invasion of Rafah.\nIsrael has repeatedly vowed to invade Rafah, which it says is Hamas\u2019 last stronghold, despite warnings of the consequences such an invasion will have on civilians in the city.

It has been closed since.\nIsrael closed a second crossing, Kerem Shalom, after a Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers on Sunday. It said the crossing had reopened on Wednesday, but the U.N. said no aid had passed through yet.\nA third crossing, Erez, has been open only sporadically, humanitarians said.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told his troops Tuesday that the Rafah operation would continue \u201cuntil we eliminate Hamas in the Rafah area and the entire Gaza Strip, or until the first hostage returns.\"\nHumanitarians say the shutdown of the border crossings and the halt to the entry of supplies, including fuel, could risk the near-term collapse of their aid operations, even without a full-scale military operation in Rafah.\n\u201cThe whole aid operation runs on fuel. So, if the fuel is cut off, the aid operation collapses \u2014 and it collapses quickly,\u201d said Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International. \u201cThat means water can\u2019t be pumped, lights can\u2019t be kept on in hospitals, vehicles can\u2019t distribute aid.\u201d\nHe said it comes as the threat of famine is growing across Gaza, not just in the north but also in central and southern Gaza.\n\u201cIf there is a Rafah invasion, that will certainly push things past the tipping point, because then the aid operation will collapse, and then we will see really skyrocketing mortality related to famine,\u201d Konyndyk said.\nDoctors who have worked in Gaza agree.\nBritish surgeon Nick Maynard has been to Gaza twice since the war started with British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. He was evacuated from Rafah on Monday.\nHe told reporters he treated patients who had developed complications and severe infections that were the direct result of malnutrition, because they have weakened immune systems.\n\u201cI operated on many patients in the last two weeks who had awful complications from their abdominal surgery related to inadequate nutrition,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly those with [their] abdominal wall breaking down.

A recent three-day heat wave saw temperatures hit 37 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit). They say clean drinking water is already in short supply, and severe heat will make dehydration a major contributor to deaths.\nAlready more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, and more than 78,000 injured, according to the Gaza-run Health Ministry. Hamas killed 1,200 people in Israel during its October 7 terror attack.\nThe U.N. office for humanitarian affairs said Wednesday that all the main medical facilities in Rafah could soon become inaccessible or inoperable.

Over 390 bodies have been discovered at Nasser and Al Shifa hospitals, including of women and children, with many reportedly showing signs of torture and summary executions, and potential instances of people buried alive,\" the experts said.\nThey noted that women, girls and children overall are among those most exposed to danger in this conflict, and that as of 29 April 2024, of 34,488 Palestinians killed in Gaza, 14,500 have been children and 9,500 women. Another 77,643 have reportedly been injured, of which 75% are estimated to be female. Over 8,000 others are reported missing or under the rubble -- and the experts noted that at least half of them can be assumed to be women and children. They also noted that an estimated 63 women, including 37 mothers are being killed daily and 17,000 Palestinian children are believed to have been orphaned since the war on Gaza began.\n1.7 million people are internally displaced, and 1.1. million are projected to face catastrophic levels of food insecurity. According to UN reports, a number of women and girls have also been forcefully disappeared by the Israeli military since the beginning of Israel's onslaught. The experts noted that Israeli forces had also destroyed Gaza's largest fertility clinic, reported to have been storing 3,000 embryos.\n\"The treatment of pregnant and lactating women continues to be appalling, with the direct bombardment of hospitals and deliberate denial of access to health care facilities by Israeli snipers, combined with the lack of beds and medical resources placing an estimated 50,000 pregnant Palestinian women and 20,000 new-born babies at unimaginable risk. Over 183 women per day are giving birth without pain relief, while hundreds of babies have died because of a lack of electricity to power incubators,\" they said. \"The dreadful conditions have resulted in increases in miscarriages by up to 300 percent. 95 per cent of pregnant and breastfeeding women face severe food poverty\".\nThe experts said women in labour deliver their babies in horrific circumstances.

In addition, an estimated 690,000 women and girls in Gaza who require menstrual hygiene supplies are unable to manage their menstrual cycle in privacy and with dignity with some reports of contraceptive pills being taken to avoid the unhygienic menstrual conditions.\nThey said unprecedented mass destruction of housing and precarious tent living conditions have disproportionately impacted women and girls, including on their personal security and privacy.\n\"Nothing illustrates systematic violence being inflicted on women and their children better than the story of an infant who was saved from her mother's womb after she was killed in an Israeli attack in the Gaza Strip, and died days later in an incubator on 26 April,\" the experts said.\nThey were dismayed at continued reports of sexual assault and violence against women and girls, including against those detained by Israeli occupation forces. The experts said the Government of Israel has continuously failed to conduct an independent, impartial and effective investigation into the reported crimes.\n\"We are appalled that women are being targeted by Israel with such vicious, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, seemingly sparing no means to destroy their lives and deny them their fundamental human rights,\" they said.\n\"Israel must cease all hostilities and States must end the export of all weapons immediately.

Support for the war remains strong but there is fierce criticism of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government, which includes far-right ministers.\nIn the northern city of Haifa, protesters marched behind a banner reading \u201cMay every Israeli parent remember they put their child\u2019s life in the hands of Netanyahu, who fails them\u201d, while hundreds gathered outside the prime minister\u2019s private home in Caesarea, 25 miles (40km) away.\nHopes of a ceasefire deal that would have freed at least some of the 132 hostages thought to be held in Gaza rose briefly last week when Hamas accepted a deal proposed by mediators, but were dashed when Netanyahu rejected the terms.\nFamily members of the hostages, carrying pictures of their loved ones, joined large protests in Tel Aviv.\nNaama Weinberg, whose cousin Itai Svirsky was abducted and killed in captivity, according to Israeli authorities, told protesters that \u201ceven those who managed to survive this long will no longer be among the living\u201d. Officials say between 30 and 50 of the hostages may now be dead.\nThe French public intellectual Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy spoke too, saying the survival of a hostage was \u201cthe highest form of existence\u201d.\nHamas said on Saturday that the British-Israeli hostage Nadav Popplewell had died after being wounded in an Israeli airstrike a month ago, but provided no evidence. The Israeli military did not offer any comment.\nElsewhere in Tel Aviv, police dispersed anti-government protesters \u2013 some waving Israeli flags \u2013 with water cannon and arrested several people. The major highway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was blocked for about an hour. Other protests took place across Israel.\nThough hostage campaigners and anti-government protests often share objectives, they remain separate movements. Some relatives of hostages favour a tough stance and support the government \u2013 a view with widespread backing among Jewish Israelis, polls show.\nProf Vered Vinitzky-Seroussi, a sociologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said: \u201cThe very fact that Netanyahu and some of his fans have made [the hostage crisis] something we argue about is unbearable. This is the most basic commitment a state has to its citizens. What happened on October 7 undermined the basic assumptions of many Israelis. Where was the army?

However, 44% said Netanyahu was right to reject the most recent ceasefire deal with Hamas, against 41% who favoured an agreement.\nSome families have asked that ministers do not attend Memorial Day ceremonies, which will take place at military cemeteries across the country on Sunday and Monday.\n\u201cThis is an event that the failing leadership and the failing security apparatus led us to. Respect the families\u2019 request: Don\u2019t come,\u201d Eyal Eshel, whose daughter, Roni, was killed at an army base stormed by Hamas militants in October, told Israeli Channel 12.\nThe official ceremony on Monday night marking the beginning of Independence Day celebrations has been toned down. In a break with tradition, the ceremony will be pre-recorded without a live audience, and there will be no fireworks.\nBe\u2019eri, a kibbutz close to Gaza which suffered heavy losses in the October attack, refused an invitation to send its security team to light a torch at the ceremony because the \u201ctorch ceremony will be about heroism only, without referring to the tragedy and neglect that meant [whole communities] were left to their fate by the state\u201d.\nThe war in Gaza has lasted longer than many expected, and the decisive victory over Hamas that Netanyahu has repeatedly promised appears elusive. More than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in the conflict, nearly 2 million have been displaced and much of Gaza has been devastated.

Though increased numbers of trucks have reached Gaza in recent weeks, this has not allowed any food to be stockpiled after months of acute shortage.\nLike many others, Lubad feared the halt in aid reaching Gaza would prompt a spike in prices and shortages of basics such as flour, salt, clean water and medicine.\n\u201cThis in itself will cause a disaster, as this will lead to high prices and lead to famine,\u201d she said.\nWitnesses described frightened families leaving Rafah on foot, riding donkeys, pushing trolleys or packed with their belongings into overloaded trucks hours after reading leaflets dropped by the IDF that told residents and displaced people in eastern neighbourhoods to leave.\nThe IDF said they had broadcast instructions through \u201cannouncements, text messages, phone calls and media broadcasts in Arabic\u201d telling residents to head to an \u201cexpanded humanitarian zone\u201d on the coast and around the city of Khan Younis.\nAid agencies said they believe around 200 families every hour had left eastern Rafah on Monday, with similar numbers moving on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe are monitoring displacement going northwards but a major concern is that we don\u2019t have tents. So we are tracking them but \u2026 we are running out of ways to help,\u201d Petropoulos said.\nOthers said they had decided to stay, whatever the risks.\nJihad Ahmed, 62, a retired police officer in Rafah, said nowhere in Gaza was safe for his family of nine.\n\u201cI am very worried as there is no safe place to escape to. I evacuated my family to the centre of Rafah but despite the warnings my son and I stayed at our home for fear that it would be looted.\u201d\nWhile some non-fuel supplies have entered Gaza via the northern Erez crossing in recent days, the UN agencies said this was insufficient and difficult to deliver to Rafah since it meant crossing active combat zones.\nIntense clashes around the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza and near Gaza City have prevented movement of aid convoys in recent days.\n\u201cErez will simply not be enough,\u201d said James Elder, a spokesperson for the UN children\u2019s agency. \u201cIf Rafah gate closes for an extended period, it\u2019s hard to see how famine in Gaza can be averted,\u201d he said.\nThe UN has repeatedly accused Israel of restricting aid access despite famine warnings. Faced with international pressure, Israel had pledged to improve access but says UN agencies are to blame for not distributing aid more efficiently within the enclave.\n\u201cWhere there is hunger in Gaza [it] is orchestrated by Hamas \u2026 but we\u2019re getting as much food aid in as possible. If only Hamas would stop throwing mortars and rockets at the crossing points,\u201d an Israeli government spokesperson said on Tuesday.\nMahmoud al-Louh, who had fled with is family of six from northern Gaza to western Rafah, was clinging to the hope of a ceasefire.\n\u201cI am very worried about having to start from scratch again as we have already been displaced five times but then I am also afraid of losing any of my family members if we stay. In the end I am a father and I have to protect my children and wife, he said.\n\u201cI just pray for a ceasefire soon so we can go home.\u201d", "51722": "title: US working to keep Israel, Hamas engaged in Gaza truce efforts \n content: This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors.

And his acknowledgement that American bombs had been used to kill civilians in Gaza was a stark recognition of the United States\u2019 role in the war.\nThe president has come under extraordinary pressure, including from members of his own party, to limit shipments of arms amid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nThe comment from Biden to CNN is a major setback for Israel\u2019s war. The US is by far Israel\u2019s most important and most powerful ally, and without its support, Israel\u2019s firepower and ambitions in Gaza would be weakened.\nThe Biden administration has for months been putting pressure on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza and to ensure more humanitarian aid can be delivered there.\nThe US has also repeatedly called on Netanyahu and his government to reconsider its plans for a full-scale invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city of Gaza where more than 1 million people are sheltering after fleeing from fighting elsewhere in the strip.\nIsrael has, so far, carried out a limited operation around the city, taking control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing \u2014 a crucial entry point for aid into Gaza \u2014 and carrying out military strikes on the city\u2019s fringes.\nNew satellite images obtained by CNN from Planet Labs show Israel\u2019s attack in Rafah has expanded from airstrikes to ground operations in recent days.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday told some people in eastern Rafah to \u201cevacuate immediately\u201d ahead of a military operation in the city. They were told to go to Al-Mawasi, a coastal town near the city of Khan Younis that aid groups have described as overcrowded and not appropriate for habitation. The UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) estimated that nearly 79,000 people have fled the city since Monday.\nDespite mounting international pressure, the Biden administration has stood firm with Israel until now, delivering weapons and other support. The threat on Wednesday came just a day after Biden used his speech at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum to remind people of the horrors of the October 7 attacks on Israel, when Hamas-led fighters killed around 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 250.

What does that mean? \n content: The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\nA WFP spokesperson later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met \u2014 important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\nThe next IPC report is expected in July. Israel strongly rejects any claims of famine in Gaza, and its humanitarian agency called McCain's assertion incorrect. A formal declaration could be used as evidence at the International Criminal Court as well as at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces allegations of genocide in a case brought by South Africa.\nHere's what we know about famine and the hunger crisis in Gaza.\nWhat a famine means\nAccording to the IPC, an area is considered to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.\nIn northern Gaza, the first condition of extreme lack of food has been met, senior WFP spokesperson Steve Taravella told The Associated Press. The second condition of child acute malnutrition is nearly met, he said. But the death rate could not be verified.\nDoing so is difficult. Aid groups note that Israeli airstrikes and raids have devastated medical facilities in northern Gaza and displaced much of the population. Along with restrictions on access, they complicate the ability to formally collect data on deaths.\nA document explaining famine published in March by the IPC noted, however, that an area can be classified as \"famine with reasonable evidence\" if two of the three thresholds have been reached and analysts believe from available evidence that the third likely has been reached.\n\"The bottom line is that people are practically dying from a lack of food, water and medicines. If we are waiting for the moment when all the facts are in hand to verify the final conditions to scientifically declare a famine, it would be after thousands of people have perished,\" Taravella said.\nThe causes of catastrophic hunger\nShortly after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, Israel sealed its borders with Gaza and for weeks prevented aid from entering. Aid groups have said assistance since then has been restricted to a trickle far below the 500 trucks of aid that entered before the war. Since March, as Israel has pointed to progress, an average of 171 trucks per day have entered Gaza, according to the U.S.-established Famine Early Warning Systems Network.\nOnce inside Gaza, food and other aid doesn't always reach the most vulnerable. Aid groups say access is limited, particularly in the north, due to ongoing fighting and a chaotic security situation.\nNorthern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's invasion and became the epicenter of the hunger crisis, with many residents reduced to eating animal feed and foraging for weeds. The IPC report in March said around 210,000 people in the north were in catastrophic levels of hunger.\nThe very young, the very old and those with health problems are the most affected. On Sunday, a 6-year-old from northern Gaza with cystic fibrosis was taken to the United States on a humanitarian flight after his mother made a video pleading for help. Fadi Al-Zant's jutting ribs and thin arms showed advanced malnutrition.\nHow to avert a famine\nHumanitarian groups say it will be difficult to deliver life-saving aid without a cease-fire. Even with a pause in fighting, some experts say the situation in northern Gaza will have life-lasting consequences, especially for newborns and pregnant women.\nWhile Israel has allowed more aid in recent weeks under international pressure, a humanitarian official for the U.S. Agency for International Development told the AP that since March, northern Gaza has not received anything like the aid needed to stave off famine.

Sugar costs between seven and 10 times more. Though the Kerem Shalom crossing is open, it is too dangerous for aid agencies to collect supplies crossing from Israel.\nAid agencies say they have reserves of fuel for 48 hours, but will then have to shut vital water pumps and bakeries that feed hundreds of thousands of people.

These orders are an apparent prelude to the start of its new military operation, which threatens to execute more than 1.2 million people in the city and is an escalation of Israel\u2019s genocide against Palestinians in the Strip, a crime that has been ongoing since 7 October 2023.\nThrough written leaflets, text messages, and recorded phone calls, the Israeli army has ordered Rafah\u2019scivilian population to move out of the city\u2019s eastern neighbourhoods, particularly the area of Al-Shouka as well as Al-Salam, Al-Geneina, and Al-Byouk, toward the area of Al-Mawasi. However, Israel provided no explanation as to how the civilian population would be safely transported to Al-Mawasi, which is west of the nearby city of Khan Yunis, or how they would be organised upon their arrival.\nMore than 200,000 people may be targeted by the displacement orders, which also affect the Abu Youssef Al-Najjar Hospital, Rafah\u2019s main hospital, as well as the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings. It should be noted that humanitarian aid access through these crossings has been stopped since yesterday afternoon.\nThe Israeli army\u2019s new displacement orders came with a warning that Gaza City and its north \u201cremain a dangerous combat zone\u201d, making it impossible for Palestinian residents to go north. At the same time, airstrikes on residential homes in Rafah have intensified in recent hours, leaving 26 people dead\u2014the majority of them women and children\u2014and dozens more wounded. More people reportedly remain missing under the rubble.\nOrders for the forced evacuation of hundreds of thousands of civilians do not imply that they will be shielded from Israel\u2019s military attacks; this is especially alarming given that the great majority of them have already experienced multiple displacements and have nowhere else to go. Israel launched its first aerial assault on Rafah at the start of its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, during which hundreds of neighbourhoods and residential buildings were struck without prior warning.\nThe Israeli army has been ordering the illegal evacuation of approximately 246 square kilometres, or roughly 67% of the Gaza Strip\u2019s total area, since 7 October 2023. This covers every area north of the Gaza Valley, whose residents were told to leave in late October, as well as certain areas south of the Gaza Valley that have been under constant evacuation orders from the Israeli army since 1 December 2023.\nBefore beginning ground operations, the Israeli army often issues displacement orders that contain a number of serious errors, such as contradicting information and naming areas incorrectly, which prevents displaced civilians from finding safety. Additionally, Israel appears to have violated its obligation to provide \u201ceffective advanced warnings\u201d under international humanitarian law.\nAny Israeli military operation in Rafah poses a grave risk to hundreds of thousands of civilians, particularly women and children. These civilians risk being made victims of horrifying atrocities against them; in addition, they risk the consequences from Israel putting an end to life-saving humanitarian relief efforts throughout the Gaza Strip.\nIsrael apparently intends to launch a massive attack on Rafah, 213 days into its ongoing genocide, without considering the fate of the hundreds of thousands of residents and displaced people who have sought refuge there after the Israeli army previously declared it a safe zone. Given the volume of displaced people, storming the city poses a serious threat of massacre and raises urgent concerns about the scenario of forced displacement outside the Gaza Strip.\nWith its prior military orders to evacuate other areas of the Strip, and the weight of bombing and casualties, Israel is already conducting one of the biggest and most widespread forced displacement operations in modern history. Israel has forced roughly two million Palestinians to relocate and take up temporary homes in shelters and tents, with over half of them centred in the border city of Rafah.\nFurthermore, Rafah serves as a hub for humanitarian relief efforts and the point of entry for vital humanitarian supplies. Numerous relief organisations that supply food and water, plus health, sanitation, and hygiene supplies, to civilians throughout the Gaza Strip, store these supplies in Rafah. Israel\u2019s potential ground incursion poses an existential threat to residents all over the Strip, who are currently struggling to survive, and is expected to worsen the spread of diseases brought on by the military operation.\nA larger wave of displacement, increased overcrowding, and the elimination of opportunities to obtain basic food and water will result from the impending Israeli ground attack on Rafah, which may be the deadliest point of escalation against Palestinian civilians. The Strip\u2019s health system, which is already nearly destroyed, would likely collapse completely. Rafah\u2019s Abu Youssef Al-Najjar Hospital, one of 12 partially operational hospitals in the Strip, out of its total of 36 hospitals, is also targeted by the new evacuation orders. The other 11 hospitals include two in northern Gaza, three in Gaza City, two in Deir al-Balah, and two in Khan Yunis, as well as three in Rafah, central, and southern Gaza. These hospitals are overcrowded with patients, run at a limited capacity, and struggle with a severe lack of fuel, medications, supplies, and personnel.\nIn the southern Gaza Strip, six field hospitals are running at full capacity, and 70 percent of primary health care centres remain unusable.\nAbout 600,000 children are estimated to be sheltering in the city of Rafah, the great majority of whom are either injured, ill, and/or malnourished. It is unknown what will happen to these children, who are among the hundreds of thousands of displaced people who fled to the southernmost point of the Gaza Strip in order to avoid being killed directly or from starvation. This situation requires decisive intervention to stop Israel from escalating its genocide and forced displacement crimes.\nThe international community must uphold its legal and international obligations to stop Israel from committing the crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, activate effective pressure tactics to stop Israel\u2019s military attack on Rafah, and abide by the rulings of the International Court of Justice in order to protect Palestinian civilians.", "54188": "title: Urgent Call: Palestinian Human Rights Organizations Demand Concrete Action to Halt Impending Massacre Amid Rafah Ground Invasion \n content: The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR), Al Mezan, and Al-Haq, vehemently denounce the initiation of the ground invasion by the Israeli military into eastern Rafah. This egregious act stands as a stark testament to the failure of the international community to stop the ongoing genocide in Gaza, as per their legal obligations, and compel Israel to adhere to the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Despite clear legal obligations, Israel\u2019s actions exemplify a blatant disregard for international law and human rights, and underscore the urgent need for decisive, global intervention to prevent further massacres.\nOn 6 May 2024, the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders directed towards eastern Rafah, specifically targeting residents and displaced persons in the Al-Shawka municipality, in the Al-Salam, Al Jneina, Tabet Ziraa, and Al-Bayouk neighborhoods, and blocks 10-16, 28, and 270, who were instructed to \u201cevacuate immediately\u201d and relocate to the so-called \u201cexpanded humanitarian zone\u201d in Al-Mawasi. This directive comes amidst recent announcements by Israeli authorities regarding the expansion of the humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi, encompassing vast neighborhoods stretching from Khan Younis to Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. However, our organizations vehemently reject the notion that any area of Gaza can be deemed \u2018safe\u2019. The reality on the ground is indisputable: nowhere is safe in Gaza.\nAccording to preliminary estimates, the areas impacted by this evacuation order house more than 250,000 individuals \u2014 a significant portion of Rafah\u2019s population of over a million residents and displaced persons. In the area designated for evacuation, both the Karem Abu Salem and Rafah Crossings are located, serving as vital lifelines for the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza. The Abu Yousef Al-Najjar Hospital, Rafah\u2019s primary healthcare facility, is also situated within this designated evacuation zone. Additionally, this area accommodates various schools that are being used as shelters. Furthermore, tens of thousands of families currently reside in makeshift tents after being forcibly displaced from their homes.\nNotably, in the hours leading up to the issuance of the new evacuation order \u2014 specifically, from the evening of Sunday, 5 May 2024, until dawn of Monday, 6 May 2024 \u2014 our field documentation has revealed a disturbing escalation of Israeli attacks in Rafah. According to our reports, Israeli warplanes conducted direct airstrikes on 10 residential homes, seven of which had residents still inside at the time of the attacks. Additionally, agricultural lands across various parts of Rafah were targeted. As a result, 28 Palestinians, including 11 children and eight women, were killed. Many others sustained injuries or remain trapped beneath the rubble, as of time of writing.\nWithin 15 hours from the issuance of the evacuation order, without time for families to evacuate the area, the Israeli war cabinet unanimously decided to proceed with the ground invasion of eastern Rafah. These developments unfold against a backdrop of intensified airstrikes and artillery bombardments by Israeli forces, targeting residential homes, streets, agricultural lands, and farms. Since the early hours of Tuesday, 7 May, Israeli attacks have killed at least 23 Palestinians, including six women and six children, as well as causing numerous injuries and leaving several individuals missing under the rubble of at least two houses. Regrettably, the airstrikes persist, and the toll of casualties and fatalities continues to rise as we issue this statement.\nAccording to our monitoring, in the early hours of 7 May, Israeli forces advanced with their tanks and raided and seized control of the Palestinian side of Rafah crossing. They raised the Israeli flag inside the crossing; this alarming development serves as further evidence of Israel\u2019s intentions to eliminate Palestinian presence in Gaza and to assert control over the land.\nAs a result, Rafah crossing was closed for the movement of people and goods both in and out of Gaza \u2014 including desperately needed, life-saving humanitarian aid. This closure places the lives of hundreds of injured and medical patients at immediate risk, effectively condemning them to death due to the lack of access to medical care. Additionally, the closure would prevent the movement of the few delegations allowed to enter Gaza, including medical and humanitarian missions, further exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and denying essential assistance to those in dire need.\nAmid the intensified attacks, forced displacement persists, instilling a state of terror and panic among residents and displaced persons. This alarming situation underscores the stark reality faced by Palestinians in Gaza, who have nowhere else left to go. As a direct consequence of the ground invasion and eviction orders, the Ministry of Health was compelled to evacuate the Abu Yousef al-Najjar Hospital. At the time of writing, only the Kuwait Hospital and three field hospitals, established during the ongoing genocide, remain operational, further exacerbating the strain on the local healthcare infrastructure.\nOver the past seven months, Israel has demonstrated a blatant disregard for international legal norms and the United Nations (UN), repeatedly violating resolutions issued by the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, and the UN Human Rights Council, as well as provisional measures ordered by the ICJ. The persistent impunity granted to Israel only perpetuates further atrocity crimes, as testified by the beginning of the Rafah ground invasion.\nMere statements alone are insufficient to halt the invasion of Rafah or address Israel\u2019s genocidal military campaign against Palestinians in Gaza. What is urgently required are tangible, decisive actions. Our organizations urgently implore the international community to take immediate and decisive action, utilizing all available means, to prevent further atrocities, including applying and imposing economic sanctions, arms embargo, and other countermeasures until Israel adheres to its obligations under international law.\nLastly, we once again urge the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to immediately issue arrest warrants for every member of the Israeli war cabinet, who are deemed responsible for orchestrating the ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The unanimous decision by the Israeli war cabinet to initiate a ground invasion of Rafah underscores the urgency of holding these individuals accountable.", "54880": "title: Israel launches Rafah offensive it says is start of mission to \u2018eliminate\u2019 Hamas \n content: Israel has launched a major military offensive against Hamas forces in Rafah, Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, seizing control of a key border crossing and cutting off most aid into the territory a day before indirect talks on a ceasefire deal are due to restart.\nImages released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) showed tanks flying large Israeli flags driving through the post and crushing a concrete sign reading \u201cI Love Gaza\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said the offensive would continue until Hamas forces in Rafah \u201cand the entire Gaza Strip\u201d were \u201celiminated\u201d or the militant Islamist organisation begins to release hostages. A government spokesperson described the first stage of a wider effort targeting Hamas.\n\u201cThis is the beginning of our mission to take out the last four Hamas brigades in Rafah. You should be in no doubt about that whatsoever,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe Israeli operation was launched hours after an announcement by Hamas leaders on Monday night that they would accept a recent proposal for a ceasefire deal put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\nAny truce would be the first pause in fighting since a week-long ceasefire in November during which Hamas freed about half of the 250 Israeli and other national hostages seized in a surprise attack into Israel in October. During that exchange, Israel released 240 Palestinians from its jails.\nSince then, intermittent negotiations have foundered over Hamas\u2019s refusal to free more hostages without a promise of a permanent end to the conflict, and Israel\u2019s insistence that it would discuss only a temporary pause.\nIsraeli officials on Monday accused Hamas of \u201cgrandstanding\u201d while Hamas said Israel was trying to undermine efforts to end the seven-month-long war that has laid waste to Gaza and left hundreds of thousands of its people homeless and hungry.\nHowever, Israel decided to send a delegation to Cairo where indirect talks are due to start again within days.\nThe White House national security adviser, John Kirby, appeared optimistic on Tuesday, saying the US believed after looking at a text of the proposal put forward by mediators that it should be possible to close the gaps between the two sides.\nReports suggest the proposal Hamas agreed to does not include an immediate permanent end to hostilities but involves three consecutive phases, with different ratios for exchanges of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails for hostages, and a series of staged withdrawals of Israeli forces from zones in Gaza.\nFurther negotiations could take many days or even weeks, during which time fighting is likely to continue as both sides seek leverage in negotiations, analysts said.\nInternational powers including the US, Israel\u2019s staunchest ally, repeatedly warned Israel against a major military operation in Rafah, where more than 1 million people displaced from elsewhere in Gaza are sheltering. Aid agencies have predicted a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d.\nIsrael told the US its operation in Rafah was limited and designed to prevent weapons and funds from being smuggled into Gaza, Kirby said.\nAid officials in the territory said the flow of humanitarian assistance through the Rafah crossing had been entirely halted, leaving reserves of fuel only sufficient to run the extensive relief operation in Gaza for another day. Parts of Gaza are facing famine and everywhere there is acute hardship.\n\u201cWe are down to less fuel than in a single service station. It\u2019s enough to last a day, basically. After that, nothing will be moving, and the hospitals won\u2019t be able to keep going for more than two or three days,\u201d said Georgios Petropoulos, the head of the Gaza sub-office of UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nThe Kerem Shalom border post, another main access point for aid, was shut after a rocket barrage killed four Israeli soldiers there earlier this week. There were further rocket and mortar strikes against the same target on Tuesday, an Israeli military official said.\nThe Rafah crossing was the only exit point for those needing to leave Gaza for medical treatment that is no longer available in the territory.\nLama Abu Holi, eight, has been in al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza for a month, waiting for a chance to leave for treatment to her injured legs.\n\u201cToday my name was at the border, and I should travel to get my legs treated,\u201d she said, holding a toy in her hospital bed. \u201cThey hurt. I am supposed to have an operation. Because the border crossing is shut today, I could not travel. I am sad because I did not leave today.\u201d\nAn Israeli military official said the target of the operation in Rafah was \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d.\nThe Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes across the territory had killed 54 Palestinians and wounded 96 others in the past 24 hours.\nOn Sunday Israel\u2019s military told civilians in eastern neighbourhoods of Rafah to head for what it calls an \u201cexpanded humanitarian zone\u201d at al-Mawasi along the coast and around the largely deserted city of Khan Younis. Thousands have left Rafah since the warning, in battered trucks, pushing trolleys, on donkey carts and walking, but aid agencies said neither location could accommodate a new influx.\nA total of 34,789 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in the conflict, the Gaza health ministry said.\nThe October Hamas attacks killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians in their homes or at a music festival.\nThe Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s grip on power could slip if he loses support of far-right coalition allies who oppose any concessions to Hamas, but there is also pressure to free the remaining hostages.\n\u201cCapitulating to Hamas\u2019s demands would be a terrible defeat for the state of Israel. It would exhibit terrible weakness to our friends and to our enemies. This weakness would only bring closer the next war,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an umbrella group, said it had appealed to a number of countries to \u201cexert influence on the Israeli government\u201d and push for an agreement.\n\u201cAt this crucial moment, while a tangible opportunity for the release of the hostages is on the table, it is of the utmost importance that your government manifest its strong support for such an agreement,\u201d the group said in a message sent to the ambassadors of all countries with citizens among the hostages seized by Hamas.\n\u201cThis is the time to exert your influence on the Israeli government and all other parties concerned to ensure that the agreement comes through which will finally bring all our loved ones home.\u201d\nAbu Ubaida, a spokesperson for Hamas\u2019s armed wing, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, said in a statement on Tuesday that a 70-year-old Israeli hostage died after she succumbed to wounds from Israeli shelling. There was no independent confirmation of the claim.", "55024": "title: Israeli operation leaves Rafah's hospitals overwhelmed \n content: Even without a full-scale Israeli ground invasion, Rafah's medical facilities have been overwhelmed.\nMedics say more than a million people sheltering in the southern Gaza city are at risk of being deprived of healthcare after the Israeli military began a \"limited\" operation against Hamas on its eastern outskirts on Monday.\nThe largest of the city's three partially functioning hospitals, Abu Youssef al-Najjar, had to be hastily abandoned the following day after staff received an evacuation order and there was fighting nearby.\nThe hospital's dialysis department had been the only surviving one in Gaza, a lifeline for patients suffering kidney failure.\nThe Israeli advance has also cut off access to the nearby European Gaza Hospital in Khan Younis, where critical patients were being referred for surgery, as well as the nearby Rafah and Kerem Shalom border crossings.\nWith the Emirati maternity hospital in Rafah busy delivering dozens of babies each day, the Kuwaiti Specialist hospital is struggling to cope with a surge of emergency cases despite a lack of capacity, staff and equipment.\nOne doctor at the hospital, which before the war had only four intensive care beds, said the situation there was \"catastrophic in every sense of the word\".\n\"Unfortunately, the Kuwaiti hospital is a small hospital that does not have diagnostic capabilities,\" Dr Jamal al-Hams, its director, told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. \"Even the X-ray machine is disabled due to the Israeli shelling and there are no spare parts for it, as the crossings are closed.\"\n\"And the CBC analysis device has stopped due to being overloaded,\" he added, referring to the complete blood count test used to diagnose and monitor numerous diseases.\nDr Hams said he and his colleagues were nevertheless having to treat people with complex trauma wounds, burns, fractures and crushed limbs.\n\"We have received some cases of torn abdomen and intestines, and cases of skull fractures with parts of the brain outside the skull,\" he recalled. \"Some cases have lost major parts of the buttocks, in addition to cases of amputation of the lower limbs at the foot area.\n\"These are unusual injuries caused by unusual weapons. I lived through all previous wars [in Gaza]... where injuries were always in a certain area and dealt with by one specialist. But now each case needs several specialists.\"\nHe also expressed anger at how doctors at al-Najjar hospital had been forced to evacuate both the facility and their family homes at such short notice.\nThe Israeli military told all residents of a number of eastern areas of Rafah to leave for their own safety on Monday and head towards an \"expanded humanitarian area\" stretching from nearby al-Mawasi to the central town of Deir al-Balah, where it said there would be field hospitals, tents and aid.\n\"Where should they go? Tents and other supplies were supposed to be provided in other safe areas. This has not been done,\" Dr Hams said.\nDr Youssef Abu al-Rish, undersecretary of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, told Gaza Lifeline that Rafah's remaining medical facilities would no longer able to save the lives of many seriously wounded or ill patients.\n\"Rafah governorate does not have real medical services after the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital went out of service and people were unable to reach the European Gaza Hospital,\" he said.\n\"There are many field hospitals, but they cannot provide all these services as they do not have the necessary infrastructure or capabilities... For instance, they do not have dialysis services, oxygen-generating stations, intensive care departments or blood banks.\"\nHe added: \"The Kuwaiti Hospital is a small non-governmental hospital that cannot provide emergency services. But we are trying to enhance its capabilities.\"\nMedical aid group Project Hope said on Thursday that all of its clinics and mobile medical points in Rafah were closed, and that almost all of its staff had been evacuated, with many fleeing to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.\n\"Most aid services were based in Rafah. Now that people are further north, there is nearly no help. As long as the violence continues and the Rafah border crossing remains closed, more and more people will die from preventable causes,\" said Moses Kondowe, its Gaza team lead in Rafah.\nMr Kondowe said he expected to see malnutrition, pregnancy complications and other health conditions like Hepatitis A and cholera increase.\nHundreds of thousands of children sheltering in Rafah are already injured, sick, malnourished, traumatized or living with disabilities.\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said on Wednesday that its teams had begun to discharge patients from Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital, where they helped provide post-operative care, and had suspended activities at its clinic in al-Shaboura - a move it described as \"catastrophic\".\nThe medical group also said it was handing over its activities at the Emirati maternity hospital to the Gaza health ministry.\nDr Abu al-Rish said the closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which Israeli troops seized on Tuesday, meant patients who had been due to be sent abroad for medical treatment were now stranded.\nHaitham, a teenage boy who has already had three operations for a bullet wound that punctured his lung, is one of those waiting to leave.\n\"I feel helpless,\" he said. \"The world is powerless to open the border. The hospitals here can no longer help me.\"\nZeina, a nine-year-old girl who has epilepsy, was also scheduled to be transferred abroad by the end of this week.\n\"She went to the hospital for hepatitis and her liver function tests where very high and she fell into a coma,\" her mother told Gaza Lifeline.\n\"After 14 days, Zeina woke up and her nerve cells had been affected and she couldn't... walk or move or hold anything. Her hands were often shaking so they started giving her medication and then put her up for transfer.\"\nIsraeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Thursday night that its troops were continuing to operate against \"terror targets and the smuggling of weapons in the area of eastern Rafah\".\n\"This activity supports the intelligence we had [that] Hamas used the area of the Rafah Crossing for terrorism,\" he added.\n\"We found several terrorist tunnel shafts in the area, which we are currently investigating and scanning, and so far, our forces have eliminated approximately 50 terrorists in this area during encounters and air strikes, and also during scans in the area.\"\nThe Israeli military also said it had reopened the nearby Kerem Shalom goods crossing for humanitarian aid on Wednesday, but the UN has said the fighting has made it impossible for it to pick up supplies there.\nAnd unless they receive deliveries of fuel in the next few days, the World Health Organization has said all hospitals in Rafah and elsewhere in southern Gaza may soon have to halt services.", "55102": "title: UNICEF State of Palestine Humanitarian Situation Report No. 24 (Escalation): 18 April to 1 May 2024 \n content: Highlights\n\u00b7 The percentage of children identified with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in the south and middle areas of the Gaza Strip has been stable for the past weeks according to MUAC measure reports. In such fragile context, where the risk of famine is imminent, any progress could be reversed rapidly. Data for the north of the Strip is yet to be received.\nMore than 72 per cent of all schools in the Gaza Strip will either need full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again, as the Education Cluster evaluated in a satellite-based damage assessment.\nUNICEF provided 183,000 litres of fuel in the past two weeks, which allowed to produce lifesaving water for over 1.6 million people, including over 0.8 million children.\nUNICEF has moved 98 trucks into the Gaza Strip in the past two weeks with critical emergency supplies, including 6,800 cartons of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF); 305,280 packs of Ready-to-Use Infant Formula (RUIF); 10,000 cartons of high energy biscuits; 13,436 hygiene kits; 15,504 packs of sanitary pads; and 56,416 sets of children\u2019s clothes.\nIn the West Bank, UNICEF provided essential child protection services, including psychosocial first aid, MHPSS, and legal services to 679 people, including 470 children (321 girls) and 209 caregivers (180 women).\nSituation Overview & Humanitarian Needs\nAs per nutrition cluster estimates 50,400 children under five suffer from acute malnutrition (a dramatic increase from 7,685 children targeted in the initial Flash Appeal in November 2024). In addition to disease and lack of access to water and sanitation, affecting children\u2019s nutritional status, the overall picture of dietary diversity of children and pregnant and breastfeeding women especially in the North of the Gaza Strip remains extremely worrying, with only two per cent of children reaching the threshold for minimum dietary diversity. However, for the first time since early December 2023, a very slight improvement of the status of dietary diversity of both children under two and pregnant and breastfeeding women was detected through UNICEF\u2019s post distribution monitoring of cash transfers, with data essentially from Rafah (62 per cent) and Middle Gaza (24 per cent). In particular for children below the age of two, the number of respondents indicating 3, 4 and 5 food types2 have increased slightly (from 4 to 6 per cent, 1 to 3 per cent and 0 to 2 per cent respectively). For breastfeeding women, the respondents indicating two food types or more increased by 10 percentage points from 17 per cent in February to 27 per cent in mid-April 2024. Only 1 per cent of women declared five food groups or more, the threshold for minimum diversity for women. These results correlate well with UNICEF's data on the situation of markets indicating increased availability of goods. This improvement can potentially be attributed to the increased volume of goods entering the Gaza Strip, and to a better situation of markets in the south as compared to the north of the Gaza Strip.\nAs of 30 April, at least 34,535 Palestinians were reported killed in the Gaza Strip since the start of hostilities. Up to 70 per cent are reported to be women (9,100) and children (14,000) as reported by the Palestinian Ministry of Health. More than 77,704 Palestinians were reported injured, including at least 12,290 children (partially disaggregated data as of 28 April 2024). As of 20 April, 442 attacks on health care in Gaza were recorded, affecting 100 health facilities and 106 ambulances, according to reporting by WHO. More than 540,000 girls and women in Gaza are of reproductive age and need access to appropriate items to support hygiene, health, dignity, and well-being3 . As of the end of April, there were 254 aid workers killed including 180 UNRWA staff4 . Close to 1.7 million IDPs (over 75 per cent of the population) are sheltering at emergency shelters.\nThe latest satellite-based assessment exercise on damage to education facilities5 shows that, 86.1 per cent of schools (483 out of all 563 schools) sustained some level of damage to their buildings. 72.5 per cent of schools in Gaza will either need full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again. Almost 29 per cent of schools that were evaluated as either \u201cdirectly hit\u201d or \u201cdamaged\u201d are UN-run schools through UNRWA, while 65.3 per cent of school buildings that have been used by IDP as shelters were assessed as either \u201cdirectly hit\u201d or \u201cdamaged\u201d. Restrictions on the entry of education supplies, denial of fuel for education partners, and underfunding for education activities, continue to undermine aid organisations\u2019 capacities to respond. The absence of schooling in the Gaza Strip, continues to deprive 625,000 children of opportunities for their social, emotional, and cognitive development. Without sufficient aid, these children are at risk of permanently dropping out of school, rendering them vulnerable to exploitation, child labour, early marriage, and other forms of abuse.\nIn the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, OCHA reports that since 7 October, at least 474 Palestinians have been killed.6 At least 126 Palestinian children (including three girls) and two Israeli children were reported killed in conflict-related violence in the same time period, with more than 60 per cent of incidents in the northern West Bank. A militarized law enforcement operation in the Nur al-Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem between 18 and 21 April, resulted in heavy damage to residences and WASH infrastructure, as well as children killed, injured, and arrested.\nInitial assessments by the UN and child protection partners responding to mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) needs highlighted psychological distress among families and children, and increased needs for psychosocial support services due to exposure of children to violence during recurrent operations. As of 20 April, 446 attacks on health care in the West Bank including East Jerusalem were recorded, affecting 52 health facilities, 18 mobile clinics and 298 ambulances, according to reporting by WHO. According to OCHA, since 7 October, some 3,000 Palestinians including more than 1,300 children have been displaced, mainly in Area C and East Jerusalem, due to settler violence and access restrictions, home demolitions, and destruction of residences during military law enforcement operations.\nIsraeli authorities report that approximately 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed, mostly in the attacks of 7 October, and more than 7,500 people are reported injured. More than 35 children have been reported killed. Around 250 people, including at least 36 children were abducted from Israel into the Gaza Strip, of whom 34 have been released, with very limited information available on the children remaining in captivity.", "55125": "title: Ms. Joyce Msuya, Assistant-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Opening Remarks at the Ninth Conference on Effective Partnership for Better Humanitarian A \n content: AS DELIVERED\nHis Excellency Counselor Mr. Faisal Al-Ghurayeb, Minister of Justice and Minister of Endowments and Islamic Affairs; His Excellency Dr. Abdullah AlMatouq, President of the International Islamic Charitable Organisation and Special Advisor to the United Nations Secretary-General,\nExcellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,\nAsalaam aleikum. I am honoured to speak with you today and would like to thank the Government of Kuwait and the International Islamic Charitable Organisation for their steadfast support to people caught in crises worldwide.\nTheir leadership in convening this conference for the ninth time is a testament to their determination to reduce suffering around the world. And it comes at a critical time for the people of Gaza.\nThe war in Gaza has become a moral stain on the conscience of our collective humanity.\nAs we gather here today, the war in Gaza, now in its eighth month, has entered yet another horrifying phase.\nDespite repeated appeals, Israel moved ahead with its military offensive in Rafah and seized control of the Gaza side of the Rafah and Kerem Shalom border crossings earlier this week.\nAs warned, this has triggered new and more challenges. These crossings are a lifeline for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in need.\nThis spells further catastrophe for more than a million people who have been forcibly displaced to Rafah to escape fighting, disease and hunger elsewhere.\nEight months of fighting have turned Gaza into a hellscape for millions trapped under incessant bombardment.\nThe war has killed some 35,000 people; 70,000 more are wounded or missing, with many more trapped under the rubble.\nFor months, women and children have been killed at a rate that exceeds any war in this century.\nAnd those who\u2019ve escaped death and injury now risk losing their lives because of a lack of food, safe water, medicine and healthcare.\nEvery day, scores of women give birth in horrifying conditions, often without anesthesia or medical aid, as bombs explode around them. Mothers watch their babies die in their arms because they don\u2019t have enough milk to keep them alive. And children are dying because they don\u2019t have enough food or water.\nWhat aid makes it into Gaza is being delivered by humanitarian workers who are forced to navigate checkpoints, unexploded bombs, lawlessness and intense fighting \u2013 at tremendous risk to their own lives.\nThe courage of the frontline responders as they risk everything to reduce the suffering is astonishing. Doctors are refusing to abandon patients, putting their lives on the line as medical facilities are attacked. And humanitarian workers continue to work for others even as they flee their own homes.\nFor our part, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \u2013 or OCHA \u2013 continues to do everything it can.\nWe are in daily access negotiations with the parties. We are coordinating the humanitarian response. We are supporting the humanitarian community. We are advocating for the protection of civilians and respect for the laws of war at the highest level. We have pulled people out of the rubble and repatriated the bodies of aid workers, including those working for World Central Kitchen and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res who were killed serving those in need.\nOCHA also works on behalf of dozens of UN agencies and NGOs to share the coordinates of humanitarian convoys and premises so that the warring sides will not harm them. And we continue to lead humanitarian missions to northern Gaza.\nWe have also worked since the beginning of the conflict to continually assess the needs of the Palestinian people, which is why we\u2019re appealing for $2.8 billion to support more than three million people in Gaza and the West Bank over the next eight months.\nThis war \u2013 which has caused such pain, suffering and grief \u2013 must end so that the Palestinian people can begin to confront the trauma inflicted on them.\nI echo the Secretary-General\u2019s longstanding call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, and the immediate and unconditional release of hostages.\nEven in the absence of a ceasefire, there is still much we can do given the right conditions. The UN and our partners, many of whom are in this room today, deliver aid in conflict zones around the world. Gaza should be no different.\nTo reach people in need, we need multiple, reliable entry points for aid. We need law and order. And humanitarian workers must be protected, and not attacked.\nUntil we have safe routes, the flow of aid simply will not match the enormous scale of the catastrophe.\nWe also need Israeli authorities to abide by their obligations to facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid and humanitarian workers. This includes for UNRWA, which has been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza for decades and is best positioned to respond to the dire needs of the Palestinian people.\nHere, allow me to salute the Government of Kuwait, which, along with other important partners, came to the support of UNRWA financially and diplomatically, allowing UNRWA to continue its critical role.\nDespite the immense challenges, we have strengthened our partnerships with local organizations, working hand-in-hand with our Palestinian partners to support those in need.\nThis has been particularly crucial when it comes to organizations led by Palestinian women working on the frontline. These organizations have access that others simply do not. We must do everything in our power to continue to support their heroic efforts to reach Gaza\u2019s women and girls, who have been forced to bear the war\u2019s very worst horrors.\nWhen I think about what effective humanitarian partnerships are built on, I think of the shared values that define and unite the humanitarian community \u2013 our impartiality, our neutrality and our independence, even in the most politicized conflicts.\nAnd I think of how these values emerge from a shared acknowledgment of our common humanity, a recognition that those most vulnerable to the depravities of war \u2013 the women, children, elderly and those with disabilities \u2013 must remain our focus.\nSo, as we gather here today, let us recall these shared values and recognize their importance \u2013 not only in meeting the urgency of today\u2019s growing needs, but also in building and strengthening the partnerships that will be needed to rebuild Gaza once the war ends.\nThere is complex and fraught work ahead of us. But if we can hold onto the values that unite us as humanitarians, then I know we will navigate these difficulties the best we can, in ways that ensure we continue to reach people whose lives have been shattered by a war of unimaginable horror.\nI once again would like to extend my deepest appreciation to our hosts \u2013 the Government of Kuwait and the International Islamic Charitable Organisation \u2013 for bringing us together in this crucial moment for humanity.\nThank you.", "55128": "title: Ms. Joyce Msuya, Assistant-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator -Opening Remarks at the Ninth Conference on Effective Partnership for Better Humanitarian \n content: AS DELIVERED\nHis Excellency Counselor Mr. Faisal Al-Ghurayeb, Minister of Justice and Minister of Endowments and Islamic Affairs; His Excellency Dr. Abdullah AlMatouq, President of the International Islamic Charitable Organisation and Special Advisor to the United Nations Secretary-General,\nExcellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,\nAsalaam aleikum.

And we continue to lead humanitarian missions to northern Gaza.\nWe have also worked since the beginning of the conflict to continually assess the needs of the Palestinian people, which is why we\u2019re appealing for $2.8 billion to support more than three million people in Gaza and the West Bank over the next eight months.\nThis war \u2013 which has caused such pain, suffering and grief \u2013 must end so that the Palestinian people can begin to confront the trauma inflicted on them.\nI echo the Secretary-General\u2019s longstanding call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, and the immediate and unconditional release of hostages.\nEven in the absence of a ceasefire, there is still much we can do given the right conditions. The UN and our partners, many of whom are in this room today, deliver aid in conflict zones around the world. Gaza should be no different.\nTo reach people in need, we need multiple, reliable entry points for aid. We need law and order. And humanitarian workers must be protected, and not attacked.\nUntil we have safe routes, the flow of aid simply will not match the enormous scale of the catastrophe.\nWe also need Israeli authorities to abide by their obligations to facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid and humanitarian workers. This includes for UNRWA, which has been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza for decades and is best positioned to respond to the dire needs of the Palestinian people.\nHere, allow me to salute the Government of Kuwait, which, along with other important partners, came to the support of UNRWA financially and diplomatically, allowing UNRWA to continue its critical role.\nDespite the immense challenges, we have strengthened our partnerships with local organizations, working hand-in-hand with our Palestinian partners to support those in need.\nThis has been particularly crucial when it comes to organizations led by Palestinian women working on the frontline. These organizations have access that others simply do not. We must do everything in our power to continue to support their heroic efforts to reach Gaza\u2019s women and girls, who have been forced to bear the war\u2019s very worst horrors.\nWhen I think about what effective humanitarian partnerships are built on, I think of the shared values that define and unite the humanitarian community \u2013 our impartiality, our neutrality and our independence, even in the most politicized conflicts.\nAnd I think of how these values emerge from a shared acknowledgment of our common humanity, a recognition that those most vulnerable to the depravities of war \u2013 the women, children, elderly and those with disabilities \u2013 must remain our focus.\nSo, as we gather here today, let us recall these shared values and recognize their importance \u2013 not only in meeting the urgency of today\u2019s growing needs, but also in building and strengthening the partnerships that will be needed to rebuild Gaza once the war ends.\nThere is complex and fraught work ahead of us. But if we can hold onto the values that unite us as humanitarians, then I know we will navigate these difficulties the best we can, in ways that ensure we continue to reach people whose lives have been shattered by a war of unimaginable horror.\nI once again would like to extend my deepest appreciation to our hosts \u2013 the Government of Kuwait and the International Islamic Charitable Organisation \u2013 for bringing us together in this crucial moment for humanity.\nThank you.", "55255": "title: Opinion: Netanyahu and his extremist allies are endangering Israel\u2019s long-term security \n content: Editor\u2019s Note: Richard J. Davis was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Carter administration and former assistant Watergate special prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\nCNN \u2014\nPresident Joe Biden appropriately spoke out forcefully about the need to combat the surge in antisemitism in the US, the importance of supporting Israel\u2019s security and not forgetting the brutality of the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas during his speech at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the Capitol on Tuesday.\n\u201cMy commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree,\u201d he said.\nRichard J. Davis Courtesy Richard Davis\nBut if we are to fight against antisemitism, promote the long-term security of Israel and remember the horrors of the October 7 Hamas attack we must also recognize and speak out against a dangerous failure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.\nThat failure is his inability to understand one of the basic requirements to establish long-term security for any society: those living there need to believe they have a stake in that society and can enjoy its benefits. If they do, they will want it to be as safe and secure as possible. If, however, many believe that they have no stake in a society and that they have no real hope of sharing in its success, then turning to violence to create a place in which they believe they can meaningfully participate is far more likely.\nIf Netanyahu understood this principle, his government would not include dangerous extremists and would not pursue policies involving the significant expansion of West Bank settlements and the recognition of illegal settlements which deny Palestinians hope for a better future. We also would not have to deal with the reality that efforts to support the long-term security of Israel, combat the scourge of antisemitism and address Gaza protests on campuses both in the US and abroad have been made more difficult by the extremism of the Netanyahu government.\nNetanyahu, an outspoken critic of the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords, has spent his years as prime minister promoting the expansion of settlements within the West Bank and making it clear that Palestinians have no hope of anything like their own state.\nAccording to the New York Times, he even went so far as to voice no objection to various Arab countries providing aid to Hamas as part of demonstrating that Israel had no realistic negotiating partner. But he reached a new low when in 2022 he brought into his government the most extreme anti-Palestinian participants in Israeli politics. Their inclusion sent the clear message to Palestinians that there is no hope of a better future for them in any Israeli-controlled-land.\nNetanyahu invited Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir to join his government. The former was appointed finance minister and was given responsibility for West Bank settlements. He has, however, suggested during a debate on an immigration bill it was a mistake in 1948 not to expel all Arabs from Israel; has asserted that \u201cthere is no such thing as a Palestinian people;\u201d favors all of the West Bank being incorporated into Israel; and says he supports the voluntary moving of Palestinians out of Gaza.\nBen Gvir, who has been given a national security portfolio, is arguably even worse. He has been convicted of inciting racism against Arabs and was an alleged member of a terrorist group; has idolized the killing of Palestinians; publicly threatened then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin before his assassination in 1995; and claimed that his right to travel in the West Bank was more important than the Palestinians\u2019 right to travel. And, just late last month he reportedly questioned the Israeli Defense Forces why they were taking so many Palestinian prisoners instead of killing them (which would be a violation of international law).\nAfter the October 7 terrorist attack, Netanyahu had an opportunity to remove Smotrich and Ben Gvir from their posts when the first offer from the opposition for a unity government involved their elimination from the cabinet. Seemingly focused on not disturbing his coalition and staying in power, Netanyahu refused. Consequently, his unity government today still gives a platform to these extremists. It also gives license to followers of these extremists to, as we have seen, attack Palestinians in the West Bank and even to attack a Jordanian aid convoy.\nThere is no doubt that a robust military response by Israel was justified. And there also is no doubt that Hamas\u2019 embedding its fighters and military infrastructure within the civilian population has inevitably increased the dangers civilians face in Gaza. But as has been widely reported, the military tactics adopted by Netanyahu\u2019s government have led to massive civilian casualties, including of international aid workers. Its approach to assistance to Gaza has led to a historic humanitarian crisis.\nAt the same time, Israel has continued with significant expansion of settlements on the West Bank. The message being sent is clear. As far as the Netanyahu administration is concerned, Palestinian lives do not matter, and there is no reason for them to expect a better future. As a result, however much Hamas is weakened, a new generation of terrorists is being created. And the brutality of the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas and the plight of the hostages are being drowned out.\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nSo what should those organizations and individuals who believe in Israel and the need to fight antisemitism, whether it be on college campuses or elsewhere, do? For their own efforts to be credible they must not avoid legitimate criticism of Israel. They must condemn the participation of Smotrich and Ben Gvir in the Israeli government. They need, as the United States government is doing, to tell Israel there can be no more excuses. Israel must do what is necessary to expand and simplify the process of sending humanitarian aid to Gaza. They also need to be clear that Israel must change its military tactics to dramatically reduce civilian deaths. And, as challenging as it would be, they need to openly call for the end to the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and for a path back towards a two-state solution.\nIgnoring the extremism of the Netanyahu government and the horrible humanitarian disaster in Gaza only undermines the credibility of those seeking to defend Israel and fight antisemitism. Indeed, Netanyahu\u2019s government and its actions risk adding fuel to the dangerous fire of antisemitism. And tragically, for all too many around the world, revulsion over what his government has become risks causing them to no longer support the legitimacy of Israel itself.", "55791": "title: Israel tells 100,000 Palestinians to evacuate Rafah ahead of ground invasion \n content: For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Families in Rafah told The Independent there was a state of panic after the evacuation orders and that Al-Mawasi was \u201cnot a liveable place\u201d and also not safe.\n\u201cIn accordance with the approval of the political echelon, the IDF is calling on the population, which is under the control of Hamas, to temporarily evacuate from the eastern neighbourhoods of Rafah to the expanded humanitarian space,\u201d a statement from the IDF said on Monday.\nIt said that it was contacting Palestinians through \u201cannouncements, text messages, phone calls and media broadcasts in Arabic\u201d.\nThe army has begun dropping red and blue flyers that warn those sheltering in the Rafah Camp, the Brazil Camp and the neighbourhood of Al-Shabura to evacuate immediately.\nThe translated message from Arabic on the flyers reads: \u201cRemaining in these areas puts your lives in danger.\u201d\n\u201cThe IDF is about to operate with force against the terror organizations in the area you currently reside, as the IDF has operated so far,\u201d it added.\nPalestinians inspect the destruction following overnight Israeli strikes on Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on 6 May ( AFP via Getty Images )\nThe evacuation notices came as prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to walk away from ceasefire talks that are due to continue through to Tuesday, after refusing to agree to Hamas\u2019s demands to withdraw Israeli forces from Gaza.\nFamilies in Rafah who have already been displaced multiple times said people were panicking as they had no where to go. Nedal Hamdouna, who is twice displaced from North Gaza and is in the living in a tent with his extended family, said it was not possible for people to live in al-Mawasi. The tiny patch of coastal land that the Israeli military identified as the \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d is mostly sand dunes and packed with displaced people.\n\u201cAl-Mawasi is not a liveable place,\u201d he told The Independent in desperation. \u201cBefore the war it was just empty beach land there is no infrastructure. We have had discussions about trying to move elsewhere but there is nowhere that is safe and liveable, with no water it\u2019s all destroyed.\u201d\n\u201cThe question everyone is asking is where do we go? Al Mawasi is not big enough, and it\u2019s already full. Hundreds of thousands of people are already living there, there are thousands of tents with no space between them. Also how do people get there?\n\u201cEveryone is worried and scared,\u201d Nedal added.\nPiling pressure on the misery were overnight air strikes on east Rafah which killed multiple people and the temporary closure of the land crossing to Kerem Shalom, which saw food prices in Rafah double overnight. Palestinian health officials said at least 19 people were killed by Israeli fire.UN officials told The Independent an Israeli military operation into Rafah, which is sheltering to 1.4 million people, most of them already displaced and half of them children, could \"lead to a bloodbath.\"\nTamara al-Rifae, from the UN's Palestinian Refugee Agency UNRWA, told The Independent the potential impact from the assault would be \"catastrophic\".\n\"No amount of emergency planning can assuage the immense anxiety than most people in Rafah feel today, as news of an imminent incursion abound,\" she said, adding that UNRWA has pledged to stay put in the border town and continue humanitarian operations.\n\"The potential impact of such a military operation is catastrophic, given the level, scope and scale of the destruction that Gazans have already witnessed across the Strip for the last 7 months,\" she continued.\n\"An immediate humanitarian ceasefire is the only way to prevent more death and destruction.\"\nLouise Wateridge, who also works for UNRWA and spoke to The Independent from inside Rafah, said that there had been a lot of hope of ceasefire coming over the last few days, but that had turned to \u201chuge fear and concern\u201d about safety as Israel\u2019s Rafah assault looked imminent.\n\u201cEvery person I\u2019ve spoke to here has conveyed to me how scared they are of what is next,\u201d she told The Independent from the border town in Gaza.\n\u201cEverybody is asking where do we go and what are they going to find? Even in Rafah there is not infrastructure despite having humanitarian operations based her and on the ground here for months because there are so many people in such a small place.\u201d\nShe said a recent heatwave in Rafah actually killed people who were sheltering in plastic tents which provide no shelter. \u201cThis looming threat of additional displacement really threatens to push the community past its breaking point. It\u2019s exasperating already dire living conditions and placing hundreds of 1000s of people at increased risk.\u201d\nDefence minister Yoav Gallant said on Monday that Israeli military action was required in Rafah due to Hamas\u2019s refusal to mediate proposals for a truce and release Israeli hostages.\nMr Netanyahu has been unrelenting in his plans to invade Rafah despite warnings that it will lead to massive casualties among the civilians sheltering there. Israel has faced calls from both world leaders and humanitarian agencies to call off its assault.\nRafah sits at the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt at the far south of the Hamas-controlled enclave, and has become increasingly overcrowded with up to a million Palestinians sheltering there from the Israeli offensive to the north.\nRelatives of Palestinians killed during an Israeli air strike mourn next to their wrapped bodies outside Al-Najjar Hospital ( EPA )\nThe Israeli army describes Rafah as the last stronghold for Hamas and claims that between 5,000 to 8,000 of its fighters and senior leaders are holed up in the city.\nOn Sunday three Israeli soldiers were killed after Hamas militants carried out a deadly rocket attack from the Kerem Shalom crossing in Rafah.\nThe IDF claimed that 10 projectiles were fired from a part of Rafah crossing in southern Gaza, about 3.6km (2.2 miles) from a major crossing used for the delivery of aid.

These crossings are a lifeline for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestinians in need.\nThis spells further catastrophe for more than a million people who have been forcibly displaced to Rafah to escape fighting, disease and hunger elsewhere.\nSeven months of fighting have turned Gaza into a hellscape for millions trapped under incessant bombardment.\nThe war has killed some 35,000 people; 70,000 more are wounded or missing, with many more trapped under the rubble.\nFor months, women and children have been killed at a rate that exceeds any war in this century.\nAnd those who\u2019ve escaped death and injury now risk losing their lives because of a lack of food, safe water, medicine and healthcare.\nEvery day, scores of women give birth in horrifying conditions, often without anesthesia or medical aid, as bombs explode around them. Mothers watch their babies die in their arms because they don\u2019t have enough milk to keep them alive.

Mothers watch their babies die in their arms because they don\u2019t have enough milk to keep them alive. And children are dying because they don\u2019t have enough food or water.\nWhat aid makes it into Gaza is being delivered by humanitarian workers who are forced to navigate checkpoints, unexploded bombs, lawlessness and intense fighting \u2013 at tremendous risk to their own lives.\nThe courage of the frontline responders as they risk everything to reduce the suffering is astonishing. Doctors are refusing to abandon patients, putting their lives on the line as medical facilities are attacked. And humanitarian workers continue to work for others even as they flee their own homes.\nFor our part, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \u2013 or OCHA \u2013 continues to do everything it can.\nWe are in daily access negotiations with the parties. We are coordinating the humanitarian response. We are supporting the humanitarian community. We are advocating for the protection of civilians and respect for the laws of war at the highest level. We have pulled people out of the rubble and repatriated the bodies of aid workers, including those working for World Central Kitchen and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res who were killed serving those in need.\nOCHA also works on behalf of dozens of UN agencies and NGOs to share the coordinates of humanitarian convoys and premises so that the warring sides will not harm them. And we continue to lead humanitarian missions to northern Gaza.\nWe have also worked since the beginning of the conflict to continually assess the needs of the Palestinian people, which is why we\u2019re appealing for US$2.8 billion to support more than three million people in Gaza and the West Bank over the next eight months.\nThis war \u2013 which has caused such pain, suffering and grief \u2013 must end so that the Palestinian people can begin to confront the trauma inflicted on them.\nI echo the Secretary-General\u2019s longstanding call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, and the immediate and unconditional release of hostages.\nEven in the absence of a ceasefire, there is still much we can do given the right conditions. The UN and our partners, many of whom are in this room today, deliver aid in conflict zones around the world. Gaza should be no different.\nTo reach people in need, we need multiple, reliable entry points for aid. We need law and order. And humanitarian workers must be protected, and not attacked.\nUntil we have safe routes, the flow of aid simply will not match the enormous scale of the catastrophe.\nWe also need Israeli authorities to abide by their obligations to facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid and humanitarian workers. This includes for UNRWA, which has been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza for decades and is best positioned to respond to the dire needs of the Palestinian people.\nHere, allow me to salute the Government of Kuwait, which, along with other important partners, came to the support of UNRWA financially and diplomatically, allowing UNRWA to continue its critical role.\nDespite the immense challenges, we have strengthened our partnerships with local organizations, working hand-in-hand with our Palestinian partners to support those in need.\nThis has been particularly crucial when it comes to organizations led by Palestinian women working on the frontline. These organizations have access that others simply do not. We must do everything in our power to continue to support their heroic efforts to reach Gaza\u2019s women and girls, who have been forced to bear the war\u2019s very worst horrors.\nWhen I think about what effective humanitarian partnerships are built on, I think of the shared values that define and unite the humanitarian community \u2013 our impartiality, our neutrality and our independence, even in the most politicized conflicts.\nAnd I think of how these values emerge from a shared acknowledgment of our common humanity, a recognition that those most vulnerable to the depravities of war \u2013 the women, children, elderly and those with disabilities \u2013 must remain our focus.\nSo, as we gather here today, let us recall these shared values and recognize their importance \u2013 not only in meeting the urgency of today\u2019s growing needs, but also in building and strengthening the partnerships that will be needed to rebuild Gaza once the war ends.\nThere is complex and fraught work ahead of us. But if we can hold onto the values that unite us as humanitarians, then I know we will navigate these difficulties the best we can, in ways that ensure we continue to reach people whose lives have been shattered by a war of unimaginable horror.\nI once again would like to extend my deepest appreciation to our hosts \u2013 the Government of Kuwait and the International Islamic Charitable Organisation \u2013 for bringing us together in this crucial moment for humanity.\nThank you.", "56409": "title: Rafah\u2019s hospitals overwhelmed while food and fuel run out as Israel steps up bombardment \n content: For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The World Food Programme will run out of food for distribution in southern Gaza by Saturday and there are no tents, blankets or bedding to set up new locations for displaced people, said Georgios Petropoulos, an official with the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Rafah.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) told The Independent there could be just three days of fuel left to power hospitals, water supplies and sanitation. This could see hospitals shut down critical operations and bring to a halt trucks delivering aid across south and central Gaza.\nThe UN and other agencies have warned for weeks that an Israeli assault on Rafah \u2013 on the border with Egypt near the main aid entry points \u2013 would cripple humanitarian operations and lead to a \u201cbloodbath\u201d. More than 1.4 million Palestinians \u2013 half of Gaza's population \u2013 are sheltering in Rafah, most of them displaced multiple times from other parts of the strip. Israel has defended its offensive, despite facing global pressure to stand down, saying it is \u201cvital\u201d in its battle to eliminate Hamas.\nThe Israeli military said Kerem Shalom crossing was open from its side and that 200,000 litres of fuel were allowed to cross on Friday. But the UN said it was too dangerous for workers to reach the crossing on the Gaza side to retrieve the aid due to Israel\u2019s incursion and the ensuing fighting with Hamas.\nDr Richard Brennan, of the WHO, said the fighting is crippling the healthcare system, and the response to a humanitarian crisis that in many ways is the \u201cworst we have ever seen\u201d.\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe, and there is a massive degradation in the hospitals,\u201d he told The Independent.\nVolunteers from the World Central Kitchen cook meals to be distributed to needy Palestinians in Rafah ( AFP via Getty Images )\nOnly a third of Gaza\u2019s hospitals and primary healthcare facilities are still operational. In Rafah only two are working \u2013 and they are at 250 per cent bed capacity .\n\u201cThe main hospital, Al-Najjar, which became a major referral centre, is now closed because it is not accessible and in the path of the fighting,\u201d said Dr Brennan.\n\u201cIt was the main hospital providing dialysis for patients \u2013 and had several hundred kidney patients relying it.\u201d\nDr Marwan al-Hams, director of Al-Najjar hospital, said they had to evacuate the facility when they found out it was located in the middle of Israel\u2019s \u201cred zone and combat zone\u201d.\nHe said the sick, wounded and displaced people sheltering there \u201cpanicked\u201d \u2013 among those who had to be evacuated were renal-failure dialysis patients who were moved under bombardment.\n\u201cWe have set up a field hospital in the city centre,\u201d he told The Independent while on the move.\nAnother emergency doctor, who asked not to be named for security reasons, at the European Gaza Hospital, north of Rafah, said they were dealing with absolute \u201ccarnage\u201d amid a steady flow of blast victims.\n\u201cThe most distressing thing has been seeing little toddlers with massive head wounds, with skull fractures, who are absolutely distraught and distressed with the pain and suffering,\u201d he added in a voice note to The Independent.\n\u201cThey have sheer fear in their eyes from what they've been exposed to.\u201d\nDisplaced Palestinians arrive in central Gaza after fleeing from the southern Gaza city of Rafah ( AP )\nThe residents of Rafah are bracing themselves for a long-promised full-scale Israeli assault of the border town which was, for so long, known as the last refuge in Gaza.\nIsrael has launched a ferocious bombardment of Gaza and a siege in retaliation for Hamas\u2019s bloody rampage on south Israel on 7 October \u2013 an attack during which around 1,200 people were killed and another 250 taken hostage, including children.\nSince then, Palestinian health officials say Israel\u2019s bombings have killed nearly 35,000 people, the vast majority women and children. Restrictions on aid, and the security situation has led to a manmade famine, the UN has warned, with Dr Brennan saying that potentially a quarter of all children in Gaza aged between six months to five years are experiencing acute malnutrition.\nThere are concerns hunger will only increase after Israeli troops captured the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Tuesday, forcing it to shut down. Rafah was the main point of entry for fuel and supplies.\nHamish Young, the senior emergency coordinator in Gaza for the UN\u2019s child agency Unicef, said they were \u201cscraping the bottom of the barrel\u201d for supplies.\n\u201cFor five days, no fuel and virtually no humanitarian aid entered the Gaza Strip,\u201d he added.\nThe WHO\u2019s Dr Brennan said that in three decades of manning humanitarian responses he had not seen a displacement crisis like that currently in Gaza.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working in this field 31 years \u2013 I can tell you every one of the toughest and most experienced veterans who have stepped foot into Gaza say there are aspects of this crisis that are the worst they have ever seen,\u201d he added.\nThe UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said more than 110,000 people have fled Rafah.\nSome have erected new tents camps in the city of Khan Younis \u2013 which was half-destroyed in an earlier Israeli offensive \u2013 and the town of Deir al-Balah, where aid agencies said they had also been overwhelmed by the influx of wounded and displaced.\nThose who are still in Rafah told The Independent they \u201cdo not know where to run\u201d.\n\u201cThey do not know if they should move from the west or middle area of Rafah. The areas that were not identified as safe or dangerous places, there is no space to pitch tents,\u201d Ahmed said.\nIsrael\u2019s closest ally and biggest supplier of weapons, the US, has withheld some weapons deliveries as the Biden administration says it cannot support a major Rafah invasion in the absence of what it would deem a credible plan to safeguard non-combatants.\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to push ahead with the controversial ground assault with or without US arms, saying \u201cwe will fight with our fingernails\u201d if needed in a defiant statement late on Thursday. He maintains that victory in the seven-month-old conflict is impossible without taking Rafah.\nIn an interview on the Dr Phil Primetime show on Thursday, Mr Netanayhu said he hoped he and Joe Biden could overcome their disagreements over the Gaza war. \u201cWe often had our agreements but we\u2019ve had our disagreements. We've been able to overcome them,\u201d he added.", "56798": "title: Nations Unies \n content: United Nations\n\nNations Unies\n\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\nMS.

Remaining in these areas puts your lives in danger.\u201d\nIbrahim Nabil, a Palestinian volunteering at a hospital in Rafah, said the Israeli army told all residents that the western corridor of Gaza is the only \u201csafe\u201d area.\nHe added that Palestinians may also be able to flee to nearby districts such as Nuseirat, Deir el-Balah, Maghazi and az-Zawayda.\nWhat is al-Mawasi?\nAl-Mawasi is on the western coast of the Gaza Strip, running the length of Rafah and Khan Younis. According to aid agencies, it lacks the infrastructure needed for an influx of people and is not any safer than other areas.\nThe IDF has expanded the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi to accommodate the increased levels of aid flowing into Gaza. This expanded humanitarian area includes field hospitals, tents and increased amounts of food, water, medication and additional supplies. In accordance with the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/si47k9FCCz \u2014 Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) May 6, 2024\n\u201cAl Mawasi has been designated a so-called \u2018safe humanitarian zone\u2019 but it is not safe,\u201d Islamic Relief said in a statement.\n\u201cCivilians sheltering there say they continue to face attacks and severe shortages of food, water and other vital aid.

He said it was a factor in some places which he was not surprised by.\nOn Tuesday Rachel Reeves became the latest senior figure to acknowledge the difficulty posed by Labour\u2019s stance on the conflict, saying she \u201cregrets whenever someone decides that they cannot bring themselves to vote for the Labour Party\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cAnybody who sees the scenes unfolding on our television screens, including this weekend in Rafah and people being displaced multiple times but also people that have seen the taking of hostages at a music festival in Israel can\u2019t be help but be moved by those scenes.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have called for an immediate ceasefire to allow aid into Gaza unimpeded, but also the release of hostages that are still in underground tunnels in Gaza. They must be freed as well. Now, I recognise that there are some people who didn\u2019t vote for Labour last week because they did have concerns.\u201d\nBut left-wing campaign group Momentum called on Labour to do more to pressure Rishi Sunak and foreign secretary Lord Cameron into suspending arms sales to Israel. As Israel launched an attack on the southern city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip, a spokesman for the group said: \u201cPlainly, Israel is acting like a rogue state - the UK Government must now suspend arms sales to prevent further UK complicity, and Labour should be pressuring Sunak and Cameron accordingly.\u201d\nLabour lost its majority of 13 years in Oldham, which had already been whittled down due to defections last month over the party\u2019s approach on Gaza. And sources from Labour\u2019s West Midlands team have claimed some Muslim voters stayed home, while many backed independent pro-Gaza candidate Akhmed Yakoob.\nMCB secretary general Zara Mohammed said: \u201cThe dissatisfaction with politicians is palpable, and the response to the atrocities in Gaza is only the tip of the iceberg.\nLabour\u2019s West Midlands mayor Richard Parker narrowly beat Conservative incumbent Andy Street, with independent pro-Palestine candidate Akhmed Yakoob hoovering up votes ( Getty Images )\n\u201cThese election results are a wake-up call to all parties: every vote counts. Politicians can\u2019t take anyone for granted, especially not British Muslims.\u201d\nA key demand of The Muslim Vote is for Sir Keir to apologise for \u201cgreenlighting a genocide\u201d and for not supporting an SNP-led ceasefire vote last November.\nThe demand relates to Sir Keir\u2019s apparent initial support for Israel withholding humanitarian aid from Gaza.\nAsked on LBC on October 11 if cutting off power and water was an appropriate response, Sir Keir replied: \"I think that Israel does have that right. It is an ongoing situation.\n\"Obviously everything should be done within international law, but I don\u2019t want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself and Hamas bears responsibility for the terrorist acts.\"\nBut he later rowed back the remarks amid concerns within the party that it has angered voters, particularly those in Muslim communities.\nDespite his attempts to clarify the remarks, the clip of Sir Keir on LBC is still widely shared by those attacking the party\u2019s approach to the Middle East.\nOther demands include a promise to sanction companies operating in occupied Palestinian territories, place a travel ban on Israeli politicians who have \u201cprosecuted this war\u201d and to ensure insurance quotes are not higher for people named Muhammad.\nThe Muslim Vote group describes itself as a broad collective with the support of a \u201chuge portion\u201d of the Muslim community. It is supported by 24 groups, including some which Michael Gove has said in parliament might fall foul of his department\u2019s new definition of extremism.\nGroups he named that \u201cgive rise to concern for their Islamist orientation and views\u201d were Muslim Engagement and Development (Mend) and the Muslim Association of Britain.\nBoth groups, which back The Muslim Vote, have rejected Mr Gove\u2019s characterisation.\nIts website displays a list of all the constituencies with at least 10 per cent Muslim voters, which lets users see how they have voted on past ceasefire motions.\nIt is then planning to add an advisory name in each seat of who supporters should vote for, who it says will be backed by local civil society organisations.\nThe seats which look the most perilous belong to Birmingham Ladywood MP Shabana Mahmood, who it says abstained on the vote, as well as Bethan Green and Stepney\u2019s Rushanara Ali. Both have more than 40 per cent Muslim electorates.\nBut the group appears to ignore a ceasefire motion passed by the Labour Party on a chaotic night in the House of Commons in February.\nThe group\u2019s website states: \u201cMuslims and all people who stand for justice agree that the current political class does not represent us. Peacefully, politically, and persistently we will vote them out.\u201d\nRegarding its demands, it said: \u201cThere is more but that\u2019ll do for starters. Our asks are sophisticated and we\u2019ve built consensus around them.\u201d\nLabour was asked to comment.\nThe Muslim Vote\u2019s list of demands is below:\n1. Apologise for your comments greenlighting a genocide and for not backing the ceasefire in Oct/Nov 2023\n2. Sanctions on companies operating in occupied territories. Sanctions on settlers\n3. Recognise Palestine as a state\n4. Travel ban on all Israeli politicians that prosecuted this war and support the illegal occupation\n5. End military ties with Israel\n6. Issue guidance that Muslims are allowed to pray at school\n7. Implement findings of people\u2019s review of Prevent \u2014 not Shawcross\n8. Remove the extremism definition that [Michael] Gove introduced\n9. Commit to full implementation of Royal Charter re media regulation\n10. Adopt the APPG definition of Islamophobia\n11. Commit to a review of public sector equality duty\n12. Increase council and public health funding for the 10 per cent most deprived areas in the country to finally address systemic and chronic health inequities as detailed in the Marmot Review and revisited by the Health Foundation 10 years later\n13. Deliver alternative student finance\n14. Ensure Sharia-compliant pensions are available at every workplace, so the one-third of Muslims without a pension get one\n15. Ensure insurance quotes don\u2019t cost more for someone called \u201cMuhammad\u201d\n16. Commit 7 per cent of the local government pension scheme/public sector pensions to ethical and Islamic funds\n17. Oppose Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) bill. Kick it out of law\n18.

If we need to, we will fight with our fingernails. But we have much more than fingernails,\u201d Netanyahu said. He noted that Israel was approaching the 76th anniversary of its independence, which it had to fight for. \u201cWe did not have weapons,\u201d he said, referring to the 1948 war. \u201cThere was an arms embargo on Israel, but with great strength of spirit, heroism and unity among us \u2013 we were victorious.\u201d\nUS officials had been hopeful that a diplomatic breakthrough could be achieved in hostages-for-ceasefire negotiations, following a Hamas announcement on Monday that it had accepted a deal. It was unclear what specific terms it had accepted, and Israel, though sceptical, agreed to send a delegation to Cairo to find out.\nAn unnamed senior Israeli official was quoted by Reuters on Thursday as saying that the Israeli delegation laid out its reservations to the Hamas position, and deemed the round of Cairo talks to have ended.\nThe official said the Israeli delegation was returning from the Egyptian capital and Israel would proceed with its operation in Rafah and other parts of the Gaza Strip as planned.\nThe White House confirmed that the CIA director, William Burns, was also leaving Cairo, but denied that the negotiations had broken down.\n\u201cBurns is departing the region as previously scheduled, but interlocutors from other delegations are still in discussions in Cairo, so those talks are still going on,\u201d John Kirby, the national security spokesperson, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay engaged, in the hopes that we might be able to land something.\u201d\nUS officials however were privately pessimistic about being able to prevent an offensive into Rafah, which Biden said on Thursday would trigger more restrictions on the US arms supply, specifically regarding bombs and artillery shells.\nLast week, the administration paused the delivery of 1,800 2,000lb bombs and 1,700 500lb bombs in an indication it is prepared to take action to stop a Rafah offensive.\nThe chief IDF spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, said the Israeli military could carry out its planned operations without US support. \u201cThe army has armaments for the missions it plans, and for the missions in Rafah too. We have what we need.\u201d\nA major offensive on the city of Rafah would threaten the lives of more than 1 million Palestinians who have sought haven there and who have not received any significant provisions in terms of shelter, food, water and medical support from Israel.\nTheir survival has already been made more precarious by the closing of the two crossings into southern Gaza, Rafah and Kerem Shalom, on Monday when the IDF began action to capture the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing, to the east of the city.\nRafah has run out of fuel and its hospitals are in danger of being overwhelmed, according to medical staff.\nKerem Shalom reopened on Thursday, but aid trucks were unable to navigate the roads because of security concerns and battle damage.\nMeanwhile, very little aid is entering Gaza through the northern gate at Erez, close to where hundreds of thousands of people who have been cut off by the Israeli offensive are in imminent danger of starvation, according to the UN and aid agencies.\nAlexandra Saieh, the head of humanitarian policy and advocacy for Save the Children, said access through Erez crossing had been sporadic.\n\u201cErez never became fully operational,\u201d she said at an online press conference. \u201cThe humanitarian access needed to stave off famine that was projected back in March has not been granted.\u201d\nLate on Thursday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said it had temporarily closed its East Jerusalem headquarters after an arson attack by Israeli protesters.\nIn a post on X, Philippe Lazzarini, Unrwa\u2019s commissioner-general, said that a crowd accompanied by armed men gathered outside the compound chanting \u201cBurn down the United Nations\u201d before setting the fire.\nCyprus announced on Thursday that a first aid ship had left the island to go to a US-made floating pier, from where humanitarian assistance is supposed to be unloaded and distributed. However, US engineers have yet to connect a causeway to the Gaza coast, along which the aid is meant to be driven on to the land, and there remain many unanswered questions over how provisions would then be distributed.\nUS officials said the capture of the Rafah crossing was a tactical operation with a low number of casualties. The UN, however, said intensified IDF attacks on the Rafah area had triggered the exodus of more than 100,000 people \u2013 the largest population movement in Gaza for many months. The mass displacement of people in the event of a large-scale Rafah offensive would be far greater.\nIn his remarks on Thursday, Kirby spelled out what sort of Israeli operations would trigger further US restrictions on arms. \u201cI think we all understand what a major ground operation looks like in terms of the size of the forces involved, the kinds of operations that would connote large forces, large movements, a lot of civilian casualties, a lot of damaged infrastructure \u2013 as opposed to more precise, more targeted, more limited kinds of operations, like we are seeing right now down at the Rafah crossing.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cA lot is going to depend on what we see Israel do in Rafah and in their planning for Rafah.\u201d\nAfter his warning of more curbs on weapons supplies, Biden faced a backlash from Israeli and US Republican politicians, who accused him of letting Israel down in the face of existential threats.\nBezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, wrote on X: \u201cWe must continue the war until Hamas is totally eliminated and our hostages are back home. This involves conquering Rafah completely and the sooner the better.\u201d\nItamar Ben-Gvir, another far-right minister, posted \u201cBiden \u2013 heart emoji \u2013 Hamas\u201d on social media, but later said Israel should \u201crespect our friends but also fight our enemies without considering other factors and without compromises\u201d.\nThe populist politician\u2019s earlier tweet prompted a reprimand from Isaac Herzog, Israel\u2019s president, who called Biden \u201ca great friend of the state of Israel\u201d and criticised \u201cbaseless, irresponsible and insulting statements and tweets\u201d during a speech marking the anniversary of VE Day.\nYair Lapid, the leader of Israel\u2019s main opposition party, called for Ben-Gvir to be fired for \u201cendangering every soldier in the IDF and every citizen in the state of Israel\u201d.\nKirby said on Thursday that Israeli forces were \u201cstill getting that [weaponry], the vast, vast majority of everything that they need to defend themselves\u201d.\n\u201cWe could also in fact help them target the leaders, including Mr Sinwar, which we are frankly doing with the Israelis on an ongoing basis,\u201d Kirby added in what appeared to be the first US confirmation that the US had been providing help to the Israelis in targeting Hamas leaders including Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the 7 October attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 Israelis.\nDr Yonatan Freeman, an international relations expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said Biden\u2019s announcement, far from pressuring Netanyahu, could strengthen the Israeli prime minister.\n\u201cSome are saying Netanyahu has ruined Israel\u2019s relationship with the US but others are saying this shows that we are alone, and that the lesson of history is that we can\u2019t trust that anyone will be with us always and in every way. That\u2019s what Netanyahu has been saying and that\u2019s the narrative that is dominant in the mind of most Israelis, and so the whole issue will strengthen Netanyahu\u2019s political position,\u201d Freeman said.", "59205": "title: Humanitarian Access Snapshot - Gaza Strip | 1-30 April 2024 \n content: Access restrictions\nHumanitarian operations in Gaza continue to face severe humanitarian access restrictions, including the ongoing closure of key crossings, denials of planned missions, and delays in movements imposed by Israeli authorities. The combination of severe access constraints and ongoing insecurity has resulted in a non-permissive and volatile operational environment for humanitarian actors. Humanitarian organisations must be enabled by all parties to the conflict to safely address the unprecedented levels of need in Gaza.\nInsecurity for humanitarian workers and civilians\nIntense hostilities in Gaza, including aerial bombardment in densely populated urban areas and military ground operations, pose a significant threat to civilians, including humanitarian personnel, undermining humanitarian access and operations. A Humanitarian Notification System (HNS) informs parties to the conflict about the location of humanitarian premises\u2014such as offices, warehouses and guesthouses\u2014and movements of humanitarian entities, aiming to prevent harm or damage. The HNS does not alter the international humanitarian law (IHL) obligations of parties to the conflict, but aids in informing them about humanitarian presence, thereby supporting their compliance with these obligations. Additionally, the use of HNS by humanitarian partners is entirely voluntary.\nOn 1 April, seven aid workers employed by World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed in targeted airstrikes by the Israeli army. Israeli missiles struck a WCK convoy that was coordinating its movements with the Israeli authorities at the time of the strike, after transporting humanitarian food supplies to a warehouse in Deir al Balah. At least 254 aid workers have been killed in Gaza between 7 October 2023 and 30 April 2024, including 185 UN staff members and 27 staff and volunteers from the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). Persistent hostilities, air strikes, and the general breakdown of law and order in Gaza continue to pose significant security threats to humanitarian personnel and assets. These conditions prompted multiple humanitarian organizations to temporarily pause, suspend, or delay operations.\nAccess denials or delays\nDuring April, Israeli authorities continued to deny the access of humanitarian organizations to areas where the UN had assessed that coordination with Israeli forces was required, including for life-saving activities. Israeli authorities denied 10 per cent of requested missions in Gaza. Denials were issued for a range of life-saving humanitarian activities and operations, including food assistance, emergency medical and health support, medical evacuations, and critical water, sanitation, and hygiene assistance. This has exacerbated the humanitarian needs of affected people. Emergency medical and health missions were particularly affected by access denials and delays.\nOn 16 April, a humanitarian organization faced significant delays imposed by the Israeli army totaling more than six hours and 30 minutes during a coordinated mission to Al Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza. The mission aimed to deliver essential medical supplies and fuel to the hospitals to support about 10,000 people for two weeks, as well as refer injured patients from northern Gaza to southern Gaza. However, due to prolonged delays imposed by the Israeli army, both the truck transporting medical supplies and the fuel tanker were forced to turn back. Only the objective of patient referral was achieved. Four days later, the organizations attempted the mission again, only to face seven hours of delays, once more disrupting the delivery of essential medical supplies and fuel.\nIn late March, Israeli authorities barred the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from operating convoys north of the Israeli forces checkpoint. UNRWA had previously been one of the three agencies providing food assistance in northern Gaza, where more than 300,000 people are currently projected to face Famine (IPC 5) levels of food insecurity.\nIn addition to denials, humanitarian movements crossing from southern to northern Gaza have faced substantial delays: 41 missions experienced extensive delays of over two hours. The average delay time was 268 minutes (about 4 hours and 30 minutes). Humanitarian convoys are frequently required to wait for extended periods at checkpoints, creating operational bottlenecks and posing security risks due to the prevalence of security incidents and hazards in the surrounding areas. Persistent late openings or complete closures of Israeli military checkpoints impeded humanitarian operations throughout April. Further, humanitarian movements were restricted by the Israeli authorities due to strict checkpoint operating hours and timeframes, often forcing organizations to abort their missions.\nDefinitions for coordinated missions\nFacilitated: The mission is approved by the Israeli Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA) and proceeded without any impediments caused or imposed by the Israeli army.\nCancelled: The mission is cancelled by the humanitarian organization due to internal reasons.\nImpeded: The mission is impeded by the Israeli army and is not able to achieve its objectives fully or partly.\nDenied: The mission is denied by CLA.\nIn April, 21 missions were cancelled, 20 missions were denied and 34 missions were impeded. Throughout April, Erez crossing and Ashdod port had not been made fully available to all humanitarian organisations to bring in supplies into the north of Gaza. In addition, at least one checkpoint operated by Unidentified armed Palestinians was reported by humanitarian actors within Gaza.\nSevere road damage and Unexploded Ordinances\nOngoing hostilities have destroyed or otherwise damaged roads and key infrastructure throughout Gaza, posing physical barriers to access and limiting humanitarian movements. Routes that remain available for use by humanitarian organizations are frequently blocked by debris, heavily congested, and contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO). An estimated 37.5 million metric tons (MT) of conflict-generated debris are estimated to be present throughout Gaza, with 3.2 million MT attributed to damaged roads. The UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) reports that a considerable amount of this debris contains UXO, noting that at least 10 percent of fired ammunition potentially fails to function. Clearing all explosive threats in Gaza could take up to 14 years, UNMAS estimates. A UN assessment team surveying Khan Younis on 10 April reported that the streets and public areas were heavily contaminated with UXO, including unexploded 1,000-pound bombs at major intersections and within school premises. The debris is also estimated to contain about 800,000 MT of asbestos and other contaminants, posing serious health and safety issues.\nThe infrastructure damage increases travel time for humanitarian movements, leading to significant delays, mission postponements and cancellations, and additional security risks. Consequently, the capacity of humanitarian organizations to provide vital assistance to affected people is undermined. Urgent efforts to repair and reopen roads for humanitarian convoys are crucial to ensure the delivery of assistance to those most in need.\nExample: Incidents during coordinated missions\nOn 9 April, a humanitarian organization attempted to implement a coordinated mission to Gaza city with 18,000 litres of fuel. However, like other organizations traveling to northern Gaza, the organization was required to wait at a holding point approximately two and a half kilometers south of the Israeli military Salah Ad Din checkpoint, the the militarized boundary between northern and southern Gaza. The organization awaited clearance from Israeli authorities to proceed through the Israeli army checkpoint. While at the holding point, the fuel tanker encountered mechanical issues, preventing it from restarting. When an accompanying UN vehicle was dispatched to the checkpoint to explain the situation to Israeli soldiers, the team observed a Palestinian man with a gunshot wound to the head, still alive but rapidly losing blood. The organization, in coordination with OCHA, urgently requested permission from Israeli authorities to provide first aid and transport the injured man to an ambulance. While waiting for the approval, live ammunition was fired from the direction of the checkpoint, hitting the fuel tanker\u2019s windscreen. The approval to assist the injured man was never granted, and the man died after more than two hours without medical treatment.", "59265": "title: Israel objects to US decision to pause some arms shipments \n content: Israeli officials objected Thursday to U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to pause a shipment of some weapons to Israel amid concern over Israel\u2019s plan to expand a military operation in Rafah that the United States does not support.\nIsraeli Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan called the move \u201ca difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war.\u201d\nFar-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir posted on X, formerly known as Twittter, \u201cHamas loves Biden.\u201d\nBiden told CNN in an interview aired Wednesday night that the U.S. would continue to supply Israel with defensive arms, such as Iron Dome munitions.\n\u201cI made it clear that if they go into Rafah \u2014 they haven\u2019t gone in Rafah yet \u2014 if they go into Rafah, I\u2019m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem,\u201d he said.\nBiden\u2019s decision followed discussions with Israel on how it will \u201coperate differently against Hamas there than they have elsewhere in Gaza,\u201d a senior administration official said in a statement sent to VOA. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.\nA ground assault on Rafah, in the southern part of Gaza, would endanger the lives of 1.3 million civilians who evacuated from the north and central parts of the territory to seek safety from Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel.\nAdministration officials have repeatedly said the U.S. will not support a Rafah invasion unless Israel provides a credible plan on how it would protect civilians. In an April 4 phone call, Biden warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he would withhold military aid unless Israel changes its war conduct.\nDeliberations on withholding arms began in April as Israel seemed closer to a decision on Rafah, the official said. Since then, the Israelis \u201chave not fully addressed our concerns,\u201d and the decision to pause the arms transfer was executed \u201clast week.\u201d\nThe shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 907-kilogram (2,000 pound) bombs and 1,700 226-kilogram (500 pound) bombs. The administration said it is mainly concerned with the \u201cend-use of the 2,000-lb. bombs and the impact they could have in dense urban settings as we have seen in other parts of Gaza.\u201d\nThe official said other equipment under review includes Joint Direct Attack Munition kits that convert so-called dumb bombs into precision-guided munitions.\nThe paused shipments are drawn from previously appropriated funds, not from the supplemental appropriations that Congress passed in April.\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring Israel gets every dollar appropriated in the supplemental,\u201d the official said, highlighting the recent approval of $827 million worth of weapons and equipment, the latest tranche of foreign military financing.\nThe pause marks the first time the U.S. leveraged a weapons transfer to influence Israel\u2019s war conduct since Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attack.\nFormer President Donald Trump accused Biden in a social media post early Thursday of \"taking the side\u201d of Hamas.\nMembers of the U.S. House of Representatives from Biden\u2019s Democratic Party praised the move, including Representative Ayanna Pressley, who said the United States \u201chas a clear obligation to stop the massacre of innocent civilians.\u201d\nDemocratic Representative Seth Moulton said he was even more skeptical of Israel\u2019s plan for Rafah after meeting with the Israeli ambassador.\n\u201cI've always said that Israel must defeat Hamas. The question is whether invading Rafah ultimately helps or hurts that cause,\u201d Moulton said. \u201cI support President Biden\u2019s decision.\u201d\nLawmakers push back\nIn a Senate hearing Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers that the administration had not made a final determination on how to proceed with the shipment, \u201cin the context of the unfolding events in Rafah.\u201d\nThe announcement was welcomed by progressive Democrats but criticized by Republican lawmakers.\nDemocratic Senator Peter Welch praised the Biden administration for pausing deliveries of \u201cbombs that have devastated Gaza.\u201d\nBut Senate Republicans called Biden\u2019s decision a serious deportation from normal procedures.\n\u201cThe non-partisan weapons sales process has kept the domestic political squabbles out of this for a long, long time. It's been in place for about a half a century and it has worked really, really well. The administration has stepped outside those boundaries,\u201d Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters Thursday.\n\u201cThe administration allowed these weapons sales. Myself and the other three members of Congress closely looked at these sales and take that obligation seriously, all signed off on it. And now in the heat of battle this administration is saying we're going to pull this back. This is unprecedented.\u201d\nMcConnell and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson sent Biden a letter demanding answers from the Biden administration on why the administration had delayed the arms delivery.\nReports of the pause in the weapons shipment first surfaced Tuesday on the same day that President Biden reiterated his support for Israel.\n\u201cMy commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,\u201d he said in an impassioned speech Tuesday to honor the memory of the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust and other victims of Nazi persecution.\nIsrael is the largest recipient of U.S. aid, nearly $4 billion a year, most of it in the form of military assistance.\n\u201cThe American taxpayer has subsidized Israel's manufactured humanitarian crisis in Gaza,\u201d said Ari Tolany, director of security assistance, arms trade and technology at the Center for International Policy. \u201cIf the administration will continue to arm and train Israel no matter what, Israel has no incentive to change its behavior,\u201d she told VOA.\nThe decision follows a whirlwind of events in the past few days regarding the possibility of a cease-fire in Gaza.\nA deal to end hostilities paired with the release of hostages held by Hamas for Palestinians detained in Israeli jails appeared within reach Monday when Hamas said it has accepted the terms for truce. Netanyahu rejected that version of the deal and ordered Israeli forces to carry out a \u201climited operation\u201d in eastern Rafah.\nReport to Congress\nAt the same time, the administration missed a Wednesday deadline to submit a report to Congress on whether Israel is violating humanitarian law while using U.S.-supplied weapons in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas.\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said during Tuesday\u2019s briefing that the National Security Memorandum \"will not be transmitted today. We continue to work to finalize the report. We expect to deliver it in the very near future.\u201d\nUnder the National Security Memorandum 20 (NSM20), issued in February, Biden directed the departments of State and Defense to report to Congress within 90 days on whether U.S. partners that were provided with American weapons have complied with international and U.S. laws.\nThat includes the Leahy Laws, two legislative provisions named for Senator Patrick Leahy, that mandate the U.S. cut off assistance to any foreign military or law enforcement units if it determines there is credible evidence of human rights violations.\nIsrael provided its assurances of NSM20 compliance in March, and the State Department was due to report to Congress on Wednesday whether it finds Israel's assurances credible.\nThe delay could be due to a \u201csubstantive disagreement being resolved or just regular bureaucracy,\u201d rather than an effort to created added pressure on Israel, said Josh Paul, former director of the State Department agency that deals with weapons transfers.\n\u201cBut we will see what the report says,\u201d Paul told VOA. \u201cIf it becomes an extended delay, that could be indicative of a rewrite.\u201d\nHuman rights groups and independent observers have for weeks called for a suspension of American weapons transfers to Israel, alleging they have been used in violation of international humanitarian and human rights law.\nIn April, Paul, alongside other former administration officials and academicians, submitted a report detailing what it said were unlawful Israeli attacks on civilians using American weapons.\nAmnesty International submitted a similar report ahead of the NSM20 deadline.\nVOA congressional correspondent Katherine Gypson and Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb and State Department bureau chief Nike Ching contributed to this report.", "60202": "title: Rafah residents face \u2018the fire of hell\u2019 as Israeli tanks seize border crossing \n content: For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it an \u201cimportant step\u201d toward dismantling Hamas.\nIt came hours after Hamas announced it had accepted an Egyptian-Qatari mediated ceasefire and hostage proposal. Mr Netanyahu said that the proposal fell far short of Israel\u2019s \u201cessential\u201d demands. Negotiations for a truce in Cairo are ongoing \u2013 with Israel saying it had sent officials to the Egyptian capital \u2013 but on a knife edge.\nIn Gaza, the UN warned that a full-scale assault on the area and continued closure of Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings would have a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact on hundreds of thousands of people mostly living in the tents there.\nThe UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, warned it had less than a day\u2019s worth of fuel, needed to power trucks, the remaining hospitals, as well as water and sewage pumps.\nJens Laerke, the spokesperson for the UN\u2019s humanitarian office, said the closures were the most effective way to put the aid response \u201cin its grave\u201d.\nA Palestinian family, including several young children, are seen fleeing Rafah this morning ( AFP via Getty Images )\n\u201cRafah and Kerem Shalom are main arteries of the humanitarian operation for not only Rafah but the entire Gaza strip, and have been currently choked off completely. That is catastrophic,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\u201cThere are very little in terms of stockpiles inside Gaza. There were still vastly inadequate amounts of aid coming into Gaza. The aid comes in and is distributed pretty much immediately.\u201d\nHe said the start of the ground assault in Rafah was devastating for civilians who had nowhere to go as most of the strip had been \u201cbombed into moonscapes\u201d and was littered with unexploded ordinances.\n\u201cThis is one of the worst mornings of this seven-month nightmare. Yesterday, we saw pictures of people celebrating [and] dancing in the streets. There was a glimmer of hope that finally we have a ceasefire, then just a few hours later, no.\n\u201cIt\u2019s soul-crushing. These are very dark days.\u201d\nCivilians in Rafah told The Independent they experienced \u201cthe most difficult night\u201d of bombing since the war erupted seven months ago.\n\u201cIt was like the fire of hell. I saw missiles fall like rain. Rockets with a very terrifying sound. Their bodies were still lying in the streets. There was continuous artillery shelling and airstrikes,\u201d said Abu Yahya Zoroub, 37, who was near the crossing when Israel forces pushed in.\nHe said people were calling for help but it was near impossible for ambulances and first responders to reach the areas.\n\u201cIt was like the fire of hell. I saw missiles fall like rain Abu Yahya, in eastern Rafah\nFood prices, meanwhile, have more than doubled, and families scrambled to evacuate \u2013 some walking, some using donkey carts and some in the backs of trucks.\n\u201cThere will be a famine here,\u201d Mr Zoroub added.\nIsrael has launched its most ferocious ever bombardment of Gaza and imposed a crippling siege in retaliation for Hamas\u2019s bloody 7 October attack on southern Israel. Around 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack, while another 250 were taken hostage, including toddlers.\nThe Palestinian health ministry says Israel\u2019s bombing has killed nearly 35,000 people, the majority of them women and children. The UN says restrictions on aid have created a \u201cman-made famine\u201d with half the 2.3 million strong population of the strip at catastrophic levels of hunger.\nThat is only expected to worsen if Israel escalates its ground offensive in Rafah, which Mr Netanyahu said is the last holdout for Hamas militants and an essential part of their battle for \u201cvictory\u201d.\nThe Israeli military said its ground troops on Monday night \u201cbegan a precise counterterrorism operation\u201d based on intelligence that indicated Hamas was using Rafah for \u201cterrorist purposes\u201d.\nPalestinians inspect the damage following Israeli bombardment of Rafah's Tal al-Sultan district in the southern Gaza Strip ( AFP/Getty )\nThe UN\u2019s secretary general, Antonio Guterres, appealed to Israel and Hamas to spare no effort to get a truce deal and warned Israel that a full assault on Rafah would \"be a strategic mistake, a political calamity, and a humanitarian nightmare.\"\n\u201cIt would be tragic if weeks of intense diplomatic activity for peace in Gaza, yield no ceasefire. No release of hostages. And a devastating offensive in Rafah,\u201d he said.\nOn Tuesday, the Palestinian Authority called on the United States to \u201cintervene immediately\u201d to prevent Israel from invading Rafah, the official Palestinian Wafa news agency said.\nTalks were also continuing in Cairo for a ceasefire and hostage deal that could see in the first phase at least 33 Israeli hostages released in exchange for the release of hundreds Palestinian prisoners.\nSources close to the negotiations told The Independent that they had \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that a deal would eventually be signed, as the current proposal Hamas agreed to on Monday was based on a previous proposal drafted by Israel in late April.\nSome sticking points including the use of the word \u201cceasefire\u201d in the document had been resolved.\nBut others were still being battled out in the Egyptian capital \u2013 including the duration of the first phase and the fact that the deal would see female soldiers released too late in the process. Pressure is mounting from Israel\u2019s closest ally, the US. The Independent understands that president Joe Biden had a tough call with Mr Netanyahu where Washington made it clear the Rafah offensive had to end and a hostage deal be signed.\nWe are talking about aid into Gaza being strangled Tamara Al-Rifae/UNRWA\nA State Department spokesperson said in an email on Tuesday: \u201cWe continue to believe that a hostage deal is in the best interest of the Israeli and the Palestinian people; it would bring an immediate ceasefire and allow increased humanitarian assistance into Gaza.\u201d\nIn the interim, Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings remain closed, crippling the humanitarian response.\nTamara al-Rifae, spokesperson for UNRWA, said that the agency\u2019s most immediate concern was fuel for the delivery of aid, for hospitals, and for the water supply.\n\u201cAs of yesterday, we had one day\u2019s worth of operations with the fuel that we had. Because of the scarcity, the trickle of aid that's been going in, we do not have stockpiles of emergency aid supplies ready to be deployed as a contingency.\u201d She added: \u201cWe are talking about aid into Gaza being strangled.\u201d\nA World Health Organization spokesperson said that the Rafah border crossing was also closed for the evacuation of sick and injured patients. Palestinian health officials said Tuesday that 140 wounded and sick people were supposed to cross from Gaza into Egypt today but were barred from doing so.\nMahmoud Gaith, 50, who fled eastern Rafah overnight, said there were \u201cintense belts of fire\u201d \u2013 when multiple bombs are dropped at the same time \u2013 as well as hundreds of artillery and air raids.\nAt Begin Gate in Tel Aviv: \u2018Decision time \u2013 life or death' ( Ronit Ben David )\n\u201cLast night was one of the most difficult nights we have had since 7 October. They did not give people a chance to evacuate,\u201d he said as he fled northwest.\n\u201cNow I do not know where my family will go. There is no safe place to move to. All areas are vulnerable to danger; even safe places do not have the necessities to live in; otherwise, they are full of displaced people.\u201d\nThere is also growing concern among the families of the remaining 130 hostages, who are still believed to be in the besieged strip.\nOn Monday night, families of the hostages gathered outside the Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv demanding a ceasefire and the immediate return of their loved ones.\n\u201c\u2018This is the time to exert your influence on the Israeli government and all other parties concerned to ensure that the agreement comes through which will finally bring all our loved ones home,\u201d they said in a statement.\nGil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel, 39, is among the dozens of hostages still held in Gaza, told The Independent that families were sending a clear message to the Israeli war cabinet.\n\u201cThe ball is in your court. Sign the deal and bring them home now,\u201d he said.", "60389": "title: Israeli forces bringing war to the West Bank, warns UN rights office \n content: \u201cThe Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) is acting as if there is an armed conflict in the West Bank,\u201d Ajith Sunghay, head of the OHCHR office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told UN News.\nHe said the situation there was already very dire even before hostilities erupted in Gaza following the brutal Hamas-led incursion into Israel on 7 October.\nSettler violence and demolitions\nLast year was the deadliest ever for Palestinians in the West Bank since the UN began keeping records in 2005, and there was also a spike in violations including settler violence, excessive use of force by the IDF, demolitions and evictions.\nDemolitions were reported on Tuesday in the northern village of Furush Beit Dajan, the UN humanitarian affairs office, OCHA, said on social media.\nTweet URL ochaopt\nMr. Sunghay said that while global attention has been focused on Gaza, the intensity and frequency of violations increased in the West Bank.\n\u201cIf we talk about the number of people killed or injured, either because of these massive incursions by the IDF into the West Bank \u2013 particularly in Tulkarem, Jenin, Nablus, sometimes into Jericho and other parts as well \u2013 that spiked up,\u201d he said.\nThe number of people detained has also \u201cspiked up massively\u201d, reaching close to 9,000, he added.\nHe noted that \u201cwhatever happens in Gaza has a massive impact on the West Bank,\u201d and vice versa, \u201cbecause they're the same people\u201d.\n\u201cWe now see huge fear among the population of the West Bank as well on a regular basis, worried about incursions, worried about raids, worried about arrest and detention, worried about settler violence and, of course, with massive significant movement restrictions that impacts their day-to-day life.\u201d\nSoundcloud\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity\nAjith Sunghay: Our biggest concern is the spike in violence we are seeing, particularly coming from very emboldened settlers. Because the attention is focused on Gaza, they feel emboldened.\nThere\u2019s been massive lack of accountability or, in other words, impunity for violations that have been committed by the IDF in the West Bank, so they continue to violate or continue to attack Palestinians, Palestinian towns and villages. So, the lack of safety and security of people is at the top-most concern for us.\nThe Israeli Defense Forces is acting as if there is an armed conflict in the West Bank. The applicable law in the West Bank is the human rights law enforcement framework, which means the force that the IDF can use is limited to that legal framework.\nIn the West Bank, there is no armed conflict, but the nature of these operations that are being conducted by the IDF indicate that they're using massive numbers of soldiers, drones, sometimes fighter jets dropping bombs, shoulder-fired missiles \u2013 heavy weapons \u2013 which are used generally in an armed conflict, not in law enforcement.\nAnother concern is movement restrictions, arrests and detention. People are unable to move between towns, communities and cities within the West Bank. That has had a major impact on the economy and on the family structures, society and, more generally, the Palestinian community.\nUN News: In this situation, when we're speaking about an occupied territory, it is supposed that the occupying power acts as law enforcement, as the side that maintains law and order. But, based on what you are describing, it is vice versa. Can you explain?\nAjith Sunghay: That is correct, and unfortunately, that has been the case. In international law, the responsibility and the obligation of the occupying power is to provide protection. That is expected of Israel and that includes the IDF that is to provide safety and security and protect the population of the occupied territory, and that is the Palestinians.\nHowever, what we have seen consistently and that has increased since the 7 October is that the IDF ends up providing security to the settlers who are actually attacking Palestinians.\nMany times we have found them being bystanders. In many cases, they have facilitated these attacks. In many instances, we have started seeing that the settlers are also wearing IDF clothes, so it\u2019s very difficult to distinguish between the two.\nUnfortunately, the IDF, and more broadly Israel, have not honoured their obligation under international humanitarian law, but, on the contrary, have only committed more human rights violations.\n\u00a9 UNICEF/Alaa Badarneh Children walk through partially destroyed streets in Jenin in the West Bank.\nUN News: In such circumstances, who is there to protect Palestinians and their rights?\nAjith Sunghay: That's a good question. This is where, I think, the vacuum comes in. In many instances in many pockets of the West Bank as well, there is a vacuum for the protection of Palestinians. In cases of settler violence, for instance, the Palestinians are expected to go and file a complaint with the Israeli police or IDF who are inside the Israeli settlements.\nFor me, that doesn't make any sense. When they\u2019re attacked by the Israeli settlers, how do you expect a Palestinian to go inside an Israeli settlement, which is already quite scary for them, and go and complain? And when they have seen consistent lack of accountability, why would they do that?\nSo, you don\u2019t find many Palestinians going and lodging complaints. In the end, that\u2019s what leaves a massive protection gap for Palestinians.\nUN News: When you are speaking of attacks or any actions by settlers, what kind of clashes are those?\nAjith Sunghay: There are many. In the past, we used to see one settler attacking a herder or a Palestinian who is probably moving around. What we have seen in 2023 and moving further into 2024 is much more organised settlers attacking in groups against Palestinian towns and villages and communities.\nThey coordinate an attack, or coordinate gatherings, and then attack a community. It can be from stones and sticks to weapons, including firearms and guns. That's where we have seen in many cases Palestinians being shot, injured and in many, many cases killed as well.\nBut, in many cases where they have attacked the community, particularly a village or a town, we have seen shops, vehicles, houses, the entire community being burnt down. So, it has increased both in terms of intensity as well as the frequency and then the kind of attacks that we have seen over the years.\nUN News: You mean to say that those are not actions in response to some activity on behalf of Palestinians, but rather something which is organised, coordinated and even instigated by the settlers themselves?\nAjith Sunghay: We have to remember one thing: the settlements over the years have expanded massively, which means settlements and settlers live extremely close or next to the Palestinian community. So, the constant chance of meeting each other or having friction, incidents or clashes increase.\nUN News: In this situation, you record all those cases and report on them. Do you also interact with Palestinian human rights defenders\u2019 groups? Are there such groups on both sides, Israel and Palestine, and do you interact with all of them?\nAjith Sunghay: We record all violations, not just settler violence, but also house evictions, house demolitions, detention, ranging from economic and social to civil and political rights. We don\u2019t do this on our own either.\nOne of our chief functions is to make sure that civil society space is maintained, and we work very closely with a range of organisations, both UN as well as national and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). And when we talk about national, both Palestinian as well as Israeli NGOs. We have established this network over the years.\nWhat has happened, however, over the last few years is a massive shrinking of space for different reasons and, to be honest, it also comes from all three sides: Israel, the Palestinian Authority as well as the de facto authorities. However, I think much of those restrictions come from Israel.\nFor instance, a couple of years ago, Israel designated with no evidence, six human rights NGOs as terrorist organisations. When you do something of that sort, you will have support dwindling to these NGOs, whether we mean it or not, whether we like it or not. And that's the space we are trying to push back. We are trying to help NGOs do their job. It\u2019s extremely important that we are there on the ground and are able to record these violations.\nSimilarly, the Israeli NGOs have also faced such threats. For instance, when the Israeli Government threatens 65 per cent tax on any incoming funds from abroad, that was in a way to squeeze the space of Israeli NGOs.\nOHCHR Ajith Sunghay (second from left), Head of the UN human rights office, OHCHR, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, during a mission to the West Bank in February 2024.\nUN News: Since October, a number of Gazans have had to stay in the West Bank.

No one knows the exact number. A number of them were then released through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza. We do not have a full picture of the number who were released or of those who are still in detention.\nHowever, of those who have been detained, several of them have given us consistent accounts of being ill-treated, humiliated, sexually abused and tortured.

We are heading to Mawasi because there is no safety with the Israelis. They are killing women and children.\u201d\nAnother woman from eastern Rafah said, \u201cThe Israelis sent us messages ordering us to leave. We cannot stay.\u201d\nOn Monday, the Israeli military called on an estimated 100,000 Palestinians living in parts of eastern Rafah to \u201cevacuate immediately,\u201d telling them to move to Al-Mawasi, a coastal town near the city of Khan Younis that aid groups say is not appropriate for habitation.\nThe current war began on October 7 when Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and took more than 200 people hostage.\nIn the almost seven months since, Israel\u2019s military bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 34,600 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and driven more than 1 million Palestinians to seek refuge in Rafah, a city that the medical NGO Medicines San Frontieres said was absent of the \u201cnecessary conditions for survival.\u201d\nA displaced Palestinian, who fled Rafah after the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of civilians, sits on a vehicle, in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on May 6, 2024. Ramadan Abed\nCNN witnessed people in eastern Rafah in a state of panic following Monday\u2019s evacuation announcement, which sparked a flurry of appeals from world leaders, the United Nations, and humanitarian groups urging Israel not to carry out its long-threatened assault.\nThe move was described as \u201cinhumane\u201d by United Nations human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk and \u201cbeyond alarming\u201d by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\nFaisal Barbakh, who fled on his bicycle, said he is leaving a lifetime of memories behind \u201cfor the unknown.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m carrying all of my life here. My family is torn in seven places. I feel it\u2019s the end of life. I can\u2019t think anymore. I left 59 years of life behind, all of my memories, my children\u2019s pictures, the contract of my house.\u201d\nVideo and images from eastern Rafah showed trucks full of people\u2019s belongings driving through the streets, which became increasingly crowded as Monday wore on. Children were seen sitting among tanks of fuel and plastic bags filled with possessions, and families left with mattresses strapped to the roof of their cars.\nMany of those leaving eastern Rafah have been previously displaced multiple times as Israel\u2019s focus has moved from city to city.\n\u201cThis is the fourth time I\u2019m being displaced. From Nuseirat to Khan Younis, then to Rafah, and now another one.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters\nIsrael takes \u2018operational control\u2019 of crossing\nAfter the Israeli military stormed the Rafah crossing, Palestinian flags were replaced with Israeli flags, which according to photos on social media, could be seen mounted outside the main building.\nThe border crossing has been a key humanitarian aid portal, with as many as 300 trucks entering the strip through it each day, according to an announcement from Egypt last month.\nWael Abu Omar, a spokesperson for the General Authority of Border and Crossing, told CNN that all movement and aid shipments through Rafah had stopped \u201cafter Israeli tanks captured the crossing facilities from the Palestinian side.\u201d\nAid groups quickly expressed concern that the Israeli operation there could bring humanitarian relief efforts across the Gaza Strip to a standstill.\n\u201cContinued interruption of the entry of aid and fuel supplies at the Rafah crossing will halt the critical humanitarian response across the Gaza Strip,\u201d the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on X.\nIt added that the \u201ccatastrophic hunger faced by people especially in northern Gaza will get much worse if these supply routes are interrupted.\u201d\nCNN has reached out to the IDF and COGAT on this and asked about any plans to keep aid getting into Gaza.\nIn recent months, Israeli strikes have further deteriorated conditions for those living and sheltering in the city, including an estimated 600,000 children. Malnutrition is rapidly spreading and medical facilities are \u201crendered ineffective by the Israeli authorities\u2019 siege,\u201d Medicines San Frontieres said.\nThe UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said \u201cRafah is now a city of children, who have nowhere safe to go in Gaza.\u201d An Israeli ground incursion \u201cwould pose catastrophic risks\u201d to the already injured, sick, malnourished, and traumatized people who have no safe place to go, it said.\nTwo boys, Malek and Yousef, were making their own way of Rafah out on bicycles Monday, clinging to their bags. \u201cWe are running away from the Israelis.

IDF/AP\nNo \u2018safe zones\u2019 in Gaza, EU\u2019s top diplomat says\nThere has been a chorus of condemnation over the situation facing many in Rafah and other places in the strip after Israel ignored international calls against proceeding with the operation.\nThe European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Tuesday that there were \u201cno \u2018safe zones\u2019 in Gaza\u201d after criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\u201cThe land offensive against Rafah has started again, in spite of all of the requests of the international community \u2013 the US, the European Union member states \u2013 everybody asking Netanyahu not to attack Rafah,\u201d Borrell said, adding: \u201cI am afraid that this is going to cause again a lot of casualties, civilian casualties.\u201d\nMeanwhile, fuel shortages in Rafah have prevented people from fleeing and reaching the Israeli-designated \u201cexpanded humanitarian area\u201d in Al-Mawasi, Suze van Meegen, the NRC head of operations in Palestine told CNN on Tuesday.\n\u201cYesterday, we saw thousands of people moving away from their homes or their camps in southeastern Rafah, many on foot, many using vehicles, using donkey carts, but there is a shortage of fuel. And not only there is no safe place to go, for many people, there\u2019s no way to get there,\u201d van Meegen said in a phone interview from Rafah.\nA Palestinian youth carries a child as he walks through rubble in Rafah's Tal al-Sultan district on Tuesday. AFP/Getty Images\nFor those that are able to travel the many kilometers to the coastal town near Khan Younis, they arrive to find it already crowded with displaced people, some of the new arrivals appeared confused and disorientated. The streets were packed with trucks and donkey carts, surrounded by huge piles of garbage.\n\u201cI came here from Rafah and didn\u2019t find any place to stay. People even say we should leave [here]. I swear, I don\u2019t know where to go. They distributed leaflets, and people panicked and started running away,\u201d said Mohammad Abu Khamash.\nUNRWA previously warned that Al-Mawasi is not appropriate for habitation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not somewhere that\u2019s quite suitable for people to put up tents and to be able to sit and try to live and meet their basic necessities every day,\u201d Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza, told CNN Monday.\nMany of those fleeing on Monday said there is nowhere safe for them and their families.\n\u201cWe had to endure airstrikes that put our lives and our children\u2019s lives at risk. We left in search of a bit of dignified life that we can live with our families,\u201d said Ahmad Safi, who left Rafah for Khan Younis with his family.\nPalestinians inspect a house damaged in an Israeli strike in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Tuesday.

I came to Khan Younis and I felt so depressed. It was a city full of life and happiness, but now it is not even suitable for living. We are eight family members. We came on a cart from Rafah. I am still in shock that we left Rafah.\u201d\nRafah resident Abu Salah said he had left the city under heavy Israeli fire.\n\u201cIs safety being displaced from place to place like a cat with its children, begging for a bit of water and a coupon (for food)?\u201d he said.\nA woman called Maha said Palestinian civilians were at the mercy of the Israeli military.\n\u201cThey can tell you to go here and kill you here, or they tell you to go there and they kill you there. They don\u2019t want safety for us,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe solution is to finish this cause, not only to stop the war, but to have a Palestinian state,\u201d she added.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "61180": "title: oPt Emergency Situation Update Issue 29 7 Oct 2023 - 30 Apr 2024 at 16:00 \n content: Gaza Strip\n\nAs of 30 April 2024 Overview Source: Ministry of Health.\n\nAccording to Israeli authorities, over 1200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed inside Israel, and approximately 5,400 reported injuries.

This is further straining the capacity of the health system to meet the health care needs of the vulnerable population.\n\n\u25e6In northern Gaza, five hospitals remain partially functional, providing limited health care services to the vulnerable population: two in the northern governorate and three in Gaza City. \u25e6In the south, seven hospitals are currently operational, two in Deir al-Balah, two in Khan Younis, and three in Rafah, in addition to seven field hospitals.\n\n\u25e6Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat, in the middle governorate, was reportedly hit on 22 April, disrupting the solar energy system that supplies electricity to the hospital and causing damage to water and fuel tanks.\n\n\u2022 The planned Rafah incursion will have disastrous impact on the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe. As part of contingency efforts, WHO and partners are urgently working to restore and resuscitate health services, including through expansion of services and pre-positioning of supplies, but the broken health system would not be able to cope with a surge in casualties and deaths that a Rafah incursion would cause.\n\n\u2022 Increasing insecurity, destroyed roads infrastructure, and lack of proper facilitation of humanitarian missions continue to hinder health access. A sustained and functional deconfliction mechanism is needed to facilitate safe delivery of humanitarian aid across the Gaza Strip, as per International Humanitarian Law.\n\n\u2022 As of 30 April, medical evacuation was requested for a total of 10,051 critical patients. Out of this total, 5,643 requests were approved (56% approval rate), and 4,697 patients were successfully evacuated. The difference between approved and evacuated patients is attributed to patients passing away while awaiting approval, patients encountering access restrictions, or not being timely informed of the approved evacuation date. The number of patients requiring medical evacuation is expected to increase, considering diminished capacity of the Gazan health system to meet the exacerbated needs of the vulnerable population, in light of the ongoing emergency.\n\n\u2022 The Palestinian Civil Defense warned from disease outbreaks, with more than an estimated 10,000 people missing under rubble in the Gaza Strip. This is particularly worrisome with the rise in temperature, which can accelerate decomposition of the bodies.\n\n\u2022 Partner operations continue to be negatively affected by the displacement of staff, operational challenges, and disrupted telecommunication.\n\n\u2022 Limited access to proper WASH facilities continue to contribute to the rise in infectious disease, including diarrhoeal illness and hepatitis A. \u2022 Escalation of violence in the West Bank. Since 7 October, the MoH reported more than 492 people killed, and\n\n3 2\n---\n29 Apr 2024 Nasser Medical Complex\n\nResponse\n\n\u2022 WHO\n\n\u2022 To date, WHO has procured $24.2 million worth of health commodities, 56% of which has already been delivered to Gaza (678 metric tonnes), including essential trauma emergency supply kits (TESK), NCD and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) kits. Procurement also includes critical medications and supplies that are needed to maintain provision of essential health services.\n\n\u2022 WHO and partners continue carrying out missions supporting patient transfers, conducting needs assessment, supporting deployment of EMTs and field hospitals, and delivering food, water, and medical supplies to health facilities, across the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u2022 As part of ongoing contingency efforts, WHO, partners and hospital staff have completed the first phase of restoration of Nasser Medical Complex, including cleaning and ensuring essential equipment is functioning. The emergency ward, nine operating theaters, intensive care unit, maternity ward, neonatal intensive care unit and the outpatient department are now partly functional, and national staff alongside emergency medical teams are working there.\n\n\u2022 A large WHO warehouse has been established in Deir al Bala and a sizable volume of medical supplies has been shifted there from WHO warehouses in Rafah as they could become unreachable during the incursion. These measures will help to ensure the rapid movement of supplies to Khan Younis, Middle Area and northern Gaza when needed.\n\n\u2022 WHO is liaising with MSF to conduct a training for UNRWA healthcare workers on the basics wound management.\n\n\u2022 WHO conducted field visits to four MOH and UNRWA primary healthcare centres and four EMTs (IMC, MSF-Spain, Project Hope, and MDM-France) to assess reporting on communicable diseases, and carrying out an on-the-job training.\n\n\u2022 The updated antimicrobial use guidelines was disseminated to health partners.\n\n\u2022 WHO, in collaboration with MOH, conducted an assessment of 19 medical points (MPs) across the southern governorates, to assess their capacities to include urgent delivery services. Based on the assessment results, UNFPA will be supporting 8 MPs in Rafah, and 3 in Khanyounis, and is planning to include additional 3 MPs in the Middle area, to implement urgent delivery services.\n\n\u2022 A training was conducted at Kamal Adwan hospital for 20 health care providers, including doctor, nurses and nutritionists, on the WHO guidelines for managing severe acute malnutrition (SAM) with complications.\n\n\u2022 WHO continues its support to the severe acute malnutrition stabilization centres (SAM SC) in the Gaza Strip, and is working with the Nutrition Cluster on standardizing the guidelines for managing acute malnutrition at out-patient departments and SAM SCs. To date, 55 cases of SAM with complications were admitted to the SCs for treatment: 40 in Kamal Adwan, 8 in the IMC SC, and 7 in the Tal Al-Sultan SC (supported by MedGlobal) in Rafah.\n\n\u2022 Partners\n\n\u2022 The Health Cluster reported that 59 partners are currently operational in the Gaza Strip, reaching an average of 223,100 people with various healthcare services and supplies. A total of 188 medical points are currently operating throughout the Gaza Strip, providing essential primary health care services to the vulnerable population.\n\n\u2022 The IMC opened a new field hospital (40 beds) in Deir Al-Balah- the first in the middle area. This raises the number of functional field hospitals to seven with the Jordanian and UK-Med hospitals in Khan Younis, and the Indonesian, UAE, IMC, and Qatari field hospitals in Rafah.\n\n\u2022 MSF Belgium has successfully delivered 9 concentrators with a 10LPM capacity.\n\n4 2\n---\nWHO Mission Update\n\n21-28 April 2024\n\nUpdate on missions since 21 April:\n\n\u2022 On 22 April, WHO led a joint mission to Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals in Northern Gaza. During the mission, WHO teams assessed the health and logistics needs of the facilities, delivering critical medical supplies and 24,000L of fuel to maintain service provision. Two tents and 14 beds were delivered to Kamal Adwan to expand its bed capacity. Four patients were also successfully evacuated from Kamal Adwan to IMC field hospital in Rafah.\n\n\u2022 On 24 April, WHO led a mission to El-Helou and Al-Ahli hospitals in Northern Gaza, to assess the situation at the hospitals, and deliver critical supplies, including 24,000L of fuel. Four patients were also evacuated from Al-Ahli hospital to the IMC and UK-Med field hospitals in Rafah.\n\nWHO Recommendations\n\n\u2022 Immediate ceasefire. \u2022 Expand and sustain humanitarian access into Gaza for fuel, water, food, medicines and other necessary supplies. \u2022 Expand humanitarian corridors and ensure safe passage to allow delivery of humanitarian aid within Gaza. \u2022 Active protection of civilians and health care , preserving the function of remaining health facilities. \u2022 Establish and strengthen a routine process for medical evacuation for all patients in need, without distinction of any kind, ensuring timely referral of the +10,000 critical patients that need to be medevaced out of Gaza.\n\nFunding\n\nFurther information:\n\n\u2022 Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO oPt Representative, peeperkornr@who.int\n\n\u2022 Dr Ayadil Saparbekov, WHO oPt Emergencies Lead, asaparbekov@who.int\n\n\u2022 Bisma Akbar, WHO oPt Communication Officer, akbarb@who.int", "61504": "title: Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #163 \n content: Key Highlights\nAll key medical facilities in Rafah could soon become inaccessible or inoperable, Health Cluster partners warn, as An Najjar Hospital - one of three remaining in Rafah -was already abruptly vacated on 7 May.\nGaza Strip Updates\nIsraeli bombardment from the air, land, and sea continues to be reported across much of the Gaza Strip, resulting in further civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of houses and other civilian infrastructure.\nOn 7 May, a ground operation by the Israeli military began in eastern Rafah, including the areas of Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings as well as some 31 square kilometres where residents were ordered to evacuate on 6 May. Israeli authorities closed Kerem Shalom crossing on 5 May, following a mortar attack by Palestinian armed groups on the area, and closed Rafah Crossing for the movement of goods and people on 7 May. On 8 May, the Israeli authorities announced the re-opening of Kerem Shalom Crossing from the Israeli side. As of 8 May, Rafah crossing remains closed. The UN is engaging with stakeholders to advocate for the facilitation of the entry of fuel and other supplies through all routes into and within the Gaza Strip. In a press briefing on 7 May, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres stated: \u201cI am disturbed and distressed by the renewed military activity in Rafah,\u201d warning that a full-scale assault on Rafah, the epicentre of the humanitarian operation, would be catastrophic and cripple all efforts to deliver critical assistance to the population. The UN Chief stressed the imperative to protect civilians whether they stay in Rafah or leave and emphasized Israel\u2019s obligation to facilitate safe and unimpeded humanitarian access into and across Gaza.\nBetween the afternoons of 6 and 8 May, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, 109 Palestinians were killed and 296 injured, including 55 killed and 200 injured in the last 24 hours. Between 7 October 2023 and 8 May 2024, at least 34,844 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and 78,404 Palestinians were injured, according to MoH in Gaza.\nThe following are among the deadly incidents between 5 and 7 May: On 5 May, at about 17:20, nine Palestinians, including at least four children and two women, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Yebna Refugee Camp in southeastern Rafah.\nOn 5 May, at about 22:50, nine Palestinians, including four children and three women, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit on George Street in eastern Rafah.\nOn 6 May, at about 1:50, four Palestinians, including two children and two women, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Al Junainah neighbourhood in eastern Rafah.\nOn 7 May, at about 0:20, at least five Palestinians, including a woman and a child, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Al Barahma neighbourhood in Tal As Sultan area in western Rafah.\nOn 7 May, at about 2:15, four Palestinians, including one woman, were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Al Junainah neighbourhood in eastern Rafah.\nOn 7 May at about 4:00, four Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when two apartments were hit in Tal As Sultan area in western Rafah.\nBetween the afternoons of 6 May and 8 May, no Israeli soldiers were reported killed in Gaza. As of 8 May, 266 soldiers have been killed and 1,610 soldiers have been injured in Gaza or along the border in Israel since the beginning of the ground operation, according to the Israeli military. In addition, according to the Israeli media citing official Israeli sources, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 33 children, have been killed in Israel, the vast majority on 7 October. As of 8 May, it is estimated that that 132 Israelis and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, including fatalities whose bodies are withheld.\nSince 6 May, tens of thousands of people, many of whom have already been displaced multiple times, have been forced to leave Rafah governorate in search of increasingly limited options for safety. Monitoring of population movements shows that people have primarily moved to Khan Younis and Deir Al Balah using vehicles, trucks and donkey carts through the three main roads connecting Rafah and Khan Younis: Salah Ad Deen Road, the Coastal Road, and Meraj Road. UN agencies report that the few sites to which people are already relocating are without adequate latrines, water points, drainage, or shelter, but humanitarian agencies are unable to improve conditions with no fuel and other supplies coming in.\nThe continued closure of Rafah Crossing, where a daily average of 48 trucks and 166,000 litres of diesel entered Gaza between 1 and 5 May, essentially chokes off the entry of life-saving aid into Gaza and the fuel necessary for sustaining humanitarian operations and all life-critical sectors in Gaza.\nHumanitarian agencies warn that existing fuel stocks in Gaza will be depleted within days. This will have an immediate impact on all humanitarian operations, communication networks, and banking activities. If fuel provision does not resume, this would severe the ability of aid actors to dispatch and distribute existing aid stocks, gather information on humanitarian needs, and support the functioning of bakeries. The main water production facilities also risk ceasing operations without fuel. Combined with active hostilities, this would additionally bring to a halt the already limited solid waste collection and render inoperable or inaccessible the remaining sewage pumping stations. As a result, some 1,400 tons of solid waste estimated to be generated daily in southern Gaza and sewage would accumulate, exacerbating public health concerns. The ability of families to connect during displacement in case of separation would also be compromised. Since 7 October and as of 7 May, a monthly average of about two million litres of diesel and benzene entered Gaza due to restrictions imposed by Israeli authorities, a decline of about 85 per cent compared with the monthly average of 14 million litres of fuel (diesel and benzene) that entered Gaza between January and September 2023.\nThe continued block on the entry of critical humanitarian items via Rafah Crossing and continued hostilities would have serious consequences on access to food and nutrition services and render impossible improvements at existing and new displacement sites. At present, and within a context where the majority of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed and more than 75 per cent of the people have already been displaced, Shelter Cluster partners have a limited number of tents available for distribution in Gaza. There is also a lack of materials, such as tarpaulins, ropes, plastic sheeting, timber, nails, and tools to build shelters or make damaged buildings habitable. Moreover, the main warehouses of Food Security Cluster partners in Rafah have become inaccessible due to hostilities and most partners would run out of food stocks in one week. The treatment of several thousand children suffering from acute malnutrition would be interrupted and routine service delivery, including screening, case detection, referral and blanket supplementary feeding would be impacted.\nCritical medical services in Rafah have already been disrupted by the evacuation orders by the Israeli military, the ground operation in eastern Rafah, and the closure of Rafah Crossing. Health Cluster partners also warn that there is a risk that intensified military activity will soon render all main health facilities in the area inaccessible or inoperable, depriving over one million people of healthcare. The Abu Youssef An Najjar Hospital\u2014one of the three, alongside Al Kuwaiti Hospital and Al Emirati Maternity Hospital, which remained partially functioning in Rafah as of 6 May\u2014had to be abruptly vacated on 7 May as it was in the area subject to the evacuation order. The hospital\u2019s dialysis department, WHO reported, was the only one surviving in Gaza and represented a lifeline for patients suffering from kidney failure.\nThe head of Al Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah, Dr. Suhaib Al Hams, explained in video posted on 7 May that the situation at the facility was \u201ccatastrophic in every sense of the word\u201d as the hospital was facing a rising influx of casualties amid dire shortages of beds and medical staff. The doctor appealed to all medical students, trainee doctors and nursing staff in the Rafah governorate, as well as to international organizations and medical teams, to urgently help the overwhelmed facility. On 7 May, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res also reported that they had begun discharging patients able to walk from their clinic inside the Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital, and were also preparing for a potential medical evacuation. In the same way, Project HOPE highlighted that it had been forced to close its medical unit in Ash Shouka, which was in the evacuation zone, while operating hours had been reduced at its static clinic in Jafar At Tayyar displacement site, as medical personnel needed to leave to prepare for potential further evacuations. Surgical staff due to enter Gaza to support Kamal Adwan Hospital were also denied entry due to the closure of Rafah Crossing, Project HOPE reported. Meanwhile, in a press release, the Ministry of Health warned that 140 injured and sick patients, alongside their companions, who had to be medically evacuated on 7 May were unable to leave Gaza. The Ministry also stressed that no medicines, supplies or fuel necessary to sustain hospital operations were entering Rafah.\nMany of the over 600,000 children crammed in Rafah are already \u201chighly vulnerable and at the edge of survival\u201d and a ground incursion would expose them to catastrophic risks, reiterated UNICEF. About 65,000 children in Gaza\u2019s southernmost area are estimated to have a disability, 90 per cent of children under five are suffering from one or more infectious diseases, and nearly 8,000 infants under the age of two are already acutely malnourished, UNICEF estimates. The Health Cluster has warned that there is a shortage of vaccines for routine immunization in Gaza; unless the entry of these critical supplies urgently restarts, immunization rates among children could decrease, heightening the risk of preventable disease outbreaks. Forced displacement and an expanded ground incursion in Rafah would further curtail children\u2019s access to water, food and vital medical care and would rapidly increase the number of unaccompanied and separated children, while the ability of humanitarian actors to provide them with basic support would be heavily reduced.", "62096": "title: Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #162 [EN/HE] \n content: The OCHA oPt Flash Update is published every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with a comprehensive update on the West Bank included every Wednesday.

One fundamental way to do this is to allow civilians to leave for safer areas. But civilians must have enough time to leave, as well as a safe route and place to go. Importantly, displaced civilians' basic needs must be met, and they must be allowed to return as soon as the circumstances allow. The United Nations is not taking part in involuntary evacuations or in the setting up of any displacement zones in southern Gaza. Humanitarian actors are committed to stay and deliver and stand ready to bring assistance to people in need, wherever they are.\nBetween the afternoons of 3 and 6 May, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, 113 Palestinians were killed and 241 injured, including 52 killed and 90 injured in the last 24 hours. Between 7 October 2023 and 6 May 2024, at least 34,735 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and 78,108 Palestinians were injured, according to MoH in Gaza.\nThe following are among the deadly incidents between 2 and 5 May: On 2 May, at about 12:45, six Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a residential building was hit in Ash Sheikh Radwan area, in northwestern Gaza city. On 2 May, at about 16:00, four Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when Bloc 4 of Al Bureij Refugee Camp was hit. On 2 May, at about 18:00, two Palestinian men were reportedly killed when a house was hit in As-Salam neighbourhood in southwestern Rafah. On 3 May, at 2:25, seven Palestinians, including five children and a woman, were reportedly killed when a house was hit in northern Rafah. On 3 May, at about 23:50, at least three Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a residential building was hit in As Saftawi area west of Jabaliya town. On 4 May, at about 13:40, two Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a house was hit in Abu Halawa area in eastern Rafah.\nBetween the afternoons of 3 May and 6 May, four Israeli soldiers were reported killed in Israel near Kerem Shalom crossing in an attack by Palestinian armed groups. Subsequently, the Israeli authorities announced the temporary closure of the crossing. As of 6 May, 266 soldiers have been killed and 1,610 soldiers have been injured in Gaza or along the border in Israel since the beginning of the ground operation, according to the Israeli military. In addition, according to the Israeli media citing official Israeli sources, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 33 children, have been killed in Israel, the vast majority on 7 October. According to Israeli media sources, the remains of a security guard who was presumed a hostage were found in the tomb of another security guard. As of 6 May, it is estimated that that 132 Israelis and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, including fatalities whose bodies are withheld. On 2 May, Kibbutz Be'eri announced that a community member held hostage in Gaza was killed on 7 October and his body is being withheld in Gaza.\nOn 6 May, the Israeli military ordered the residents of nine blocs in eastern Rafah to \"temporarily move\" to a so-called \"expanded humanitarian area\" in Al Mawassi. The area slated for evacuation is about 31 square kilometres and includes Al Shokat municipality area, As Salam neighbourhood, Al Juneineh, Tal Azar'a and Al Bayuk. This area was home to some 64,000 Palestinians prior to 7 October and currently encompasses nine sites hosting internally displaced persons (IDPs), three clinics, and six warehouses. With today's evacuation orders, 277 square kilometres or about 76 per cent of the Gaza Strip have been placed under evacuation orders; this includes all areas north of Wadi Gaza, whose residents were ordered to evacuate in late October, as well as specific areas south of Wadi Gaza slated for evacuation by the Israeli military since 1 December.\nIn a joint statement issued on 3 May, the oPt and Global Protection Cluster stated that a potential incursion in Rafah would make the already catastrophic situation \"impossible,\" even \"unthinkable,\" warning that \"the repeated displacement of people, the staggering loss of life -- specifically of women and children -- and the strain placed by the infrastructural and economic decimation of Gaza\" have already stretched \"any sense of community and individual resilience to its absolute breaking point.\" Only an immediate ceasefire and the urgent scale up of humanitarian access into Gaza, particularly via land crossings, would prevent further harm to civilians, underscored the Cluster.\nOn 3 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that a full-scale operation could lead to a \"bloodbath,\" substantially increasing mortality and morbidity and further crippling \"an already broken health system.\" This would compromise the functionality or overwhelm the capacity of the seven partially functioning hospitals in southern Gaza, including three in Rafah. According to WHO, An Najjar and Al Emirati hospitals, which provide vital dialysis and maternal health services, as well as Kuwaiti Hospital, all in Rafah, could quickly become non-functional. WHO also cautioned that the European Hospital in Khan Younis, which currently serves as a third-level referral centre for critical patients, may also become unreachable. Another partially functioning hospital in Khan Younis is Nasser Medical Complex, which has resumed partial operations following the completion of the first phase of restoration by Health Cluster partners, including the hospital's emergency and maternity wards, nine operating theatres, the ICU and neonatal ICU, and the outpatient department. Work is also ongoing to resupply and expand services at key hospitals in northern Gaza, and to establish additional primary health centres and medical points in Khan Younis, Deir al Balah and northern Gaza, with supplies being prepositioned as part of contingency efforts to enable these facilities to treat diseases and manage trauma patients. Yet, all these efforts are just \"band aid,\" stressed the WHO Representative in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), Rik Peeperkorn, warning that this will in no way prevent the new scale of death, disease and displacement that an incursion would cause.\nOn 4 May, the Municipality of An Nusseirat issued a statement that details the level of incurred damage in An Nuseirat since the onset of hostilities. According to the municipality, about 27,000 square metres of roads, five main squares and intersections, 12 water wells, about 4,250 linear meters of water networks, 15 water valves, and two desalination plants have been destroyed. Ten power generators and six solar energy systems serving municipal facilities also sustained damage. Moreover, due to fuel shortages, the destruction of municipal vehicles and sewage networks and access limitations, about 22,000 tons of waste have accumulated in the streets and around IDP shelters. The lack of fuel has also undermined the functionality of water wells and sewage treatment plants, resulting in sewage overflow in some streets. The municipality called on international institutions to provide urgent support, including facilitating the entry of fuel, heavy machinery, and spare parts to repair sewage and water lines. According to the Union of Gaza Strip Municipalities, about 270,000 tons of solid waste have accumulated across the Gaza Strip, creating an environmental and public health catastrophe. According to the WASH Cluster, the inability to access official solid waste landfills in Gaza, particularly Sofa Landfill, has hindered the safe transfer of solid waste from contaminated, temporary dumpsites.\nWest Bank Update\nOn 4 May, the Israeli military carried out a 16-hour military operation in Deir al Ghusun village near Tulkarm city. During the operation, heavy forces supported by a military bulldozer surrounded a residential building and exchanged fire with Palestinians. According to human rights organizations, citing eyewitnesses, the house was hit by at least 30 air strikes, ground missiles and bombs. Israeli forces pulled out and withheld the bodies of four Palestinians and informed Palestinian authorities of their identities. A fifth fatality was found headless under rubble, according to the Ministry of Health, and his identity remains unclear. Initial information indicates that three families comprising 19 people, including 13 children, have been displaced. An assessment by the UN and its partners is underway.\nAn operation carried out by Israeli forces and fighting between Israeli forces and armed Palestinians are taking place in Tulkarm city and its refugee camps, as of the time of writing on 6 May. Initial reports indicate that Israeli forces have bulldozed multiple streets in Tulkarm Refugee Camp, resulting in extensive infrastructural damage and cutting off the water and electricity supplies and internet services. Schools in Tulkarm have also closed and movement from and to the area remains severely restricted. Israeli forces reportedly impeded access to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) teams, and some of its volunteers were trapped in a house for several hours.\nFunding\nOn 17 April, the Humanitarian Country Team released a new Flash Appeal for the oPt, which requests $2.8 billion to meet the most critical needs of 2.3 million people in Gaza and 800,000 people in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between April and December 2024.\nThe oPt HF has 118 ongoing projects, for a total of $72.5 million, addressing urgent needs in the Gaza Strip (85 per cent) and West Bank (15 per cent). In light of the updated Flash Appeal, the HF has allocated an additional $22 million to bolster prioritized HF-funded projects in Gaza. Since 7 October, the oPt HF has mobilized $90 million from Member States and private donors, designated for programmes throughout Gaza. A summary of the oPt HF activities and challenges in March 2024 is available through this link and the 2023 Annual report of the oPt HF can be accessed here. Private donations are collected directly through the Humanitarian Fund.\nFor the Gaza Humanitarian Response Update for the period between 29 April and 5 May, please visit: Gaza Humanitarian Response Update | 29 April--5 May 2024. It is updated throughout the week to reflect new content.", "62871": "title: Targeting: 1. What are the current selection criteria followed for selecting MPCA beneficiaries in Gaza? \n content: Targeting: 1. What are the current selection criteria followed for selecting MPCA beneficiaries in Gaza?\n\nAgreements for targeting for EMPCA response has evolved over time, leaving flexibility for single organisations to apply specific criteria where needed for internal mandates and strategies. Initial focus was put on IDPs outside UNRWA shelters, as those hosted in DES had access to some level of humanitarian assistance. Following the increase in the number of people moving across shelters and facing multiple rounds of displacement, the group agreed to drop the eligibility criteria of \u201coutside UNRWA DES\u201d, due to the impossibility of verifying the information for all cases. Currently, considering 85% of the Gaza population is internally displaced, EMPCA is delivered through a blanket approach. Single agencies apply specific criteria, most notably, for those identifying cases through the National Social Registry (NSR), pre-crisis socioeconomic vulnerability is the primary criteria for inclusion.\n\nIn the new strategy (Flash Appeal 2024) vulnerability-based targeting is being increasingly considered. One of the main challenges is the lack of up-to-date information to base the targeting on.\n\n2.\n\nHow do the partners currently do the geographical targeting (if any)?\n\nNo geographical targeting is happening. On the contrary, thanks to the widespread presence of cash- out agents and their capacity to keep working when displaced, cash has been one of the few assistances to continuously cover the whole Gaza Strip \u2013 maximising flexibility for beneficiaries (often on the move between different rounds of displacement) to cash out when and where they want/can/prefer.\n\n3.\n\nIs blanket targeting really possible when funding is far below needs?\n\nA balance needs to be achieved between what is needed, i.e. covering everyone, and what is possible based on available information, but also based on the operational limitations on the ground, e.g. the liquidity, telecoms, single FSP working, etc.\n\nAdditionally, it must be considered that MPCA is delivered at a household level, in a context where multiple households share shelters and resources, effectively amplifying the reach of the assistance.\n\nMarket: 1. Can the informal market absorb and meet the increasing demand?\n\nThe problem is the availability of goods, which almost entirely depends on the number of trucks entering from outside. Informal markets are a result of the collapse of formal markets due to infrastructure damage, disruption of private sector supply chains, telecoms cut, and security concerns for static spaces \u2013 but the origin of the goods to be sold is the same.\n---\nDuplication:\n\n2.\n\nHas there been any thoughts to using cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to solve some of the challenges?\n\nSome initial brainstorming involving cutting-edge technology options took place \u2013 to be further considered in the future.\n\n3.\n\nHow was the deduplication done? any digital solutions used or was it done manually?\n\nIt has been done manually by a dedicated IM officer so far, who received lists from authorities and partners and deduplicated them to obtain an MPCA master-list. Currently, an IT system is being developed to strengthen the process.\n\n4.\n\nWith regards to duplication, how do you ensure the data privacy of aid recipients, while using Excel? Are you using unique identifiers to avoid sharing personal information?\n\nThe unique identifier used for deduplication is the national ID number of the head of household and \u2013 where available \u2013 the spouse. Data protection has been a gap in the response, especially at the beginning. Data were shared from a central point which was represented by CWG/OCHA. Password protection sheet started being used as well to allow some basic level of protection.\n\nFSP: 5.\n\nHow do PalPay agents access cash themselves for payouts? through that increased cap on ATMs withdrawal for the agents? Since there is an issue with cash movement, is it till the ATMs have liquidity for payout?\n\nPalPay agents need to have a Bank of Palestine (BoP) account (a requirement to become PalPay agents), and through that access cash through ATMs. The withdrawal limit for agents was raised to 10,000 USD (roughly 37,000 NIS) right after the outbreak of the conflict. BoP managed to refill ATMs, especially in the south, for the first four/five months of the crisis. Currently, only a few are still in operation, and agents are reportedly accessing cash through other channels. 6. It seems that more and more big vendors are acting as Hawalla, did the CWG assess the possibility of relying on this informal mechanism in addition or completion of palpay? Cash agents provide different PalPay services, including private transfers and cash out through PalPay digital wallets (for those with pre-existing wallets) and through BoP ATM cards (through PoS machines). For the purpose and scale of humanitarian cash, the cardless PIN code option is the only viable one at the moment. Hawalla per se was never used for major CVA programmes in Gaza. 7. With the current challenges of liquidity and the fact that we are depending on only one service provider, considering the scale and duration of the response, has there been any chance to add more FSPs or expand the FSP mapping to add more, if not now, later on when things are settled?\n---\nThe pre-crisis situation already featured an increase convergence towards BoP and PalPay services beyond PIN codes \u2013 including ATM cards, cash over the counter, and vouchers. Other FSPs were contacted during the crisis but are not able to work at the moment. In the past few days, JawwalPay, a local digital payment solution company reportedly has resumed some level of work \u2013 and is currently being assessed by cash actors.\n\n8. 9.\n\nThere was a report on PalPay agents discriminating or refusing to pay out and that humanitarian partners were considering increasing % the fee for agents as an incentive for payout; In addition, can you explain the current situation and the challenges when it comes to PalPay agents and delivery mechanism? What is the percentage of fees that NGOs incur for cash transfer transactions?\n\nReports of PalPay agents collecting illegal fees from cash recipients (not only humanitarian) have increased in the past months. Agents cited the increased risks they face to keep operations running, and the challenges in accessing cash, as the reason for requesting extra fees. While in a normal situation, the practice of illegal fee collection would have constituted grounds for immediate termination of the contract between the agent and PalPay, the current conditions (only one-fourth of agents working) force a more prudent analysis before the termination of any agent, which might result in the impossibility to assist parts of the population in different areas. PalPay agents get 2 NIS per transaction as a fee from PalPay \u2013 regardless of the amount transferred.\n\nSome CWG agencies agreed to tackle to issue by negotiating with PalPay an increase in the fees paid by the delivering agency to allow PalPay to pay higher fees to the agents. This is coupled with clear accountability and compliance measures for agents who persist in this illicit practice. The agreement entered into force on the 01st of May for a period of three months, after which the results will be assessed to decide on the next steps.\n\nLiquidity:\n\n10. Could you elaborate on what the liquidity challenges of the past few weeks have been and expectations of whether they might improve/worsen? 11. Regarding liquidity could you give more details? Is only paper cash used or people can also make electronic payments?\n\nThe main challenge is the inability of banks, primarily Bank of Palestine, to transfer cash from Gaza to the south, between branches, and in ATMs. This has increasingly been creating problems in the south, especially in Rafah, where the population has quintuplicated since October. This key challenge is coupled with reported losses of liquidity due to theft, confiscation by the Israeli army, damage due to conflict, and lack of deposits from major traders into working banks in the past couple of months. Suggestions to bring cash from the West Bank have been disregarded by the Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA) in Ramallah citing risks of affecting fiscal stability in OPT.\n---\nThe issue of liquidity has been escalated at the highest levels of humanitarian management in the country, with the involvement of Palestinian authorities; however, the situation is expected to worsen in the short period unless major conditions shift, e.g. ceasefire.\n\n(Expansion of) electronic payments is currently being considered by the PMA. However, it must be noticed that the needed telecommunication and technology infrastructure in Gaza was already very weak before the crisis, and has been massively impacted by the conflict, raising a lot of questions on the feasibility of the plan.\n\nGeneral:\n\n12. A number of cash actors are not currently operational in Gaza and are having internal discussions on whether to initiate a cash response, how a response might look like, is there an added advantage that can be made etc. Given noted challenges with movement of cash, volatility of the informal market, limited options for FSPs etc. what would be your advice to such agencies?\n\nIn terms of comparative advantage for MPCA: be ready for the day after, when more and larger distribution will be needed and feasible. For now, try finding your pocket with \"sectoral cash\", where you can make a difference.\n\n13. For new INGOs entering Gaza response. Do we have a good understanding of the gap in the cash intervention? and if there is a need for a large-scale cash response?\n\nLarge scale responses are simply not feasible now (though they would be much needed!) due to the FPS capacity, liquidity, and market challenges. 14. Are other cash modalities being implemented besides MPCA?\n\nSome cash for work is ongoing (the CWG developed specific guidelines for this), and there were examples of urgent cash for detainees released at the crossing by Israeli forces. 15. Do you think cash is a good option for the Gaza response?\n\nYes. Despite all the challenges, cash remains a necessary option in Gaza, where the entire population is in need of multisectoral assistance, but where in-kind is insufficient and unable to be distributed everywhere. Cash acts as an equalizer, allowing those not receiving sufficient in-kind assistance, or not receiving it at all, to access life-saving goods and services through existing markets.\n\nAid diversion:\n\n16. How do you ensure that cash-redeemed assistance does not get misused or re-routed for other political means to non-targeted parties...to further reassure donors that cash aid is safe and effective to sponsor?\n\nDistributed assistance is in the form of unrestricted cash assistance (Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance), which provides recipients with full flexibility to prioritize assistance as they see fit. From\n---\nPDM data, food is the biggest expenditure for all recipients, followed by drinking water, medicines, bedding, and debt repayments.\n\nCash has been proved multiple times to be not riskier than other forms of assistance.\n\n17. How does PalPay, Bank of Palestine, and MoSD deal with the concerns of diversion of aid, and mitigation measures put in place to ensure continuity of MPCA? 18. How do you maintain transparency and accountability in fund distribution, and what systems are in place to prevent fraud and corruption? What have been some of the key lessons learned from operating cash assistance programmes in such a complex environment?\n\nAhead of distributions, PalPay requires organizations to share the full names of each recipient in English, in addition to other information needed to implement the disbursement, and runs checks through their Compliance and Anti-Money Laundering (CAML) department. As part of standard banking practices, each name included in the distribution lists is checked against sanctions lists of the EU, France, Israel, the UN, and the US.\n\nIn the case of suspected matches, the CAML department requests extra information about the potential recipient, including a copy of their national ID, in order to perform extra controls. If the potential recipient is confirmed to be included in sanction lists, PalPay informs the organization and does not perform any transaction to the individual.\n\nPalPay employs a robust double verification system to ensure the secure distribution of funds to recipients. When beneficiaries are registered, they receive a unique verification code via SMS. Cash- out agents, who are responsible for distributing the funds, have a list of recipients with their names, IDs, and verification codes. When recipients wish to withdraw money, they are required to present their personal identification and the verification code. The cash-out agent verifies this information to ensure that the funds are going to the correct recipient.\n\nEach MPCA organisations have access to a PalPay platform/dashboard which allows access to transaction data such us: how much money has been withdrawn by the designated recipient; when it has been withdrawn; and at which PalPay official vendor.\n\nNames received from MoSD from the National Social Registry (NSR) have all been vetted by the EU prior to the crisis.", "63230": "title: Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #164 \n content: The OCHA oPt Flash Update is published every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with a comprehensive update on the West Bank included every Wednesday. The next update will be issued on 13 May.\nKey Highlights\nOver 100,000 people already displaced from Rafah are facing dire shortages of shelter, food, water and sanitation services.\nUnless fuel is immediately allowed into Gaza, five hospitals, five field hospitals, 28 ambulances, 23 medical points and 17 primary health care centres will only be able to sustain operations for less than 48 hours, warns the Health Cluster.\nEight WFP-supported bakeries in southern Gaza have already ceased operations and four will run out of fuel and supplies in three days.\nGaza Strip Updates\nIsraeli bombardment from the air, land, and sea continues to be reported across much of the Gaza Strip, resulting in further civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of houses and other civilian infrastructure. Ground incursions and heavy fighting also continue to be reported south of Gaza city and in eastern Rafah, including the area of Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings. Rafah Crossing remains closed since 7 May. On 8 May, OCHA, UNRWA, UN Mine Action Service, and the UN Department of Safety and Security carried out a security assessment at both crossings, which remain heavily militarized. \u201cThe closure of the crossings means no fuel. It means no trucks, no generators, no water, no electricity and no movement of people or goods. It means no aid\u2026Civilians in Gaza are being starved and killed and we are prevented from helping them,\u201d stated Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths.\nBetween the afternoons of 8 and 9 May, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, 60 Palestinians were killed and 110 injured. Between 7 October 2023 and 9 May 2024, at least 34,904 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and 78,514 Palestinians were injured, according to MoH in Gaza. Casualty numbers covering the period until the afternoon of 10 May are not available as of the time of reporting.\nThe following are among the deadly incidents on 7 and 8 May: On 7 May, at about 15:35, two Palestinian boys were reportedly killed and 17 injured when a house was hit in southern Rafah. On 7 May, at about 23:00, seven Palestinians were reportedly killed and 14 injured when a house sheltering internally displaced persons (IDPs), in Az Zaytoun neighbourhood southeast of Gaza city, was hit. On 8 May, at about 20:25, five Palestinians were reportedly killed and 16 injured when a house was hit in Tall as Sultan area in western Rafah. On 8 May, at about 17:50, 13 Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a dental clinic was hit in Shawa Square, east of Gaza city. On 8 May, at about 17:50, 11 Palestinians, including four children, were reportedly killed and others injured when the vicinity of Al Ibki Mosque in At Tuffah neighbourhood, east of Gaza city, was hit.\nBetween the afternoons of 8 May and 10 May, no Israeli soldiers were reported killed in Gaza. As of 10 May, 266 soldiers have been killed and 1,610 soldiers have been injured in Gaza or along the border in Israel since the beginning of the ground operation, according to the Israeli military. In addition, according to the Israeli media citing official Israeli sources, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 33 children, have been killed in Israel, the vast majority on 7 October. As of 10 May, it is estimated that that 132 Israelis and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, including fatalities whose bodies are withheld.\nIn a statement issued on 8 May, the Government Media Office (GMO) announced that a third mass grave had been discovered inside Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza city and that 49 bodies had already been recovered as exhumation efforts continued. The statement added that, with this latest discovery, the number of mass graves found inside Gaza\u2019s hospitals had risen to seven - three at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza, three at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, and one in Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza - with 520 bodies recovered in total. On 7 May, responding to a media question on this subject in Geneva, OHCHR spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani indicated that \u201cit is clear that mass graves exist\u201d and reiterated the call for an independent investigation to establish the circumstances in which individuals were killed.\nSince 6 May, UNRWA estimates that some 110,00 people have so far been displaced from Rafah and sought refuge in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah using vehicles, trucks, motorbikes and donkey carts. Reports further indicate that some IDPs have paid NIS1,500-2,000 in transportation fees. Amid a dire shortage of tents available on the market or in stocks of Shelter Cluster partners to support newly arriving IDPs, families have been carrying food items and personal belongings and setting up tents and makeshift shelters on the rubble of destroyed buildings and other places, including in southern Al Mawasi, or moving into empty UNRWA schools in Khan Younis. Multiple informal displacement sites have emerged, particularly south and west of Deir al Balah and west of An Nuseirat Refugee Camp. These areas lack infrastructure and basic services needed to support people\u2019s access to food, water and health care. Fuel shortages continue to hinder the ability of aid actors to address priority needs of IDPs, including shelter, food, water, non-food and hygiene items, and sanitation facilities.\nThe closure of Rafah Crossing has abruptly halted all medical evacuations of critically ill and injured patients outside Gaza. In a statement issued on 9 May, the Government Media Office indicated that 159 critical patients, including cancer cases, were prevented from leaving Gaza to receive treatment abroad since 7 May. According to the Health Cluster, prior to the Rafah Crossing\u2019s closure, only 58 per cent of patients for whom medical evacuations were requested had been approved by Israeli authorities (5,857 out of 10,175) and, out of all approved patients, 83 per cent could be evacuated outside Gaza (4,843). The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners have also been forced to stop evacuations of patients from northern to southern Gaza due to dire shortages of fuel and increasingly shrinking bed capacity at health facilities in the south.\nThe Health Cluster warns that, unless fuel is immediately allowed into Gaza, five hospitals and five field hospitals across the Strip will only be able to sustain operations for less than 48 hours. Similarly affected are 28 ambulances, 17 primary health care centres, 23 medical facilities in Al Mawasi, and ten mobile clinics that provide immunizations, trauma care and nutrition services. Without fuel to run generators, there is a critical risk of losing patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU), including newborns in neonatal ICUs, trauma patients requiring emergency surgeries and pregnant women in need of caesarian sections (C-sections). Furthermore, patients suffering from kidney failure would be deprived of vital hemodialysis treatment. Following the evacuation of An Najjar hospital in eastern Rafah on 7 May, 1,500 patients with kidney failure who previously received treatment at the hospital\u2019s hemodialysis department have been left with limited options that are also subject to fuel availability. At Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, 25 dialysis machines have been installed and are serving 60 patients as of 9 May while additional hemodialysis capacity has been reportedly available at Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al Balah. The lack of fuel would additionally disrupt the disinfection and sterilization of surgical equipment in hospitals and severely impact referral pathways for patients, the Health Cluster added. The immediate resumption of fuel supply into Gaza is an urgent priority to keep alive what remains of Gaza\u2019s decimated health system, with life-saving health services hanging by a thread.\nFollowing the evacuation of An Najjar Hospital, critical patients were transferred to the Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital and Al Kuwaiti Hospital has become the main hospital in Rafah able to provide emergency care, trauma stabilization and patient referrals, subject to fuel availability. With a 36-bed capacity and two Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) deployed on site, Al Kuwaiti Hospital, alongside two out of four other field hospitals in Rafah, could also potentially provide maternal services to pregnant women should Al Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah become inaccessible or inoperable due to the Israeli ground incursion, according to the Health Cluster. In April, UNFPA stationed a 40-foot mobile maternity unit at Al Mawasi Field Hospital operated by the International Medical Corps (IMC); the unit has laboratory equipment and two tents equipped with supplies for both normal deliveries and the management of obstetric complications, including surgical capacity for C-sections and blood transfusions. Two additional mobile maternity units supplied by UNFPA remain stuck at the border, according to WHO. In Deir al Balah, both Al Awda Hospital and the new IMC field hospital are providing maternity services, while in Khan Younis, the recently restored Nasser Medical Complex includes an operational maternity and neonatal ward, added WHO. On 8 May, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res reported that it was suspending its activities at Al-Shaboura Clinic, an important health post where over 8,200 consultations had been provided in April alone, and was handing over its activities at Al Emirati Hospital to the Ministry of Health, relocating its staff to Nasser Medical Complex to \u201ccontinue to support maternity services in a safer area.\u201d\nIn Khan Younis, the European Gaza Hospital remained accessible as of 9 May and, with support from two embedded EMTs, continued to provide CT scans, neurosurgery and to operate an ICU and burn unit. Overall, 19 EMTs coordinated by WHO continue to operate in five hospitals and seven field hospitals across Gaza, but EMT personnel rotations have not been possible since 7 May due to the closure of Rafah Crossing, lack of fuel and movement challenges. The entry of all medical supplies has similarly stopped since 7 May. In late April, WHO secured a new large warehouse in Deir al Balah and relocated there a sizable volume of medical supplies from its warehouses in Rafah, anticipating that they could become unreachable in the case of an Israeli ground incursion. However, unless the entry of medical supplies via crossings resumes, the Health Cluster assesses that existing stocks will last for approximately three weeks, depending on the number of casualties that the health system will have to absorb in the coming days.\nThe stocks of critical aid supplies, including food and fuel, continue to rapidly dwindle for the fourth consecutive day due to the closure of Rafah Crossing and the lack of safe and logistically viable access to Kerem Shalom Crossing. The World Food Programme (WFP) stressed that current supplies of food and fuel will only last a few days, as the agency\u2019s main warehouse in eastern Rafah has become inaccessible. Without them, WFP warned, \u201coperations will go to a standstill,\u201d undermining recent improvements and the sustainability of humanitarian services. In addition, on 7 May 2024, a security incident occurred at the Logistics Cluster common storage facility in eastern Rafah due to active hostilities, likely resulting in damage or loss of aid commodities in common storage. The warehouse remains inaccessible and will be assessed once security conditions allow. As of 10 May, eight out of 12 bakeries supported by humanitarian partners in southern Gaza have already ceased operations and the remaining four in Deir al Balah and Rafah are currently operating at a reduced capacity and will run out of fuel and supplies in three days. In northern Gaza, the four operational bakeries have one week of supplies available for bread production.\nDespite rising humanitarian needs, access constraints continue to significantly hinder the ability of humanitarian actors to reach people in need, particularly in northern Gaza. Between 1 and 9 May, nine out of 32 humanitarian aid missions (28 percent) to northern Gaza were facilitated by Israeli authorities, 5 (16 percent) were denied, 11 (34 percent) were impeded, and 7 (22 percent) were cancelled due to logistical constraints. Moreover, 25 out of 46 aid missions (54 percent) to areas in southern Gaza that require coordination were facilitated by the Israeli authorities, 9 (20 percent) were denied, 3 (6 percent) were impeded, and 9 (20 percent) were cancelled due to logistical constraints.\nFunding\nAs of 10 May, Member States have disbursed about US$744 million out of $3.4 billion (22 per cent) requested to meet the most critical needs of 2.3 million people in Gaza and 800,000 people in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between January and December 2024. This includes about $623 million out of $600 million (104 per cent) requested for January-March 2024 and $121 million out of $2.8 billion (4 percent) for the new Flash Appeal launched on 17 April to cover the period between April and December 2024. For funding analysis, please see the Flash Appeal Financial Tracking dashboard.\nThe oPt HF has 118 ongoing projects, for a total of $72.5 million, addressing urgent needs in the Gaza Strip (85 per cent) and West Bank (15 per cent). In light of the updated Flash Appeal, the HF has allocated an additional $22 million to bolster prioritized HF-funded projects in Gaza. Since 7 October, the oPt HF has mobilized $90 million from Member States and private donors, designated for programmes throughout Gaza.

The next update will be issued on 13 May.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nOver 100,000 people already displaced from Rafah are facing dire shortages of shelter, food, water and sanitation services. Unless fuel is immediately allowed into Gaza, five hospitals, five field hospitals, 28 ambulances, 23 medical points and 17 primary health care centres will only be able to sustain operations for less than 48 hours, warns the Health Cluster.\n\nEight WFP-supported bakeries in southern Gaza have already ceased operations and four will run out of fuel and supplies in three days.\n\nGaza Strip Updates\n\nIsraeli bombardment from the air, land, and sea continues to be reported across much of the Gaza Strip, resulting in further civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of houses and other civilian infrastructure. Ground incursions and heavy fighting also continue to be reported south of Gaza city and in eastern Rafah, including the area of Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings. Rafah Crossing remains closed since 7 May. On 8 May, OCHA, UNRWA, UN Mine Action Service, and the UN Department of Safety and Security carried out a security assessment at both crossings, which remain heavily militarized. \u201cThe closure of the crossings means no fuel. It means no trucks, no generators, no water, no electricity and no movement of people or goods. It means no aid\u2026 Civilians in Gaza are being starved and killed and we are prevented from helping them,\u201d stated Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths.\n\nBetween the afternoons of 8 and 9 May, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, 60 Palestinians were killed and 110 injured. Between 7 October 2023 and 9 May 2024, at least 34,904Palestinians were killed in Gaza and 78,514 Palestinians were injured, according to MoH in Gaza. Casualty numbers covering the period until the afternoon of 10 May are not available as of the time of reporting.\n\nThe following are among the deadly incidents on 7 and 8 May: On 7 May, at about 15:35, two Palestinian boys were reportedly killed and 17 injured when a house was hit in southern Rafah.\n\nOn 7 May, at about 23:00, seven Palestinians were reportedly killed and 14 injured when a house sheltering internally displaced persons (IDPs), in Az Zaytoun neighbourhood southeast of Gaza city, was hit.\n\nOn 8 May, at about 20:25, five Palestinians were reportedly killed and 16 injured when a house was hit in Tall as Sultan area in western Rafah.\n\nOn 8 May, at about 17:50, 13 Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured when a dental clinic was hit in Shawa Square, east of Gaza city. https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-164\n\n1/4\n---\n5/10/24, 11:25 AM\n\nHostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #164 | United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - occupied Palestinian territory\n\nOn 8 May, at about 17:50, 11 Palestinians, including four children, were reportedly killed and others injured when the vicinity of Al Ibki Mosque in At Tuffah neighbourhood, east of Gaza city, was hit.\n\nBetween the afternoons of 8 May and 10 May, no Israeli soldiers were reported killed in Gaza. As of 10 May, 266 soldiers have been killed and 1,610 soldiers have been injured in Gaza or along the border in Israel since the beginning of the ground operation, according to the Israeli military. In addition, according to the Israeli media citing official Israeli sources, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 33 children, have been killed in Israel, the vast majority on 7 October. As of 10 May, it is estimated that that 132 Israelis and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, including fatalities whose bodies are withheld.\n\nIn a statement issued on 8 May, the Government Media Office (GMO) announced that a third mass grave had been discovered inside Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza city and that 49 bodies had already been recovered as exhumation efforts continued. The statement added that, with this latest discovery, the number of mass graves found inside Gaza\u2019s hospitals had risen to seven - three at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza, three at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, and one in Kamal Adwan Hospital in North Gaza - with 520 bodies recovered in total. On 7 May, responding to a media question on this subject in Geneva, OHCHR spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani indicated that \u201cit is clear that mass graves exist\u201d and reiterated the call for an independent investigation to establish the circumstances in which individuals were killed.\n\nSince 6 May, UNRWA estimates that some 110,00 people have so far been displaced from Rafah and sought refuge in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah using vehicles, trucks, motorbikes and donkey carts. Reports further indicate that some IDPs have paid NIS1,500-2,000 in transportation fees. Amid a dire shortage of tents available on the market or in stocks of Shelter Cluster partners to support newly arriving IDPs, families have been carrying food items and personal belongings and setting up tents and makeshift shelters on the rubble of destroyed buildings and other places, including in southern Al Mawasi, or moving into empty UNRWA schools in Khan Younis. Multiple informal displacement sites have emerged, particularly south and west of Deir al Balah and west of An Nuseirat Refugee Camp. These areas lack infrastructure and basic services needed to support people\u2019s access to food, water and health care. Fuel shortages continue to hinder the ability of aid actors to address priority needs of IDPs, including shelter, food, water, non-food and hygiene items, and sanitation facilities.\n\nThe closure of Rafah Crossing has abruptly halted all medical evacuations of critically ill and injured patients outside Gaza. In a statement issued on 9 May, the Government Media Office indicated that 159 critical patients, including cancer cases, were prevented from leaving Gaza to receive treatment abroad since 7 May. According to the Health Cluster, prior to the Rafah Crossing\u2019s closure, only 58 per cent of patients for whom medical evacuations were requested had been approved by Israeli authorities (5,857 out of 10,175) and, out of all approved patients, 83 per cent could be evacuated outside Gaza (4,843). The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners have also been forced to stop evacuations of patients from northern to southern Gaza due to dire shortages of fuel and increasingly shrinking bed capacity at health facilities in the south.\n\nThe Health Cluster warns that, unless fuel is immediately allowed into Gaza, five hospitals and five field hospitals across the Strip will only be able to sustain operations for less than 48 hours. Similarly affected are 28 ambulances, 17 primary health care centres, 23 medical facilities in Al Mawasi, and ten mobile clinics that provide immunizations, trauma care and nutrition services. Without fuel to run generators, there is a critical risk of losing patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU), including newborns in neonatal ICUs, trauma patients requiring emergency surgeries and pregnant women in need of caesarian sections (C-sections). Furthermore, patients suffering from kidney failure would be deprived of vital hemodialysis treatment. Following the evacuation of An Najjar hospital in eastern Rafah on 7 May, 1,500 patients with kidney failure who previously received treatment at the hospital\u2019s hemodialysis department have been left with limited options that are also subject to fuel availability. At Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, 25 dialysis machines have been installed and are serving 60 patients as of 9 May while additional hemodialysis capacity has been reportedly available at Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al Balah. The lack of fuel would additionally disrupt the disinfection and sterilization of surgical equipment in hospitals and severely impact referral pathways for patients, the Health Cluster added. The immediate resumption of fuel supply into Gaza is an urgent priority to keep alive what remains of Gaza\u2019s decimated health system, with life-saving health services hanging by a thread.\n\nFollowing the evacuation of An Najjar Hospital, critical patients were transferred to the Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital and Al Kuwaiti Hospital has become the main hospital in Rafah able to provide emergency care, trauma stabilization and patient referrals, subject to fuel availability. With a 36-bed capacity and two Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) deployed on site, Al Kuwaiti Hospital, alongside two out of four other field hospitals in Rafah, could also potentially provide maternal services to pregnant women should Al Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah become inaccessible or inoperable due to the Israeli ground incursion, according to the Health Cluster. In April, UNFPA stationed a 40-foot mobile maternity unit at Al Mawasi Field Hospital operated by the International Medical Corps (IMC); the unit has laboratory equipment and two tents equipped with supplies for both normal deliveries and the management of obstetric complications, including surgical capacity for C-sections and blood transfusions. Two additional mobile maternity units supplied by UNFPA remain stuck at the border, according to WHO. In Deir al Balah, both Al Awda Hospital and the new IMC field hospital are providing maternity services, while in Khan Younis, the recently restored Nasser Medical Complex includes an operational maternity and neonatal ward, added WHO. On 8 May, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res reported that it was suspending its activities at Al-Shaboura Clinic, an important health post where over 8,200 consultations had been provided in April alone, and was handing over its activities at Al Emirati Hospital to the Ministry of Health, relocating its staff to Nasser Medical Complex to \u201ccontinue to support maternity services in a safer area.\u201d\n\nIn Khan Younis, the European Gaza Hospital remained accessible as of 9 May and, with support from two embedded EMTs, continued to provide CT scans, neurosurgery and to operate an ICU and burn unit. Overall, 19 EMTs coordinated by WHO continue to operate in five hospitals and seven field hospitals across Gaza, but EMT personnel rotations have not been possible since 7 May due to the closure of Rafah Crossing, lack of fuel and movement challenges. The entry of all medical supplies has similarly stopped since 7 May. In late April, WHO secured a new large warehouse in Deir al Balah and relocated there a sizable volume of medical supplies from its warehouses in Rafah, anticipating that they could become unreachable in the case of an Israeli ground\n\nhttps://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-164\n\n2/4\n---\n5/10/24, 11:25 AM\n\nHostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #164 | United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - occupied Palestinian territory\n\nincursion. However, unless the entry of medical supplies via crossings resumes, the Health Cluster assesses that existing stocks will last for approximately three weeks, depending on the number of casualties that the health system will have to absorb in the coming days.\n\nThe stocks of critical aid supplies, including food and fuel, continue to rapidly dwindle for the fourth consecutive day due to the closure of Rafah Crossing and the lack of safe and logistically viable access to Kerem Shalom Crossing. The World Food Programme (WFP) stressed that current supplies of food and fuel will only last a few days, as the agency\u2019s main warehouse in eastern Rafah has become inaccessible. Without them, WFP warned, \u201coperations will go to a standstill,\u201d undermining recent improvements and the sustainability of humanitarian services. In addition, on 7 May 2024, a security incident occurred at the Logistics Cluster common storage facility in eastern Rafah due to active hostilities, likely resulting in damage or loss of aid commodities in common storage. The warehouse remains inaccessible and will be assessed once security conditions allow. As of 10 May, eight out of 12 bakeries supported by humanitarian partners in southern Gaza have already ceased operations and the remaining four in Deir al Balah and Rafah are currently operating at a reduced capacity and will run out of fuel and supplies in three days.

It\u2019s the job she\u2019s always dreamed about having. Despite all this, she says that choosing the career is one of her biggest regrets. The prospect of work has started giving her panic attacks. She has so much paperwork to do that, outside of school, she\u2019s hardly left the house for weeks. And now she\u2019s desperate to quit. Where did it all go wrong?\n\u201cBeing in the class is absolutely perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s everything else that takes over teaching, everything else on top of it, that\u2019s made me hate it.\u201d Whether it\u2019s the mountain of admin on her desk, the torrent of emails, or all the meetings and worries for children\u2019s care, it\u2019s become too much. Kate is not alone. Teaching has always been one of the most rewarding professions, but it\u2019s also one of the toughest. And it\u2019s getting worse. A November study by the mental health charity Education Support found that teacher wellbeing is at a five-year low, with stress, insomnia and burnout all rising. In 2017, 67 per cent of schoolteachers were reporting feelings of stress \u2013 by 2023, that figure had risen starkly to 78 per cent.\nThe figures get worse everywhere you turn. This year, a workforce survey of members of the NASUWT union found that some teachers had been driven to the point of suicide by the stress of the job. Among 12,000 teachers, 23 per cent reported drinking more alcohol, 12 per cent the use of or increased use of antidepressants, and 3 per cent said they had self-harmed as a result of their work. These findings prompted members to back a suicide prevention strategy for teachers at the union\u2019s annual conference in March.\nAnd teachers are \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 leaving the profession in record numbers, too. The latest workforce survey by the Department for Education found that 40,000 teachers resigned from state schools in 2021/22 \u2013 almost 9 per cent of the teaching workforce, and the highest number since it began publishing the data in 2011. If they\u2019re not actually quitting, lots of them are considering it. There is a Facebook group called \u201cLife After Teaching \u2013 Exit the Classroom and Thrive\u201d, which currently has 159,000 members and is filled with despairing posts.\nSin\u00e9ad Mc Brearty, the head of Education Support, is not surprised. Mc Brearty has seen schoolteachers in floods of tears over not being able to budget for the school\u2019s heating bill after energy prices soared following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. She\u2019s also spoken to numerous suicidal teachers and more than one who has admitted to fantasising about purposely crashing their car on the way to work, so they wouldn\u2019t have to go in. \u201cThere are a lot of people who really are just broken by this career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s such a terribly sad thing. Because they go into this job with such a clear sense of purpose, and they really are wanting to make the world a better place. They\u2019re full of vim and vigour, and they\u2019re broken by the experience of working in schools and the demand that\u2019s there. It\u2019s a tragedy, really, that we can\u2019t get that right.\u201d\nLast year\u2019s teacher strikes were the biggest in a decade \u2013 and were eventually called off after members of four education unions voted to accept the government\u2019s 6.5 per cent pay rise offer. It was a huge misconception, though, that the strikes were just about money. Yes, teacher pay is low for the work they do (salaries start at \u00a330,000), but the strikes were also over workload, staff shortages and funding for basic resources like pencils and textbooks.\nMc Brearty says that one of the key drivers of poor mental health among teachers is work-life balance. The school day may end at about 3pm, but the working day doesn\u2019t. Teachers still have reams of paperwork to do \u2013 including form-filling for safeguarding issues or students with special needs \u2013 on top of lesson planning and marking. \u201cWe have to get a grip on workload,\u201d Mc Brearty says. \u201cThe World Health Organisation has been really clear that working more than 55 hours a week is seriously damaging to your health. But many teachers are doing that \u2013 that\u2019s normal for them.\u201d Kate is contracted to work 35 hours a week at her school, but estimates that she usually ends up clocking in as many as 60. She works every night after the school day finishes and all day on Sundays. Saturdays are her one sacred day off.\nKate has started having panic attacks about her workload and drinking more than usual to cope. \u201cIt\u2019s when I\u2019m trying to relax,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I come home from school each night, at four or five o\u2019clock, I will automatically go straight to get a glass of wine as soon as I walk in the door, and I will spend an hour having two or three. When I have Sunday anxiety, I will drink a full bottle while I\u2019m doing work. It\u2019s quite embarrassing.\u201d\nBehaviour and behaviour management are key contributors to mental health issues among teachers ( Getty )\nMichael*, who recently left teaching for a different role in education outside of the classroom, can relate to the loss of work-life balance. \u201cI\u2019m really glad I was a teacher \u2013 I learned so much and the students were remarkable,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it just felt untenable, and I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I couldn\u2019t really have a personal life.\u201d The job took an emotional toll on him, too. \u201cI found the mental load of it really difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cA massive factor was that I was taking my work home with me, and not even in a physical sense. Even when I didn\u2019t have any marking to do, I\u2019d be worrying about this student or that student, or how I was going to make something work the next day in relation to a lesson.\u201d\nIt got to the stage where he would arrive at work, sit in his car and \u201cjust freeze\u201d. \u201cI understand now, through therapy, that it was a fight or flight sort of response that happens when you feel like you\u2019re in danger.\u201d One day, when he received some difficult personal news while at work, it all became too much. \u201cI was in the middle of showing the students a film and I went up to the staff room and had a panic attack. I blacked out. I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe. I went to see a colleague and I had tears down my face, and she told me to go home and just deal with the situation. I never actually went back. That was my last day, and I ended up getting signed off by my GP.\u201d\nA lot of the tasks that teachers have to do outside of school hours are what Mc Brearty calls \u201cempty work\u201d. \u201cTeachers never complain about time with the kids or doing the stuff that they are in the job to do,\u201d she says. \u201cThe issue is the empty work \u2013 producing data for some things that seem pointless. And that problem sits at the door of government because there are government requests from schools that create workload. And it\u2019s also linked to the accountability system. When people are afraid that an inspector is going to come in and look for the evidence that particular pieces of work have been done, they want everything documented. So there\u2019s a very high compliance culture in a lot of schools.\u201d\nI started to panic a bit because I thought, I feel like I\u2019m banging my head against a brick wall here Michael\nOfsted inspections put schools and teachers under acute stress. Last year, headteacher Ruth Perry took her own life after she received news of a low Ofsted rating for her school in Reading. Her death led to an outcry against the punitive inspection process, with headteachers across the country saying they were considering refusing entry to Ofsted until the inspectorate committed to significant change. It was reported last month that single-phrase Ofsted judgments such as \u201cinadequate\u201d would be scrapped for more nuanced descriptors \u2013 but the Department for Education has denied this.\nMichael, who taught at A-level, felt a huge pressure to ensure his students achieved good grades after the Covid pandemic. He had joined his school at a time when \u201cOfsted was breathing down their neck quite heavily\u201d, and they had built the college back up from \u201cinadequate\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d. But then, during the lockdowns, a system of teacher-assessed grades was introduced to replace the cancelled formal exams. In the later lockdowns, Michael found himself teaching A-level students whose GCSEs had also been disrupted, and he saw a sharp drop in their results compared to previous cohorts. \u201cI started to panic a bit because I thought, I feel like I\u2019m banging my head against a brick wall here. I\u2019m not able, in the same way, to affect these people\u2019s lives and steer them in a better direction.\u201d\nAttendance had also plummeted. \u201cMy college, due to financial issues, was more reluctant to kick students out,\u201d says Michael. \u201cThe problem then becomes that, if someone\u2019s just not attending, then it has a knock-on effect on the other learners. I started to see attendance as a whole dip, because the learners see others getting away with it.\u201d\nThe Covid pandemic had a devastating impact on British schools. There have been accounts of young infants, whose early years were spent in lockdown, \u201creaching school age still in nappies, and unable to use a knife and fork, due to lockdown\u2019s impact on early years development. Falling school attendance and deteriorating behaviour are issues for older students, thanks to the breakdown in the relationship and trust between schools and parents. Covid also contributed to rising levels of poverty in the UK, in large part due to a loss of earnings for many families. About 4.2 million children are in relative poverty in the country, while the number of young people in extreme poverty \u2013 meaning their families cannot afford to clothe them, clean them or keep them warm \u2013 has tripled over the past three years.\nSome schools are offering teachers one day off a fortnight in a bid to improve wellbeing and attract new people to the profession ( Getty/iStock )\n\u201cThe impact of poverty in the classroom is not just the lack of material goods,\u201d says Mc Brearty. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that goes with that \u2013 so you have kids that aren\u2019t sleeping, might not have a bed, aren\u2019t eating.\u201d Children living in these conditions become agitated, exhausted and unable to concentrate. \u201cIf you\u2019ve gone into the teaching profession because you\u2019re motivated by wanting to help children and young people learn, or be the best they can be, or fall head over heels in love with art, you can\u2019t do any of that if kids are hungry and not safe and not well looked after. That\u2019s what sits behind the poverty numbers.\u201d\nAnother key issue taking teachers away from their main job \u2013 to educate \u2013 is the poor state of the country\u2019s wider public services. \u201cIf you can\u2019t safely refer a child to mental health services, if social care is not able to deal with a case that is serious, if you cannot get appropriate support for the special needs that exist in the cohort that you\u2019re teaching \u2013 this is really, really problematic stuff,\u201d says Mc Brearty. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a child who is disclosing suicidal ideation, you won\u2019t necessarily get any mental health support for that. It\u2019s a real emotional burden on people in the job, and is not what they signed up to do.\u201d\nKate describes herself as more than just a teacher for her children, saying that, a lot of the time, she is effectively their \u201csocial worker, carer, and safeguarder\u201d. \u201cI also have a lot of children with special needs in my class, but lots of them are on the waiting list for a support plan. It can take up to a year and a half for the funding to come through, and in the meantime, the teacher\u2019s dealing with this massive issue, without any support.\u201d\nBehaviour and behaviour management are also key contributors to mental health issues among teachers. \u201cLast year, there was a little boy in my class who was very violent,\u201d says Kate. \u201cHe was hitting me, biting me, punching the other children. He didn\u2019t get excluded until it got severe, until somebody had a severely black eye, probably after about eight months of violent incidents, and that is simply because there\u2019s no money. The school lost control over being able to manage that behaviour. They didn\u2019t have behaviour teams coming in to manage it. And they didn\u2019t have a pupil referral unit that the child could go straight into because they are absolutely overloaded. They are full.\u201d\nIssues such as behaviour tend to worsen when children are distracted, or have low attention spans. \u201cThe level of digital engagement by children and young people is changing attention spans and their ability to concentrate,\u201d says Mc Brearty, who argues that children\u2019s phone use and online activity also brings other issues into the classroom that make teachers\u2019 jobs harder. \u201cThe amount of information \u2013 good and bad, true and false, reliable and not reliable \u2013 that the kids can access is off the charts,\u201d she says. \u201cI was sitting on the bus with my son\u2019s friends the other day, 10-year-olds, and taking them to a party. One kid was on his phone, and he was just scrolling through horrible images of decomposing bodies. I was like, you\u2019re 10. How are you looking at this? What kids have access to is gobsmacking, and that does bring into the classroom a whole array of often unexpected issues. At the charity, we\u2019ve been asked, \u2018How do I talk to kids about the Israel-Palestine conflict?\u2019 So we run webinars for how to discuss difficult topics as safely as possible.\u201d\nSo what are the solutions for how to improve teachers\u2019 mental health? Some schools are offering teachers one day off a fortnight in a bid to improve wellbeing and attract new people to the profession. Many schools around the country are already prohibiting mobile phone use, with the government launching a crackdown in February. Education Support, meanwhile, provides a free counselling helpline for struggling teachers, and the charity Mental Health UK offers advice on coping with stress, getting a good night\u2019s sleep, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance on its site.\nBut Mc Brearty says a lot of the necessary changes need to come from government. \u201cThey need to address the funding for wider services. Special educational needs funding is a car crash and needs to be resolved. We need a strategy around children in poverty that befits a country as wealthy as we are. Teacher pay has fallen in real terms since 2010 \u2013 pay matters, because it\u2019s a statement of value, and at the moment, the message is that society doesn\u2019t really value education. They have to rescope what they\u2019re asking schools to do and ask them to do a lot less, or put a load more money in to allow them to resource the gazillion things they\u2019ve asked them to do. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the choice.\n\u201cAnd everything else, for me, is moving deck chairs around on the top of the Titanic.\u201d\n*Names have been changed in this article\nAll teachers and education staff can call Education Support\u2019s free and confidential helpline 24/7.

All appear blindfolded, their heads hanging heavy under the glare of floodlights.\nA putrid stench filled the air and the room hummed with the men\u2019s murmurs, the Israeli who was at the facility told CNN. Forbidden from speaking to each other, the detainees mumbled to themselves.\n\u201cWe were told they were not allowed to move. They should sit upright. They\u2019re not allowed to talk. Not allowed to peek under their blindfold.\u201d\nGuards were instructed \u201cto scream uskot\u201d \u2013 shut up in Arabic \u2013 and told to \u201cpick people out that were problematic and punish them,\u201d the source added.\nA leaked photograph of the detention facility shows a blindfolded man with his arms above his head. Obtained by CNN\nCNN spoke to three Israeli whistleblowers who worked at the Sde Teiman desert camp, which holds Palestinians detained during Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. All spoke out at risk of legal repercussions and reprisals from groups supportive of Israel\u2019s hardline policies in Gaza.\nThey paint a picture of a facility where doctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from constant handcuffing; of medical procedures sometimes performed by underqualified medics earning it a reputation for being \u201ca paradise for interns\u201d; and where the air is filled with the smell of neglected wounds left to rot.\nWe were told they were not allowed to move. They should sit upright. They\u2019re not allowed to talk. Not allowed to peek under their blindfold. An Israeli whistleblower recounting his experience at Sde Teiman\nAccording to the accounts, the facility some 18 miles from the Gaza frontier is split into two parts: enclosures where around 70 Palestinian detainees from Gaza are placed under extreme physical restraint, and a field hospital where wounded detainees are strapped to their beds, wearing diapers and fed through straws.\n\u201cThey stripped them down of anything that resembles human beings,\u201d said one whistleblower, who worked as a medic at the facility\u2019s field hospital.\n\u201c(The beatings) were not done to gather intelligence. They were done out of revenge,\u201d said another whistleblower. \u201cIt was punishment for what they (the Palestinians) did on October 7 and punishment for behavior in the camp.\u201d\nResponding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on all the allegations made in this report, the Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement: \u201cThe IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation\u2019s Division) investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\u201d\n\u201cDetainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.\u201d\nThe IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk.\nReports of abuse at Sde Teiman have already surfaced in Israeli and Arab media after an outcry from Israeli and Palestinian rights groups over conditions there. But this rare testimony from Israelis working at the facility sheds further light on Israel\u2019s conduct as it wages war in Gaza, with fresh allegations of mistreatment. It also casts more doubt on the Israeli government\u2019s repeated assertions that it acts in accordance with accepted international practices and law.\nCNN has requested permission from the Israeli military to access the Sde Teiman base. Last month, a CNN team covered a small protest outside its main gate staged by Israeli activists demanding the closure of the facility. Israeli security forces questioned the team for around 30 minutes there, demanding to see the footage taken by CNN\u2019s photojournalist. Israel often subjects reporters, even foreign journalists, to military censorship on security issues.\nDetained in the desert\nThe Israeli military has acknowledged partially converting three different military facilities into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, in which Israeli authorities say about 1,200 were killed and over 250 were abducted, and the subsequent Israeli offensive in Gaza, killing nearly 35,000 people according to the strip\u2019s health ministry. These facilities are Sde Teiman in the Negev desert, as well as Anatot and Ofer military bases in the occupied West Bank.\nThe camps are part of the infrastructure of Israel\u2019s Unlawful Combatants Law, an amended legislation passed by the Knesset last December that expanded the military\u2019s authority to detain suspected militants.\nPatrick Gallagher/CNN\nThe law permits the military to detain people for 45 days without an arrest warrant, after which they must be transferred to Israel\u2019s formal prison system (IPS), where over 9,000 Palestinians are being held in conditions that rights groups say have drastically deteriorated since October 7. Two Palestinian prisoners associations said last week that 18 Palestinians \u2013 including leading Gaza surgeon Dr. Adnan al-Bursh \u2013 had died in Israeli custody over the course of the war.\nThe military detention camps \u2013 where the number of inmates is unknown \u2013 serve as a filtration point during the arrest period mandated by the Unlawful Combatants Law. After their detention in the camps, those with suspected Hamas links are transferred to the IPS, while those whose militant ties have been ruled out are released back to Gaza.\nCNN interviewed over a dozen former Gazan detainees who appeared to have been released from those camps. They said they could not determine where they were held because they were blindfolded through most of their detention and cut off from the outside world. But the details of their accounts tally with those of the whistleblowers.\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear from former detainees held inside Sde Teiman 00:52 - Source: CNN\n\u201cWe looked forward to the night so we could sleep. Then we looked forward to the morning in hopes that our situation might change,\u201d said Dr. Mohammed al-Ran, recalling his detainment at a military facility where he said he endured desert temperatures, swinging from the heat of the day to the chill of night. CNN interviewed him outside Gaza last month.\nAl-Ran, a Palestinian who holds Bosnian citizenship, headed the surgical unit at northern Gaza\u2019s Indonesian hospital, one of the first to be shut down and raided as Israel carried out its aerial, ground and naval offensive.\nHe was arrested on December 18, he said, outside Gaza City\u2019s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, where he had been working for three days after fleeing his hospital in the heavily bombarded north.\nHe was stripped down to his underwear, blindfolded and his wrists tied, then dumped in the back of a truck where, he said, the near-naked detainees were piled on top of one another as they were shuttled to a detention camp in the middle of the desert.\nThe details in his account are consistent with those of dozens of others collected by CNN recounting the conditions of arrest in Gaza. His account is also supported by numerous images depicting mass arrests published on social media profiles belonging to Israeli soldiers. Many of those images show captive Gazans, their wrists or ankles tied by cables, in their underwear and blindfolded.\nAl-Ran was held in a military detention center for 44 days, he told CNN. \u201cOur days were filled with prayer, tears, and supplication. This eased our agony,\u201d said al-Ran.\n\u201cWe cried and cried and cried. We cried for ourselves, cried for our nation, cried for our community, cried for our loved ones. We cried about everything that crossed our minds.\u201d\nDr. Mohammed Al-Ran headed the surgical unit at Gaza\u2019s Indonesian hospital, one of the first to be raided and shut down by Israel. From Social Media\nAl-Ran is pictured on the day of his release from a detention camp, in a visibly worse physical condition. From Social Media\nA week into his imprisonment, the detention camp\u2019s authorities ordered him to act as an intermediary between the guards and the prisoners, a role known as Shawish, \u201csupervisor,\u201d in vernacular Arabic.\nAccording to the Israeli whistleblowers, a Shawish is normally a prisoner who has been cleared of suspected links to Hamas after interrogation.\nThe Israeli military denied holding detainees unnecessarily, or using them for translation purposes. \u201cIf there is no reason for continued detention, the detainees are released back to Gaza,\u201d they said in a statement.\nOur days were filled with prayer, tears, and supplication. This eased our agony. Former detainee Dr. Mohammed al-Ran\nHowever, whistleblower and detainee accounts \u2013 particularly pertaining to Shawish \u2013 cast doubt on the IDF\u2019s depiction of its clearing process. Al-Ran says that he served as Shawish for several weeks after he was cleared of Hamas links. Whistleblowers also said that the absolved Shawish served as intermediaries for some time.\nThey are typically proficient in Hebrew, according to the eyewitnesses, enabling them to communicate the guards\u2019 orders to the rest of the prisoners in Arabic.\nFor that, al-Ran said he was given a special privilege: his blindfold was removed. He said this was another kind of hell.\n\u201cPart of my torture was being able to see how people were being tortured,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first you couldn\u2019t see. You couldn\u2019t see the torture, the vengeance, the oppression.\n\u201cWhen they removed my blindfold, I could see the extent of the humiliation and abasement \u2026 I could see the extent to which they saw us not as human beings but as animals.\u201d\nA leaked photograph of an enclosure where detainees in gray tracksuits are seen blindfolded and sitting on paper-thin mattresses. CNN was able to geolocate the hangar in the Sde Teiman facility. A portion of this image has been blurred by CNN to protect the identity of the source. Obtained by CNN\nAl-Ran\u2019s account of the forms of punishment he saw were corroborated by the whistleblowers who spoke with CNN. A prisoner who committed an offense such as speaking to another would be ordered to raise his arms above his head for up to an hour. The prisoner\u2019s hands would sometimes be zip-tied to a fence to ensure that he did not come out of the stress position.\nFor those who repeatedly breached the prohibition on speaking and moving, the punishment became more severe. Israeli guards would sometimes take a prisoner to an area outside the enclosure and beat him aggressively, according to two whistleblowers and al-Ran. A whistleblower who worked as a guard said he saw a man emerge from a beating with his teeth, and some bones, apparently broken.\nWhen they removed my blindfold, I could see the extent of the humiliation and abasement \u2026 I could see the extent to which they saw us not as human beings but as animals. Former detainee Dr. Mohammed Al-Ran\nThat whistleblower and al-Ran also described a routine search when the guards would unleash large dogs on sleeping detainees, lobbing a sound grenade at the enclosure as troops barged in. Al-Ran called this \u201cthe nightly torture.\u201d\n\u201cWhile we were cabled, they unleashed the dogs that would move between us, and trample over us,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cYou\u2019d be lying on your belly, your face pressed against the ground. You can\u2019t move, and they\u2019re moving above you.\u201d\nThe same whistleblower recounted the search in the same harrowing detail. \u201cIt was a special unit of the military police that did the so-called search,\u201d said the source. \u201cBut really it was an excuse to hit them. It was a terrifying situation.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a lot of screaming and dogs barking.\u201d\nStrapped to beds in a field hospital\nWhistleblower accounts portrayed a different kind of horror at the Sde Teiman field hospital.\n\u201cWhat I felt when I was dealing with those patients is an idea of total vulnerability,\u201d said one medic who worked at Sde Teiman.\n\u201cIf you imagine yourself being unable to move, being unable to see what\u2019s going on, and being completely naked, that leaves you completely exposed,\u201d the source said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that borders on, if not crosses to, psychological torture.\u201d\nAnother whistleblower said he was ordered to perform medical procedures on the Palestinian detainees for which he was not qualified.\n\u201cI was asked to learn how to do things on the patients, performing minor medical procedures that are totally outside my expertise,\u201d he said, adding that this was frequently done without anesthesia.\n\u201cIf they complained about pain, they would be given paracetamol,\u201d he said, using another name for acetaminophen.\n\u201cJust being there felt like being complicit in abuse.\u201d\nVideo Ad Feedback See the model CNN has recreated based on eyewitness accounts showing inside Sde Teiman 00:41 - Source: CNN\nThe same whistleblower also said he witnessed an amputation performed on a man who had sustained injuries caused by the constant zip-tying of his wrists.

An Israeli whistleblower recalling his experience at Sde Teiman\nWhistleblowers also said that medical team were told to refrain from signing medical documents, corroborating previous reporting by rights group Physicians for Human Rights in Israel (PHRI).\nThe PHRI report released in April warned of \u201ca serious concern that anonymity is employed to prevent the possibility of investigations or complaints regarding breaches of medical ethics and professionalism.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sign anything, and there is no verification of authority,\u201d said the same whistleblower who said he lacked the appropriate training for the treatment he was asked to administer. \u201cIt is a paradise for interns because it\u2019s like you do whatever you want.\u201d\nCNN also requested comment from the Israeli health ministry on the allegations in this report. The ministry referred CNN back to the IDF.\nConcealed from the outside world\nSde Teiman and other military detention camps have been shrouded in secrecy since their inception. Israel has repeatedly refused requests to disclose the number of detainees held at the facilities, or to reveal the whereabouts of Gazan prisoners.\nLast Wednesday, the Israeli Supreme Court held a hearing in response to a petition brought forward by Israeli rights group, HaMoked, to reveal the location of a Palestinian X-Ray technician detained from Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza in February. It was the first court session of its kind since October 7.\nIsrael\u2019s highest court had previously rejected writs of habeas corpus filed on behalf of dozens of Palestinians from Gaza held in unknown locations.\nThe disappearances \u201callows for the atrocities that we\u2019ve been hearing about to happen,\u201d said Tal Steiner, an Israeli human rights lawyer and executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel.\n\u201cPeople completely disconnected from the outside world are the most vulnerable to torture and mistreatment,\u201d Steiner said in an interview with CNN.\nPlanet Labs PBC Planet Labs PBC Since October 7, more than 100 structures, including large tents and hangars, appeared within these areas of the Sde Teiman desert camp. Planet Labs PBC\nSatellite images provide further insight into activities at Sde Teiman, revealing that in the months since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, more than 100 new structures, including large tents and hangars, have been built at the desert camp. A comparison of aerial photographs from September 10, 2023 and March 1 this year also showed a significant increase in the number of vehicles at the facility, indicating an uptick in activity. Satellite imagery from two dates in early December showed construction work in progress.\nCNN also geolocated the two leaked photographs showing the enclosure holding the group of blindfolded men in gray tracksuits. The pattern of panels seen on the roof matched those of a large hangar visible in satellite imagery. The structure, which resembles an animal pen, is located in the central area of the Sde Teiman compound. It is an older structure seen among new buildings which have appeared since the war began.\nCNN reviewed satellite images from two other military detention camps \u2013 Ofer and Anatot bases in the occupied West Bank \u2013 and did not detect expansion in the grounds since October 7. Several rights groups and legal experts say they believe that Sde Teiman, which is the nearest to Gaza, likely hosts the largest number of detainees of the three military detention camps.\n\u201cI was there for 23 days. Twenty-three days that felt like 100 years,\u201d said 27-year-old Ibrahim Yassine on the day of his release from a military detention camp.\nHe was lying in a crowded room with over a dozen newly freed men \u2013 they were still in the grey tracksuit prison uniforms. Some had deep flesh wounds from where the handcuffs had been removed.\n\u201cWe were handcuffed and blindfolded,\u201d said another man, 43-year-old Sufyan Abu Salah. \u201cToday is the first day I can see.\u201d\nSeveral had a glassy look in their eyes and were seemingly emaciated. One elderly man breathed through an oxygen machine as he lay on a stretcher. Outside the hospital, two freed men from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society embraced their colleagues.\nFor Dr. Al-Ran, his reunion with his friends was anything but joyful. The experience, he said, rendered him mute for a month as he battled an \u201cemotional deadness.\u201d\n\u201cIt was very painful. When I was released, people expected me to miss them, to embrace them. But there was a gap,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cThe people who were with me at the detention facility became my family. Those friendships were the only things that belonged to us.\u201d\nJust before his release, a fellow prisoner had called out to him, his voice barely rising above a whisper, al-Ran said. He asked the doctor to find his wife and kids in Gaza. \u201cHe asked me to tell them that it is better for them to be martyrs,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cIt is better for them to die than to be captured and held here.\u201d\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch CNN challenge Israeli guards at Sde Teiman 00:53 - Source: CNN\nCredits\nExecutive producer: Barbara Arvanitidis\nSenior investigations writer: Tamara Qiblawi\nChief global affairs correspondent: Matthew Chance\nOSINT reporter: Allegra Goodwin\nPhotojournalist: Alex Platt\nReporters: Abeer Salman, Ami Kaufman, Kareem Khadder, Mohammad Al Sawalhi and Tareq Al Hilou\nVisual and graphic editors: Carlotta Dotto, Lou Robinson and Mark Oliver\n3D designer: Tom James\nPhoto editor: Sarah Tilotta\nVideo editors: Mark Baron, Julie Zink and Augusta Anthony\nMotion designers: Patrick Gallagher and Yukari Schrickel\nDigital editors: Laura Smith-Spark and Eliza Mackintosh\nExecutive editors: Dan Wright and Matt Wells\nEditor\u2019s note: Tamara Qiblawi wrote and reported from London.

Through a youth-led approach, the study sheds light on the multifaceted challenges. It offers strategic recommendations on increasing women's participation in decision-making and the peace process between Israel and Palestine, primarily focusing on intra-Palestinian reconciliation efforts. The findings of the study reveal two types of systematic barriers hindering women's political participation: internal, which include the patriarchal structures/institutions, gender stereotypes and norms, and discriminatory legislation, and external, which are linked to the impact of the occupation. Specifically, the socio-economic disparities are both internally connected with gender norms and externally derived from the repressive occupation policies that impact the whole society. Moreover, the freezing of the electoral process, lack of resources, and the absence of comprehensive local government strategies further exacerbate women's exclusion and lack of agency. Based on the findings, the study proposes transformative strategies to enhance women's political leadership and engagement in internal decision-making and policy development to create the conditions for their meaningful contribution to peace in the region, starting from internal Palestinian reconciliation. These strategies include translating commitments such as UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security into actionable measures, dismantling patriarchal norms, fostering gender equality in public institutions and policies, and garnering political parties' support for the nomination of women for public office. Additionally, the study advocates for developing protection and accountability mechanisms within government institutions, reforming educational curricula to incorporate gender-sensitive content, and fostering collaborations among civil society organisations, local authorities, political parties, the media, decision-makers, and international stakeholders. The research analysis leads to a series of actionable recommendations directed at key stakeholders at the national level, including the Palestinian Authority, political parties, civil society organisations, and media entities. By integrating these recommendations into their policies and practice, the Palestinian national and local authorities would foster an enabling environment for women's active participation in negotiating peace.\n---\n1.0 Background\n\nIn 2022, the Palestinian Centre for Peace and Democracy (PCPD) conducted the research titled Empowering Palestinian Women's Active Political Participation: Key Findings from Youth-led Research, under the project \u201cYoung Women and Men Engaging in Peace Negotiations within the Framework of UN Resolution 1325.\u201d The project included capacity-building workshops and policy dialogues, and it was realised in collaboration with the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC) and with the financial support of the United Nations Women\u2019s Peace and Humanitarian Fund Rapid Response Window for Women's Participation in Peace Process.\n\nThe research study delved into how and why Palestinian women should advance their demands for meaningful participation in decision-making and peace processes between Israel and Palestine and intra-Palestinian reconciliation processes. It reflected a youth- led approach grounded on the premise that young people possess critical insights into the dynamics and complexities surrounding the inclusion of women in decision-making and peace processes. Further, it emphasised the importance of providing young people, in particular young women, with the opportunity to build a better future based on their vision of sustainable peace, which previous generations failed to establish.\n\nThe research was designed from the perspectives of the youth, and it led to the development of a series of recommendations for government actors, political parties, and civil society for the effective implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda in Palestine to enhance women\u2019s political leadership and active engagement in\n\nthe peace processes. These recommendations encompass repositioning women\u2019s\n\nrepresentation and participation at the forefront of the country\u2019s political agenda, dismantling harmful gender stereotypes and norms, and promoting gender equality throughout society to achieve lasting peace and development in Palestine.\n---\n2.0 Women, Peace, and Security: The Context in Palestine\n\n2.1 At the Root of the Problem: Women\u2019s Absence from the Public Sphere\n\nWomen\u2019s political participation in Palestine reached its peak in the 1980s with the first\n\nIntifada when they played a crucial role in political leadership and joined men in protests against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, when the Palestinian National Authority was established in 1994, it was predominantly led by men with rigid conservative views on women\u2019s role in society. This reinforced harmful gender stereotypes and patriarchal values that continue to pervade the Palestinian socio- cultural fabric.\n\nToday, women make up half of the population in Palestine (49%). Despite global\n\nadvancements in women\u2019s rights, Palestinian women face persistent challenges in\n\nparticipating politically at the national level. This is evident in the declining participation of women in the public sphere, which is closely linked to their systematic exclusion from the processes and the negotiations for reconciliation between the West Bank and Gaza political leadership.\n\nWomen\u2019s autonomy and decision-making power are severely limited within both private and public spheres. They are often portrayed as confined to traditional household roles, unpaid care, and child-rearing work, while men dominate the political and social spheres.\n\nConsequently, women\u2019s voices remain unheard in the public space, leaving them excluded from decision-making processes and peace negotiations that directly impact their lives.\n\nThe Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories compounds women\u2019s oppression and exclusion, alongside the existing patriarchal structures.1 Palestinian women bear the brunt of restricted freedom of movement and association, land confiscations, and forced evictions by the Israeli occupying authorities and illegal settlers. The Gaza blockade as well as the COVID-19 pandemic have taken a heavy toll on women by limiting their ability to travel for work, increasing risks of harassment by settlers and gender-based violence (GBV), and increasing rates of unemployment, particularly among young women. These challenges have further isolated women, limiting their participation in the political sphere and further disempowering their voices.\n\nOccupation, conflict and patriarchy: impacts on Palestinian women, P. Urrutia Arestiz\u00e1bal, Escola de Cultura de Pau, 2019\n---\n2.2 Taking a Step Forward: Palestine\u2019s National Action Plan on WPS\n\nAgainst this backdrop, there is a strong commitment among Palestinian youth to build a more gender-equal society and enhance women\u2019s meaningful participation in political and peace processes.\n\nPalestine formally acknowledged the importance of implementing the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) in 2005, reaffirming the crucial role of women in peacebuilding, conflict prevention, and peace processes. In 2015, the Palestinian government launched its first National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS). The NAP I aimed to protect women and girls from the impacts of Israeli occupation and conflict and increase their involvement in local and international decision- making processes.\n\nPresently, Palestine is in the process of implementing its second WPS NAP for 2020-2024. The political and economic developments since NAP I have provided the opportunity to build on achievements and lessons generated and create space for new priorities, such as supporting women\u2019s leadership in the security sector and internal Palestinian dialogue and strengthening their resilience and participation in recovery and rehabilitation efforts.\n\nHowever, despite these commitments, the effective implementation of the WPS Agenda is challenging, particularly in the context of peace negotiations. Since 2007, Palestinian women have been systematically excluded from the internal reconciliation attempts. As one indicator of this exclusion, the recent intra-Palestinian reconciliation effort in Cairo (2023) featured only one woman out of fifty-four negotiators. Achieving transformative change in Palestine requires translating commitments of the UNSCR 1325 and the WPS Agenda into tangible actions for women\u2019s meaningful inclusion in decision-making and peace processes. Without the full, equal, and meaningful inclusion of women, the pathway to just and sustainable peace in Palestine remains distant.\n---\n3.0 Methodology\n\nThe research adopted a blend of quantitative and qualitative methodologies to gauge\n\npublic perception regarding women\u2019s role in the public sphere and develop a set of\n\nrecommendations to enhance their participation in political decision-making and the peace process between Israel and Palestine, primarily focusing on intra-Palestinian reconciliation efforts. The study employed a survey designed by Palestinian youth peace activists to explore the future prospects for Palestinian women\u2019s political participation.\n\nQuestions covered various domains such as obstacles to women\u2019s political participation\n\nand gender equality institutions; strategies for government, civil society organisations, and other actors to promote women\u2019s political participation; and participation of women in negotiations with Israel and inter-Palestinian dialogue. Out of 1,466 questionnaires distributed across eleven West Bank governorates,2 a representative sample of people across different areas of the West Bank, carefully selected based on age3 and gender4 criteria generated 1,308 fully completed questionnaires. Close to 75% of the respondents were youth between the ages of 18 to 32 years. Additionally, key informant interviews were conducted with three distinguished women leaders \u2013 Mrs Zahira Kamal5, Dr Hanan Ashrawi6, and Dr Laila Ghannam7 \u2013 each of whom has significant experience in political decision-making and peace negotiations.\n\nHebron, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Ramallah, Nablus, Qalqiya, Tubas, Salfit, Jericho, Tulkarm, and Jenin. Between ages 18 and 50 years 62.8% female respondents and 37.2% male respondents 5 Zahira Kamal, a prominent Palestinian politician was Minister of Women's Affairs from 2003 to 2006 and the secretary general of the Palestinian Democratic Union (FIDA political party) prior to that. With six years of detention under town arrest from 1980 to 1986, Zahira is a resilient advocate for gender sensitivity, and human rights, and the founder of the Palestinian Federation of Women\u2019s Action Committees. Dr Hanan Ashrawi served as a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's Executive Committee and was the official Spokesperson during the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference. She held the position of Minister of Higher Education and was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 1996 and 2006. In 1994, Dr Ashrawi founded the Independent Commission for Human Rights, where she served as Commissioner-General until 1995. A key founder of civil society organisations such as MIFTAH and AMAN, Dr Ashrawi stands as the sole Palestinian woman who actively participated in negotiations with Israelis from the Madrid Conference in 1991 to 1993. Dr Layla Ghannam, the Ramallah-Al Bereh Governor since 2010, is both the youngest and only female governor of Ramallah and el-Bireh.\n---\n4.0 Key Findings\n\n4.1 Interest and Level of Political Participation\n\nWhile 36.3% of the respondents expressed strong interest in local political issues, even more, 39%, displayed no definite interest in political issues.8 However, those with an interest cited contributing to political life by supporting civil society organisations and political parties and leveraging social media platforms to express their political opinions along with voting.\n\nWhen asked about interest in participating in the inter-Palestine reconciliation processes, the majority of respondents\u2019 (31.3%) preferred being an observer in the process rather than an active participant or on the ground putting pressure on the contending parties (27.7%). Indeed, most respondents were aware of UNSCR 1325, however, they were lacking in awareness of its achievements in increasing women\u2019s political participation.\n\nAt the same time, the findings showed a positive trend in the increasing engagement and understanding of young people to influence political spaces and integrate themselves into local and national political processes through diverse channels of political action. There is a clear need to continue this trend: to increase the interest of Palestinian youth in public policymaking, as it holds the potential to generate momentum for the meaningful inclusion of women in political spheres and peace processes. The involvement of young people in politics can serve as a catalyst for transformative change if relevant stakeholders work for it.\n\n4.2 Obstacles to Women\u2019s Political Participation\n\nMost survey respondents, 79.6%, described the predominant obstacle to women\u2019s rights\n\nand inclusion as stemming from Israel\u2019s occupation policies such as repression, killing,\n\nseizure, and confiscation of land and settlement. The prevailing environment of oppression and intimidation under occupation instilled fear, especially in women, hindering their political activism and demand for democratic representation.\n\nThe majority of the respondents (66.5%) also believed that the constitutional provisions perpetuate gender biases and inequalities between men and women, further compounding the entrenched patriarchal notions in society. This includes the absence of a supportive environment for women in civil institutions (64.7%) and discrimination in legislation against women (67.7%) such as the absence of family law in Palestine and contradicting Jordanian9 and British10 Penal Codes in the West Bank and Gaza. All of\n\nthese factors, respondents agreed, undermine the Palestinian Authority\u2019s efforts to\n\ncombat violence against women such as the Council of Ministers Resolution to Improve the Protection of Women Subjected to Violence (2005) and the Presidential Decree ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All\n\n8 The total percentage may not add up to 100% due to the inclusion of other response options. In the survey, 25% of respondents selected alternative choices not reflected in the presented data. Jordanian Penal Code No. 16 of 1960, applicable in the West Bank. British Penal Code No. 47 of 1936, applicable in the Gaza Strip.\n---\nResearch Summary - Empowering Palestinian Women\u2019s Active Political Participation Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 2009.\n\nA significant number of respondents, 75.9%, described the freezing of the Palestinian electoral process, the unwillingness of political parties, and the absence of local government strategies supporting their participation in elections as barriers to women\u2019s political engagement. Respondents also referenced economic challenges, saying that capitalist companies prefer to employ men over women and that this undermines women\u2019s capacity to participate in politics. Indeed, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2022, the unemployment rate for women reached 40% compared\n\nto 20% for men. Women\u2019s lack of resources makes active political involvement such as running for election extremely difficult.\n\nDespite these structural obstacles for women, 69.3% of the respondents identified women themselves as a significant hindrance to their political participation. The study suggests that this reluctance is likely rooted in the significant sociocultural and economic barriers women must overcome, including support from the family, to participate in politics.\n\n4.3 Strategies for Enhancing Women\u2019s Political Participation\n\nIn light of the challenges that limit women's political participation, the study has identified several key strategies aimed at promoting and facilitating women's active involvement in the public domain [Figure 1]. These strategies may help overcome societal barriers and empower women to take an active role in shaping their communities and the wider political landscape.\n\nMore respondents, 83.5%, indicated the government should develop and adopt transitional mechanisms to support women's participation in political decision-making processes to follow up on the commitment to 30% quota for women as decided by the Palestinian National Council and felt that the government should also develop and adopt accountability mechanisms (77.3%). Similarly, many respondents, 76.5%, indicated that the government needs to ensure a gender-sensitive work environment based on a commitment to achieve gender equality within public institutions and policies.\n\nAdditionally, 68.8% agreed that the government\u2019s adoption and implementation of\n\nUNSCR 1325 in Palestine through NAP was a crucial strategy to develop protection mechanisms for women and girls and to increase their participation in peace-making and conflict resolution efforts. Such participation would include integrating women into decision-making processes and incorporating their views into the reconciliation process, according to the objectives of UNSCR 1325.\n---\nFigure 1: Participants\u2019 Support for Strategies to Promote Women\u2019s Political Participation\n\nParticipants recognise that addressing the lack of supportive institutional structures to foster women\u2019s meaningful inclusion extends beyond politicians and decision-makers. Three key actors, namely civil society organisations (CSOs), the education system, and the local public media were identified as pivotal contributors to promoting gender equality and inclusivity in Palestine.\n\nMost respondents, 76%, concurred that CSOs must work with political parties to support the nomination of women for public office. Respondents generally indicated they understand CSOs\u2019 instrumental role in shaping positive attitudes in society towards women in politics. According to the respondents, Palestinian CSOs (such as the PCPD) are a beacon for gender equality and women\u2019s participation, working relentlessly to contrast the retreat of democratic values in the country. They conduct the critical work of training young people to become leaders committed to fostering inclusivity and peace in Palestine.\n\nThe relevant stakeholders must recognise and reinforce the pivotal role of civil society through collaboration with the local authorities, national decision-makers, and international stakeholders alike. This collaboration is imperative for amplifying the impact\n\nof civil society initiatives and effecting meaningful change in attitudes toward women\u2019s political participation.\n\nSimilarly, to the civil society sector, the education system holds a significant role in shaping gender relations and social norms in Palestine. The current education system reinforces gender norms that place women in subordinate roles compared to men. From early on, children are imparted notions that confine women to domestic roles, perpetuating gender biases.\n---\nTo counteract gender biases, a substantial majority of respondents (84.1%) advocate for a fundamental shift in the education sector and evince a strong inclination towards reforming education curricula. This includes gender-sensitive content and textbooks that break gender stereotypes and present positive gender norms and socialisation. Gender-sensitive school curricula create an inclusive and respectful learning environment, empowering students to challenge gender stereotypes, embrace diversity, and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nFurthermore, public media serves as a critical stakeholder in shaping public opinion on gender relations in Palestine. A significant 75.1% of young respondents emphasise the need for Palestinian CSOs to collaborate with local media to curb sexist, gender-based\n\nstereotypes and foster women\u2019s political participation. This collaboration could extend to\n\nawareness-raising campaigns that promote women\u2019s political representation and participation, a strategy 79.6% of respondents supported. This joint effort holds the potential to dismantle gender stereotypes and contribute to a more inclusive and informed society.\n\n4.4 The Participation of Palestinian Women in Negotiations Within Inter-Palestine and Palestine-Israel\n\nWhile the respondents acknowledged the multifaceted barriers limiting women\u2019s access\n\nto decision-making spaces, a close examination of the reasons behind women\u2019s almost complete exclusion from the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations revealed that most attributed it to political leadership\u2019s deliberate exclusion of women, but some felt that women did not apply to participate in the negotiations or lack negotiation skills [Figure 2]. A small segment of the respondents, 5%, understand women\u2019s exclusion as a significant contributing factor to the failure of both Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the inter- Palestinian dialogue.\n---\nResearch Summary - Empowering Palestinian Women\u2019s Active Political Participation Figure 2: Causes of Women\u2019s Absence from Palestinian-Israel Negotiations\n\nThe most-cited reason for women's exclusion from inter-Palestine was patriarchal gender stereotypes in politics, although 22.5% of the respondents believed that women did not apply to participate in negotiations. [Figure 3].\n\nFigure 3: Causes of Women\u2019s Absence from Inter-Palestine Negotiations\n\nThese findings suggest that, despite the widespread recognition that unequal power relations contribute to women's exclusion from the political decision-making and peace processes, deeply entrenched patriarchal and misogynistic beliefs persist in a big part of the population. Over 50% of the people who responded to the survey ascribed the cause\n\nof exclusion to women\u2019s lack of agency. In that vein, lasting peace and stability in\n\nPalestine can only be achieved if women become active agents for change, both in peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine and within intra-Palestinian reconciliation processes.\n\nIn light of the study's findings, it is crucial to recognise and amplify the importance of women\u2019s participation in the negotiations between Palestine and Israel and in inter- Palestinian dialogues. The compelling data underscores the need for a transformative shift in perspectives - one that involves the comprehension of the UNSCR 1325 and the Palestinian WPS NAP. It is also necessary to acknowledge, strengthen, and amplify women\u2019s unique and intersectional perspectives, needs, and abilities to contribute to change at local, national, regional, and international levels.\n---\n5.0 The Way Forward\n\nThere is an immediate need to radically reshape perspectives and attitudes towards Palestinian women and to recognise their exceptional capability to fulfil vital political roles, formulate governmental decisions, and make meaningful contributions towards reaching peace. Concurrently, the active involvement of women in decision-making and policy development is essential for fostering substantive change within the Palestinian socio-political system.\n\nTo achieve this, governmental institutions, political parties, and policymakers must collaborate with civil society and feminist organisations to eradicate the root causes of gender inequality and ensure women\u2019s active engagement at all levels of political and peace processes in Palestine.\n\nThe following recommendations based on the findings are offered to guide key stakeholders in realising these transformative objectives: Palestinian Authority\n\nThe Palestinian Authority has the responsibility to implement its commitments to the WPS agenda reiterated in NAPs. Concretely, the Palestinian Authority should:\n\n1. 2. 3.\n\n4. 5.\n\nImplement its commitments stated in the NAP on WPS by \u25cf localising the provisions of the WPS Agenda to ensure that its principles are effectively integrated into the national context and \u25cf collaborating with CSOs, particularly women-led CSOs, to promote and implement the WPS Agenda. Support its vision for gender equality by \u25cf developing a comprehensive and actionable strategy and taking action to transform gender-biased public policies and \u25cf striving for equal representation of women in decision-making processes, ensuring their voices are heard and considered. Promote equitable representation by \u25cf advocating for policies that include quota systems in support of women, addressing existing imbalances in institutions such as: local governments,\n\npolitical parties\u2019 leadership, and in the Palestinian parliament, and \u25cf designing and implementing measures that positively impact social attitudes towards gender equality, challenging stereotypes and fostering inclusivity. Amend the legal system by \u25cf addressing gender disparities within the legal system and promoting justice and fairness for all and \u25cf designing and implementing accountability mechanisms to ensure that women and men receive equal and fair treatment before the law. Foster institutional gender equality by \u25cf developing and implementing internal policies within governmental institutions that foster gender equality and \u25cf establishing accountability mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating progress in achieving institutional gender equality goals.\n---\n6.\n\nInitiate a fundamental shift in the education system by \u25cf developing a gender-sensitive curriculum, incorporating content that addresses gender issues sensitively and presents positive gender norms and socialization, and \u25cf cultivating an educational environment that challenges stereotypes and encourages critical thinking on gender roles.\n\nPolitical Parties\n\nThe political parties have the responsibility to support women\u2019s participation in politics and provide them with the means necessary to access resources. Concretely, political parties should:\n\n1. 2. 3.\n\nPrioritise women\u2019s political participation by\n\n\u25cf incorporating women\u2019s participation as a central theme in their agendas\n\nand \u25cf making public commitments to creating inclusive spaces for women within the party structures and activities. Support women candidates in elections by \u25cf developing and implementing election strategies that support and promote women candidates and \u25cf investing in capacity-building programs for women, equipping them with the skills and resources needed for successful political engagement.\n\nEnhance women\u2019s agency by\n\n\u25cf implementing empowerment initiatives that focus on enhancing the agency of women both individually and within collective work and \u25cf ensuring administrative structures within political parties promote and value the contributions of women.\n\nCivil Society Organisations (CSOs)\n\nCSOs have the responsibility to collaborate with local authorities, national decision- makers, and international stakeholders to bring meaningful change in attitudes toward women\u2019s participation in politics and peace processes. Concretely, CSOs should:\n\n1. 2.\n\nEmpower women within leadership structures by \u25cf prioritising capacity development programs that empower women within organisational contexts and \u25cf working towards creating inclusive leadership structures within CSOs. Collaborate with decision-makers by \u25cf engaging in advocacy initiatives with local decision-makers on policies that ensure women\u2019s meaningful participation and \u25cf garnering international support for women\u2019s active engagement in political and reconciliation processes in Palestine, and the peace process between Palestine and Israel when it resumes.\n---\n3. 4. 5. 6.\n\nInvestigate women\u2019s role by\n\nundertaking research initiatives to investigate and highlight the significant role of women in decision-making at all levels and\n\nutilising research findings to advocate for increased women\u2019s inclusion in decision-making processes\n\nStrengthen women\u2019s agency by\n\n\u25cf establishing mentorship programs that focus on strengthening the agency and decision-making capabilities of young women in their public roles and \u25cf providing skill-strengthening initiatives to empower young women to navigate and succeed in the public sphere. Influence the creation of an enabling environment for women\u2019s participation by \u25cf engaging in public awareness campaigns to influence the creation of positive attitudes and challenge gender stereotypes towards women in politics and \u25cf working together with political parties to support the nomination of women within their structures. Collaborate with the media by \u25cf partnering to raise awareness of women's political representation through joint campaigns and \u25cf collaborating with local media outlets to dismantle gender stereotypes.\n\nThe Media The media plays a major role in shaping public opinion and it has a responsibility to contribute to gender equality in Palestine. Concretely, the media should:\n\n1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nEstablish collaborative platforms between CSOs and local media outlets by \u25cf discussing emerging issues, sharing best practices, and refining strategies to counter gender stereotypes effectively and \u25cf facilitating joint initiatives to address and counteract sexist and gender- based stereotypes through awareness campaigns.\n\nPromote women\u2019s political representation by \u25cf encouraging local media to engage in awareness-raising campaigns\n\npromoting women\u2019s political participation and representation and dismantling stereotypes and fostering a more inclusive and informed society.\n\nBuild journalists\u2019 capacity to support gender equality by \u25cf developing training programs for journalists within local media outlets to enhance their understanding of gender-sensitive reporting. \u25cf helping journalists navigate complex gender issues responsibly and to contribute to a more nuanced and accurate portrayal of women in politics. Establish monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track its progress on gender equality by \u25cf assessing the impact of collaborative efforts between CSOs and local media to generate insights into the effectiveness of awareness campaigns and \u25cf enabling adjustments to strategies and ensuring sustained progress toward\n---\ndismantling gender participation.\n\nstereotypes\n\nand\n\nenhancing\n\nwomen\u2019s\n\npolitical\n\nThese recommendations collectively form a comprehensive framework for stakeholders to undertake actions that will contribute to the transformative change necessary to ensure women\u2019s meaningful participation in political and peace processes in Palestine. The effective implementation of these recommendations has the potential to take significant strides toward achieving a future marked by increased political engagement for all women, thereby contributing to lasting peace and development in the region.", "65410": "title: West Bank: Israeli Forces\u2019 Unlawful Killings of Palestinians [EN/AR/HE] \n content: Lethal Shootings Show Disregard for Legal Standards\nIsraeli security forces have unlawfully used lethal force in fatal shootings of Palestinians, including deliberately executing Palestinians who posed no apparent security threat, based on documentation of several cases since 2022.\nThe United Nations reported that such killings are now taking place at a level without recent precedent in an environment in which those responsible need not fear the Israeli government will hold them accountable.\nGovernments should support the International Criminal Court\u2019s probe into serious crimes committed in Palestine and impose targeted sanctions against those responsible for grave abuses.\n(Jerusalem, May 8, 2023) \u2013 Israeli security forces have unlawfully used lethal force in fatal shootings of Palestinians in the West Bank, Human Rights Watch said today, based on documentation of several cases. Research into eight deaths in four incidents between July 2022 and October 2023 concluded that Israeli forces wrongfully fatally shot or deliberately executed Palestinians who posed no apparent security threat.\nHuman Rights Watch and other human rights groups have long documented the unlawful and excessive use of lethal force by Israeli forces in the West Bank and the Israeli government\u2019s failure to hold those responsible to account. According to the United Nations, Israeli security forces killed more than twice the number of Palestinians in the West Bank in 2023 than in any year since systematic data collection began in 2005, and the rate of killings was even higher during the first quarter of 2024.\n\u201cIsraeli security forces are not just unlawfully killing Palestinians in Gaza, but have been killing Palestinians without a legal basis in the West Bank, including deliberately executing Palestinians who posed no apparent threat,\u201d said Richard Weir, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThese killings are taking place at a level without recent precedent in an environment in which Israeli forces have no need to fear that their government will hold them accountable.\u201d\nBetween May and November 2023, Human Rights Watch interviewed 14 witnesses and 6 family members of victims of fatal shootings by Israeli security forces in the West Bank. Human Rights Watch also spoke to medical personnel in the West Bank and reviewed medical records, verified videos posted on social media, and news reports. Human Rights Watch wrote to the Israel Defense Forces on August 8, 2023, and April 23, 2024, with questions about the eight fatalities and the military\u2019s rules regarding the use of force, but has not received a reply to either query.\nHuman Rights Watch has also released a question-and-answer document on the international legal framework applicable to violence and the use of force in the West Bank.\nIn one case that Human Rights Watch investigated, Israeli forces in Jenin repeatedly fired upon Sidqi Zakarneh, who was crawling injured on the ground, killing him. Videos showed that he was not participating in violence and did not appear to have weapons. In another case, in the northern West Bank, family members said Rafiq Ghannem went out apparently unarmed early one morning to investigate loud noises. He encountered Israeli forces, who fatally shot him when he tried to flee.\nIsraeli forces in 2023 killed 492 Palestinians, including 120 children, in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). That figure is more than twice as many as in any other year since the UN began systematically documenting fatalities. About 300 were killed in the nearly three months following the October 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, though the increase in killings dates back to 2022. Between January 1 and March 31, 2024, Israeli forces killed 131 Palestinians in the West Bank.\nIn 2023, Palestinians killed 25 Israeli civilians in the West Bank, the highest figure in at least 15 years, and 5 members of the Israeli armed forces, according to OCHA.\nPalestinians have been at risk of being killed by Israeli security forces throughout the West Bank, whether traveling to and from work or in their own neighborhoods. Children on their way to school have been fatally shot, as Human Rights Watch documented in August 2023. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz found that in 2022, in only 45 percent of incidents in which Palestinians were killed did the Israeli military even allege that the victims were armed or that there were \u201cclashes in which there was an exchange of gunfire.\u201d\nBetween October 7, 2023, and March 18, 2024, Israeli forces conducted a monthly average of 640 search-and-arrest and other operations in the West Bank, nearly double the 340 such operations during the first nine months of 2023, according to OCHA. These operations resulted in the killing of 304 Palestinians, out of a total of 409 killed by Israeli forces during this period.\nDuring a search-and-arrest operation near the West Bank city of Tulkarem on October 19, Israeli forces shot and killed 15-year-old Taha Mahamid and, minutes later, wounded his father, Ibrahim, who went to retrieve his body. Video and other evidence shows no sign that either was carrying a weapon. Ibrahim Mahamid died of his injuries four months later. Witnesses said, and video footage supported, that the shootings occurred at a time when there were no active confrontations in the area and neither Taha nor his father posed any imminent threat to Israeli forces.\nIsraeli security forces in the West Bank are bound by international human rights law. The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials provide thatthe \u201cintentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.\u201d\nIsrael does not make public the rules on the use of force that it applies to the army. However, in the cases documented by Human Rights Watch, Israeli military personnel engaged in law enforcement used lethal force when it was not strictly unavoidable to protect life, including firing on people who were fleeing or were considered to be linked to clashes or possible violent acts.\nRepeated unlawful killings and endemic impunity are among the inhumane acts that make up the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution that Israeli authorities commit against Palestinians, as Human Rights Watch and other rights groups have documented.\nGovernments should suspend arms and other military support to Israel because of the risk of complicity in grave abuses in Palestine, take action to ensure accountability including supporting the International Criminal Court\u2019s probe into serious crimes committed in Palestine, and impose targeted sanctions against those responsible for grave abuses.\n\u201cThe Israeli government\u2019s permissive and discriminatory practices on the use of force and endemic impunity are one facet of the apartheid and structural violence Palestinians face every day,\u201d Weir said. \u201cThe unlawful killings in the West Bank will continue so long as the Israeli authorities\u2019 systemic repression of Palestinians continues.\u201d\nFor details on Human Rights Watch investigations into killings of Palestinians by Israeli forces, please see below.\nImpunity for Unlawful Use of Lethal Force\nHuman Rights Watch has previously documented that some senior Israeli officials have encouraged soldiers and police to kill Palestinians suspected of attacking Israelis, even when they are no longer a threat. *Haaretz *reported that since \u201cDecember 2021, soldiers are allowed to shoot at Palestinians who are fleeing if they had previously thrown stones or Molotov cocktails.\u201d In April 2022, then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said there would be \u201cno restrictions\u201d on Israeli forces\u2019 response to Palestinian violence. In October 2022, Itamar Ben-Gvir, now the national security minister, said while running for election that it should be legal to use lethal force against anyone throwing stones.\nSuch statements, coupled with the lack of accountability for abuses, contribute to a permissive environment for security forces to unlawfully use lethal force, Human Rights Watch said.\nDespite decades of frequent unlawful killings of Palestinians in policing situations, Israeli authorities continue to use tactics that contravene international human rights norms. Israeli security forces do not use a similar pattern of unlawful lethal force against Jewish Israelis, even during disruptive demonstrations, including by West Bank settlers, that involve stone-throwing and blocking roads. This indicates that Israeli authorities use of unlawful excessive force is discriminatory and is used to further their policy of maintaining domination by Jewish Israelis over Palestinians.\nThe Israeli rights group Yesh Din found that between 2017 and 2021, fewer than one percent of complaints of violations by Israeli forces against Palestinians, including killings and other abuses, resulted in criminal indictments. During the same period, Yesh Din found that only three soldiers were convicted for killing Palestinians, and all received short sentences of military community service. The Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem, which for years filed claims and reported on the military justice system, have characterized the military\u2019s internal law enforcement system as a \u201cwhitewash mechanism.\u201d\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, has confirmed that his office has, since March 2021, been conducting an invesetigation into serious crimes committed in Palestine since 2014.\nCases of Killings of Palestinians\nTaha and Ibrahim Mahamid, Nur Shams, October 19, 2023\nOn October 19, 2023, just before 3:30 a.m., as captured in a voice note sent by a local resident, sirens went off in Nur Shams refugee camp, in Tulkarem in the northern West Bank, warning residents that the Israeli military was preparing to enter the camp. At 3:31 a.m., as confirmed in a video that Human Rights Watch verified, 15-year-old Taha Mahamid was approaching Nablus Street, the main street in front of his home in the al-Malash neighborhood in the camp, near its entrance, when at least two bullets struck him.\nTaha\u2019s sister Sara, who filmed the video, told Human Rights Watch that, after hearing the sirens, she opened her bedroom window to observe what was happening. Sara saw Taha outside with their neighbor and asked Taha what he was doing. \u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see the [military] jeeps and come back up.\u201d She said he was holding only a cellphone.\nThe video shows two males, one identified as Taha, stepping cautiously toward Nablus Street in Nur Shams from Taha\u2019s home. As he approaches the main road, Taha turns his body to the right to look east along Nablus Street. One second later a shot is heard and Taha collapses to the ground. Two more shots ring out, and Taha lies there motionless. No Israeli forces or armed Palestinians were in the area, Sara said. The video shows no sign of an active confrontation or of Taha carrying a weapon of any kind.\nThe preliminary forensic medical report by the Martyr Dr. Thabet Hospital in Tulkarem recorded that Taha was dead when he was brought by ambulance to the emergency room of the hospital. It states that two bullets hit Taha in the front of his body \u201cfrom below the right eye\u201d and that they \u201cexited from the back of the head,\u201d indicating that the shots were most likely fired from the direction in which Taha was looking.\nMinutes after Taha was shot, his father, Ibrahim Mahamid, 58, left the house and went toward Taha. He told Human Rights Watch that he could not bear the sight of his son bleeding on the ground or the thought of Israeli forces taking him. When he reached Taha, a bullet struck the father in the abdomen, he said and medical reports confirmed. Videos reviewed by Human Rights Watch show him next to Taha, rolling over in an attempt to stand up, until a neighbor arrives and helps him to reach his house.\nSara made two phone calls to the Palestinian Red Cresent Society, at 3:37 a.m. and 3:43 a.m., requesting ambulances. The neighbor, a volunteer paramedic, also called for ambulances. The Red Crescent informed them that ambulances would not be able to immediately reach them, as Israeli forces were blocking entry to the camp.\nAn ambulance arrived at the scene at 4:44 a.m., more than an hour after Taha had been shot, according to a video Sara shared and that Human Rights Watch verified. About 10 minutes later, another ambulance came for Ibrahim Mahamid. \u201cAll this time, there was absolutely nothing outside,\u201d Sara said. \u201cNo sound, no movement \u2026 no one came to him.\u201d She said that Taha lay motionless, with blood around his head.\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights documented that Israeli authorities \u201cprevented Palestinian paramedics from accessing the injured\u201d during the October 19 raid, which the office said \u201creflect[s] a growing pattern.\u201d This obstruction could have denied Ibrahim Mahamid and possibly his son access to life-saving medical care, Human Rights Watch said.\nIbrahim Mahamid succumbed to his injuries on February 29, OCHA reported. A death certificate from the Palestinian Interior Ministry, signed by the Health Ministry, identified \u201caspiration, septic shock,\u201d as a result of an \u201cabdominal bullet injury,\u201d as the cause of death.\nHuman Rights Watch concluded, based on its research, that Israeli forces shot both Taha and Ibrahim Mahamid. The shootings occurred at the entrance to the camp, at about the time that Israeli forces entered the camp. Residents said that Israeli forces had a practice of taking positions in and atop buildings in the camp to provide cover for troops to enter. As far as Human Rights Watch could determine, while Israeli authorities made no statement regarding the shooting of Taha and Ibrahim Mahamid, the Israeli military said that they had killed \u201cmore than 12 terrorists\u201d in Nur Shams camp during the entire operation.\nThe Israeli military operation in Nur Shams camp that day lasted 27 hours, according to OCHA, resulting in the death of 14 Palestinians, including 6 children. The Israeli military said that its Duvdevan Unit of the Commando Brigade and its Duchifat Battalion and Sayeret Haruv of the Kfir Brigade carried out the operation, alongside the Israeli Border Police, including its Yamas Unit, which conducts covert and special operations. Israeli authorities said the operation in the camp was intended to \u201carrest wanted persons, destroy terrorist infrastructure, and confiscate weapons.\u201d They said a member of the Yamas Unit of the Border Police was killed during the operation. They have not indicated that they are investigating the deaths, including those of Taha or Ibrahim Mahamid.\nThere was no apparent basis for shooting Taha and Ibrahim Mahamid, Human Rights Watch found. They posed no imminent threat to life or serious injury, making their killings unlawful.\nDuring a subsequent 50-hour Israeli military incursion in Nur Shams on April 18-20, Israeli forces killed 14 Palestinians and severely damaged infrastructure in the refugee camp, OCHA reported.\nAtta Shalabi, Sidqi Zakarneh, and Tareq Damaj, Jenin, December 8, 2022\nAt about 5 a.m. on December 8, 2022, Israeli forces shot dead three Palestinian men on a main road in the middle of Jenin city, while Israeli forces conducted a search-and-arrest raid nearby. Video verified by Human Rights Watch indicates that Sidqi Zakarneh, 29, Tareq Damaj, 29, and Atta Shalabi, 46, were all seemingly unarmed.\nZakarneh was shot as he approached an intersection near where the raid was taking place and then, after being seriously wounded, was shot repeatedly as he tried to crawl away. Damaj and Shalabi were both shot apparently after they stopped near where Zakarneh had been shot. Israeli forces were apparently deployed in a caf\u00e9 on the second floor of a building that overlooked an intersection about 50 meters from where the arrest raid was taking place.\nHuman Rights Watch verified and reviewed six videos on social media that show: Zakarneh and Damaj being shot; the apparent moment when Shalabi was shot and Shalabi\u2019s motionless body; men dragging Shalabi away; and Israeli forces exiting the area following the killings.\nThe first shooting took place as Zakarneh and two other men were leaving a car parked on Al-Malek Faysal Street about 25 meters north of the intersection with Al-Nahda Street. A closed-circuit television video posted online shows Zakarneh being wounded by gunfire a few meters from the car. One man flees north, away from the intersection and the nearby raid. Zakarneh begins to slowly crawl on his stomach back toward the vehicle, and then at least two successive shots can be seen striking him, apparently in the head. At no time does it appear that Zakarneh or the men he was with were openly carrying weapons or engaged in acts of violence.\nIn a closed-circuit television (CCTV) video filmed just after Zakarneh was shot, another vehicle pulls alongside the car that carried Zakarneh. The driver, whom a witness later identified as Damaj, exits the vehicle and can be seen approaching cars driving on Al-Malek Faysal Street, near where Zakarneh lies, gesturing in his direction. As Damaj approaches Zakarneh, he is shot repeatedly and falls to the ground. The other vehicles in the area speed away, leaving the two men motionless in the street. From the videos alone, it is not clear where the shots originated.\nThe witness who identified Damaj said that minutes after Damaj was shot, the witness approached the scene, driving behind an ambulance to help recover the men. \u201cWhen we got out of the car, we saw two martyrs, their bodies full of bullet holes, especially in their heads,\u201d he said.\nThe witness said that while he and medics from the ambulance attempted to move one of the men, bullets struck the area around them. They could not confirm the direction from which the bullets came. The witness said he and the medics fled after managing to get one of the men into the ambulance. The witness said he did not see any weapons on or near the men.\nAt the same time, several men, including Shalabi and his brother, were near the intersection, as seen in a CCTV video verified by Human Rights Watch. At one point in the video, Shalabi approaches the ambulance, then walks back toward Al-Nahda Street and out of view of CCTV cameras. Seconds after he disappears from view, a man nearby is seen flinching and running for cover, apparently under gunfire.\nThe video then shows Shalabi\u2019s brother running from where he and Shalabi had just moved out of view. Two videos posted online show Shalabi face down on Al-Nahda Street. One of these then shows Shalabi\u2019s brother dragging his body back toward Al-Malek Faysal Street, in view of the CCTV cameras. At no time do any of the videos show anyone carrying weapons, weapons near the bodies of those shot, or anyone engaging in acts of violence.\nShalabi was shot immediately below the caf\u00e9 that Israeli forces were apparently occupying during the raid. Shalabi\u2019s motionless body is just a few meters from a door to a stairway that leads up to the caf\u00e9. Human Rights Watch visited the site and saw that the large door had been damaged. Residents said the damage occurred when Israeli forces forced it open on the morning of the raid. One shop worker said that he reviewed his CCTV camera footage after the raid from early that morning, which showed Israeli forces driving past the entrance and then returning. Human Rights Watch did not review this footage.\nThe location of the victims\u2019 bodies, impacts visible in videos circulated online, and damage on the asphalt are consistent with small arms fire coming from an elevated position on the corner where the caf\u00e9 is located.\nShortly thereafter, a witness who was helping to recover the body on Al-Malek Faysal Street said, Israeli armored vehicles drove up and stopped near the intersection with Al-Nahda Street. A CCTV video posted online also shows Israeli forces pulling up in multiple armored vehicles, with seven members of the armed forces coming from Al-Nahda Street just meters from the entrance to a stairwell that leads to the caf\u00e9. All seven armed forces personnel are seen boarding one of the armored vehicles through its rear doors.\nHuman Rights Watch visited the site where the men were killed and identified damage on the asphalt consistent with small arms fire in the locations where a witness said the three men were shot. Videos circulated on social media show the men shot or lying apparently dead in positions consistent with the damage on the asphalt that Human Rights Watch observed.\nFollowing the killings, the Israeli military released a statement about its operations in Jenin city, saying that during an operation to arrest two suspects, the soldiers were \u201ctargeted with direct fire and responded with live fire, hits were identified.\u201d They said that they had confiscated a weapon used by one of the suspects.\nThe Jenin branch of the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad made a statement following the raid in Jenin claiming to have attacked Israeli troops with gunfire and explosives. They do not specify the location or time of the attacks. Human Rights Watch found no evidence that Shalabi, Zakarneh, or Damaj were engaged in any acts of violence.\nThe totality of the video and witness evidence shows that Zarkaneh, Damaj, and Shalabi did not present an imminent threat to life or serious injury in the moments leading up to when Israeli forces shot and killed them. At no time immediately prior to their killings did any of these men appear to possess or use weapons. The men\u2019s conduct, as captured on video, does not show them engaged in violent acts, nor does it show Israeli forces attempting to exercise restraint. Instead, Israeli forces appear to have immediately intentionally used firearms, in violation of international norms.\nFollowing the killings, the Palestinian armed group Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade claimed Zakarneh as a member and a \u201cfighter,\u201d while Islamic Jihad\u2019s Al-Quds Brigade claimed that Damaj was a member. There is no further information about the extent of their respective memberships and their activities. Photos and posts circulated online before and after the incident show the two men posing with rifles. Shalabi does not appear to have participated in any armed group.\nRegardless, membership or the past activities of Zakarneh and Damaj in any group is not a relevant factor in determining the standards on the intentional lethal use of force or firearms by forces acting in a law enforcement role. If Israeli authorities had a legal basis to arrest the men, the security forces could have acted to take them into custody and, depending on their response, used the minimal force necessary to achieve a legitimate law enforcement objective.\nThe repeated shooting of Zakarneh while he crawled on the ground injured and posed no imminent threat and the shooting of the other men likely amount to extrajudicial killings outside of the existing legal framework.\nJawad Rimawi and Thafer Rimawi, Kafr Ein, November 29, 2022\nOn November 29, 2022, Israeli forces on patrol in the village of Kafr Ein, northwest of Ramallah, shot and killed the brothers Jawad Rimawi, 22, and Thafer Rimawi, 21, who were from nearby Beit Rima. They and other Palestinians had confronted an Israeli armored vehicle convoy with rock-throwing and an apparent \u201cMolotov cocktail\u201d (gasoline bomb). After being shot, the brothers were taken in private vehicles to a nearby hospital, where they died from their injuries.\nEarly that morning, an Israeli convoy of armored vehicles approached Kafr Ein from the east. Witnesses said that Palestinians from nearby villages alerted Kafr Ein residents that forces were heading toward them, and residents awake at the time saw the vehicles approaching. One resident heard a commotion from the center of town, including what he described as gunshots, and began filming from his rooftop.\nThe convoy made its way from the center of Kafr Ein toward its periphery. A witness said that up to four people, including the Rimawis, had also moved there, to the front yard of an unoccupied house along the main road leading out of the village to the south.\nAnother witness said that as the armored vehicles approached this house, people threw rocks at them and attempted to set tires alight on the road. A video shared with and verified by Human Rights Watch shows at least five Israeli armored vehicles passing by the front of the house, where the brothers were in the yard. In the video, the call to prayer can be heard starting, indicating that it was filmed shortly before 5 a.m.\nA bright fireball erupts on or near the house\u2019s front patio, at least 25 meters from the road, as one of the vehicles drives past. A small fire is seen in the yard first, followed by an intense larger fire apparently on the patio that dissipates within seconds. It is unclear if the two fires were ignited with the same material.\nAn independent expert on fire dynamics reviewed the video and concluded that the characteristics of the fires are consistent with the use of an incendiary device like a Molotov cocktail.\nJust after the fireball erupts, nine gunshots are heard on the video. As the gunshots are ringing out, a man\u2019s voice, identified by his family as Thafer\u2019s, is heard screaming for Jawad. Approximately eight seconds after the last of the nine gunshots, a single shot is heard.\nA witness said that Jawad, who was meters away across the yard, was coming to assist his brother when he was shot.\nLess than 10 seconds after this single shot, an Israeli armored vehicle, which now appears in the video in front of the house, continues forward, following the other vehicles in the convoy. The remaining 40 seconds of the video do not show any more vehicles, suggesting that the gunfire came from this vehicle, the last in the patrol. No Israeli personnel appear to be outside of the vehicles at any time, and witnesses said they saw no forces on foot as the vehicles passed.\nHuman Rights Watch found what appeared to be a grouping of bullet holes about 1.5 meters up from the ground in a window on the side of the house where the fireball erupted.\nAfter the shooting, residents raced to the wounded Rimawi brothers, placed them in separate private vehicles and rushed them to a hospital in Salfit, eight kilometers away. Based on interviews with doctors, reviews of medical reports, and witnesses, Thafer was hit by bullets at least twice in the chest. Jawad was hit in the lower abdomen.\nDoctors at the hospital rushed Jawad into surgery and transferred Thafer by ambulance to a specialist hospital in Ramallah.\nJawad died during surgery. A hospital report, which Human Rights Watch viewed, documented a single gunshot entry wound in Jawad\u2019s lower abdomen with no exit wound.\nThafer had no pulse when he arrived at the Ramallah hospital, said his sister Ru\u2019a, who rode in the ambulance with him, and was pronounced dead. A report by the Palestinian Medical Complex said he had \u201cseveral bone wounds in the sternum and lower neck.\u201d A death certificate from the Palestinian Interior Ministry says that Thafer had \u201cmultiple gunshot injuries to the chest.\u201d\nA Molotov cocktail can cause serious injuries or death. However, were one to ignite and burn 25 meters or more from a moving armored military vehicle, it would not place those inside the vehicle at continuing risk.\nOne witness said that when Thafer was shot, he was not throwing a Molotov cocktail. Even if he were involved with the Molotov cocktail attack that had exploded at the house, when Israeli forces shot him, he no longer presented an imminent threat to life or serious injury. There were no Israeli forces on foot in the vicinity and the last armored vehicle was driving away. The use of deadly force against Jawad and Thafer Rimawi by Israeli forces appears unjustified.\nRafiq Ghannam, Jaba, July 6, 2022\nAt about 2:30 a.m. on July 6, 2022, Israeli forces fatally shot Rafiq Ghannam, 20, outside his home in Jaba in the northern West Bank between Jenin and Nablus. His family members said that Ghannam was asleep, his clothes laid out for his workday in Israel, when loud noises outside awakened him. According to residents, Israeli soldiers had surrounded his small neighborhood and were attempting to arrest the Ghannams\u2019 neighbor, who lived on the other side of a high wall to the east that separated the two homes. The Ghannams\u2019 house has a tall steel gate and is next to an olive tree grove at the end of a cul-de-sac, about 100 meters down a road connecting the cul-de-sac to a larger road.\nGhannam got out of bed wearing a white tank-top and brown shorts and put on his sandals. His brother and mother were already awake. Ghannam joined his brother at the gate to their house and peered out. Unable to see anything, Ghannam walked out of the gate. Three people said that they saw him step cautiously from his house; they said they did not see a weapon. As he reached the edge of a neighbor\u2019s house, about 10 meters from his home, there was a simultaneous eruption of gunfire and shouting by Israeli forces, based on witness accounts and a video that Human Rights Watch reviewed.\nWitnesses said several shots were fired as Ghannam approached the corner of his neighbor\u2019s house, where there is an opening to the olive tree grove. At least seven shots can be heard on the video. Human Rights Watch could not establish the direction from which the forces fired and found no evidence that bullets struck the area around where Ghannam was standing, either on the ground or walls, indicating that the shots could have been fired into the air.\nWitnesses said Ghannam ran from the gunfire, down the cul-de-sac leading to the main road. The video has audio of several gunshots and shows an individual who appears to be wearing a helmet and a backpack running in the direction that witnesses said Ghannam ran.\nWitnesses lost sight of Ghannam as he ran down the cul-de-sac but said that shortly after, they saw Israeli forces return to the area around his house and walk back and forth. After the forces left, residents found a large pool of blood at the end of the cul-de-sac nearest to the main road.\nWithin hours, an Israeli intelligence officer called a relative of Ghannam who lived nearby, saying that Israeli forces had Ghannam and would provide information about him if the neighbor they had come to arrest surrendered. Shortly thereafter, the officer called again and told the relative: \u201cI have a present for you.\u201d The authorities had detained the wanted neighbor\u2019s younger brother, gave him Ghannam\u2019s blood-stained cellphone, and then released him. The brother handed the phone to Ghannam\u2019s family.\nAt about 8 a.m., the Palestinian Coordination and Liaison Office informed the family that Ghannam had been killed. Israeli authorities took 21 days to return his body to the family.\nAn autopsy report from the Palestinian National Authority\u2019s Public Prosecution Office notes a 0.5 centimeter wound on Ghannam\u2019s back under the left shoulder, that it assessed as the bullet entry wound, and a 3.5 centimeter wound with irregular edges on Ghannam\u2019s chest, that it assessed as the exit wound. The entry and exit wounds suggest that Ghannam was facing away from his shooter.\nIn a statement released later on July 6, the Israeli military said: \u201cthe force initiated a suspect apprehension procedure, which included opening fire at a suspect who fled from a building, and detected an injury to the suspect. The force provided medical aid to the suspect, but he was later pronounced dead. The circumstances of the case are being investigated.\u201d Haaretz initially reported that the military said Ghannam threw a Molotov cocktail at the forces who had entered his neighborhood to arrest \u201ca terror suspect.\u201d\nA subsequent report by Haaretz indicated that the Israeli forces\u2019 investigation was complete and had been submitted to the military advocate general to decide whether any charges would be brought.\nThe outcome of the investigation has not been disclosed, and there have been no further announcements. The Israeli military did not respond to a Human Rights Watch letter requesting information on the status of the case.\nThere is no evidence that indicates that Rafiq Ghannam engaged in any acts of violence or that he presented an imminent threat of serious injury or death to Israeli forces. The Israeli military said on July 6 that it shot Ghannam because he fled a building and did not stop, an insufficient justification for the use of lethal force under the applicable international standards."}
