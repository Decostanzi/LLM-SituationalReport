Context Setting\nIn mid-April 2023, Sudan descended into a major conflict as clashes between the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in Khartoum and spread across the country. The conflict has led to over 12,000 deaths, extensive damage to infrastructure, and widespread displacement, with more than 6.1 million people forced to flee their homes. Sudan now faces the world\u2019s largest internal and child displacement crisis.\nThis includes 2.3 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries and 10.5 million internally displaced, over half of whom are children and 54% are women. Moreover, as per the 2024 Sudan Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan, 15% of Sudan's population in need (24.8 million people) and targeted (14.7 million people) are persons with disabilities (PWDs) and 5% of the two above mentioned groups are older people.4 They are also at heightened risk of exclusion, sexual and economic exploitation, violence, and abuse. The conflict has severely impacted access to basic services, leading to interruptions in water, healthcare, banking, electricity, and telecommunications, compounded by frequent looting.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in late 2023 showed escalating food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly in conflict zones.6 An IPC alert in March 2024 emphasized the worsening situation and the looming threat of famine in highly vulnerable regions with worsening projections of looming famine demonstrated in the new IPC report. 7 With ongoing conflict, heightened food insecurity and water scarcity, the protection needs of communities will increase, including GBV and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA). Women, girls, men, and boys, in all their diversity, will have distinct needs in assistance and face different barriers to assistance that must be accounted for in emergency programming. In response, the Sudan Famine Prevention Operational Plan was launched, coordinating efforts across Food Security and Livelihoods, Nutrition, Health, WASH, Education, Shelter and NFI clusters, with a focus on protection, gender equality, disability inclusion, and cross-cutting themes such as accountability to affected communities and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA).", "17234": "title: UN to urge action on Sudan crisis \n content: The UN member states will today call for immediate steps to protect civilians, scale up humanitarian funding and access, and end the fighting in Sudan, a press release said.\nThe ministerial meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York will be co-hosted by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency \u2013 alongside Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the US, the African Union, and the European Union.\nThe parties are expected to outline the devastating human toll if the international community fails to take urgent and collective action to stem the humanitarian crisis and stop the fighting in Sudan.\nThe war, pitting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), is entering its 18 month and has occasioned a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.\nThe press release said Sudan is now the world\u2019s largest hunger crisis, with over half of the country\u2019s population \u2013 nearly 26 million people \u2013 facing high levels of acute hunger.

The lack of safe routes out of the city, along with exorbitant costs of leaving, have left many trapped there.\nIn the heaviest recent fighting, on September 20 to 21, at least 20 civilians were killed by artillery shelling near the main market, and many shops were destroyed, the press release says.\n\u201cThe actual number of civilian casualties is believed to be much higher, but telecommunications blackouts have made verification difficult.\u201d\nIn the past two weeks, in addition to rising civilian casualties, the UN Human Rights Office reported documenting cases of summary executions, sexual and gender-based violence, and abductions of at least five women and several young men in El Fasher. There have also been reports of large-scale arbitrary arrests in North and South Darfur by the RSF, who accuse civilians of providing information and coordinates of their locations to the SAF.\nThe press release explained that due to targeted attacks on medical facilities, civilians have been denied access to urgent healthcare, and food supplies were extremely limited.\n\u201cFrom bitter past experience, if El Fasher falls, there is a high risk of ethnically targeted violations and abuses, including summary executions and sexual violence, by the RSF and allied militia,\u201d it quotes T\u00fcrk saying.\nIn particular, he highlighted concerns for residents of Abu Shouk IDP camp, which has come under sustained shelling by the RSF since May, and of Zamzam IDP camp.\n\u201cPeople in those camps are at grave risk of retaliatory attacks based on their tribal identity, real or perceived, as coming from the same communities as leaders of armed movements aligned with the SAF,\u201d T\u00fcrk is further quoted.\n\u201cThe fighting must stop at once.

The UN Security Council convened on Wednesday in New York to discuss the deepening crisis, with Assistant Secretary-General for Africa, Martha Bobby, and Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Joyce Msuya, delivering stark warnings.\nThe 17-month war in Sudan has pushed the country to the brink, with no end in sight. Martha Bobby highlighted the deteriorating situation in El Fasher, where civilians remain trapped under siege.\nShe noted that despite calls for calm, the fighting has intensified, leaving hundreds of thousands at risk of mass violence.\nBobby referred to Security Council Resolution 2736, passed in June, which urged the Rapid Support Forces to cease their blockade of El Fasher. Yet, efforts to de-escalate the violence have failed.\nRamtane Lamamra, the UN Secretary-General's envoy for Sudan, continues efforts to mediate between warring parties, engaging with the Sudanese authorities and international mediators in recent months.\nJoyce Msuya painted a grim picture of the situation in El Fasher. Large-scale fighting, accompanied by heavy artillery and air bombardment, has put civilians, particularly women and children, in grave danger.\nHospitals and civilian infrastructure have been repeatedly hit, leaving only one of the city's three main hospitals partially operational.\nMsuya revealed that the Zamzam camp, home to thousands of internally displaced people, is on the verge of famine, with malnutrition rates soaring. \"One child dies every two hours in Zamzam camp,\" she said, citing a recent report by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\nThe ongoing conflict and severe weather conditions have hampered the delivery of vital humanitarian aid. Roads leading to El Fasher and the Zamzam camp have been cut off since May, and recent flooding has exacerbated the situation.\nDespite these challenges, Msuya remains hopeful that aid deliveries can resume as floodwaters recede.\nShe stressed that the situation in El Fasher mirrors the devastation seen across other regions of Sudan, with Khartoum, Sennar, and El Gezira also heavily affected. Over eight million people have been displaced, and more than two million have fled the country.\nMsuya outlined three urgent steps needed to prevent further catastrophe. First, she called on the warring parties to comply with international humanitarian law and stop targeting civilians. Second, she urged the international community to prevent atrocities like those witnessed in West Darfur from spreading to El Fasher. Finally, she appealed to donors to increase funding, with less than 50 per cent of the $2.7 billion humanitarian appeal met.\nShe concluded by urging the Security Council to act decisively, stating that the upcoming high-level meetings during the General Assembly represent a crucial opportunity to address the conflict and support the people of Sudan.", "27169": "title: Sudan: SPLM-N El Hilu - 'Over Three Million People Face Famine in Southern Sudan, Aid Obstructed' \n content: Kauda \u2014 The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdelaziz El Hilu (SPLM-N El Hilu) in South Kordofan and Blue Nile state, reported the death of more than 400 people due to hunger within a month.

As M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res continues to provide medical services across the country, we face enormous challenges.\nFirst, humanitarian access continues to be obstructed by both warring parties. In one simple example, in North Darfur, RSF forces have prevented us from reaching Zamzam camp and providing life-saving assistance for months, where a third of the children are acutely malnourished and over 7,000 are at the risk of death. Opening the Adre crossing is a step, but it is not enough.

Health facilities have been shelled, looted, and occupied, and health care workers are attacked, harassed, and intimidated. This violence results in enormous loss of life and severely limits our ability to function effectively. We demand that all parties to the conflict protect civilians and halt attacks on health infrastructure, and ensure the safety of medical and humanitarian personnel. Finally, the international community must scale up the delivery of humanitarian assistance.\nWe need to streamline processes to expedite the movement of aid. We need humanitarian organizations to manage risk, to ensure their presence, and predictably move supplies across the country, including food, vaccines, and medical supplies.

Women and girls are enduring the most brutal impact of this conflict and facing multiple forms of sexual violence, while reports of men and boys being subjected to sexual violence are also on the rise.\nRecent reports from Khartoum and Al Jazira indicate a disturbing rise in cases of women and girls being abducted and subjected to rape, forced marriage, and sexual captivity. We have also witnessed a staggering 288 per cent increase in the number of survivors seeking gender-based violence (GBV) case management services during the first seven months of 2024. These figures, while alarming, represent only a small fraction of the true scale and prevalence of this violence, which is believed to be far more widespread and devastating for women and girls across the country. We are also seeing alarming cases of sexual exploitation driven by food insecurity and water scarcity, along with severely limited access to essential post-rape care and support services for survivors.\nWomen-led national organizations and female humanitarian workers are at the forefront of responding to these violations, providing life-saving services and support to survivors in some of the most affected and hard-to-reach areas. Their work is vital in ensuring that the needs of women and girls are met, despite the debilitating challenges posed by the ongoing conflict and insecurity. It is alarming that their safety and continued presence in these areas are increasingly jeopardized, as they face targeted attacks.\nWe unequivocally condemn the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and any actions that threaten the physical and psychological well-being and integrity of women, girls, men and boys, and humanitarian workers. Sexual violence is a severe violation of human rights and international humanitarian law. We call on all parties to the conflict to cease all acts of violence, including sexual violence, and to uphold their legal obligations under international humanitarian law, particularly protection of civilians and respect for humanitarian action and providers.\nWe further urge the authorities, at both national and local levels where they hold influence, to take immediate action to safeguard the lives, dignity, and well-being of women, girls, men and boys, sexual violence survivors, and female humanitarian workers. All parties to the conflict must ensure unimpeded humanitarian access to post-rape care and protection support.\nIn solidarity with survivors and those assisting them, the HCT reaffirms its unwavering commitment and support to combating the rising trends of CRSV and strengthening our collective humanitarian response. We must work together to protect the most vulnerable and ensure that no survivor of sexual violence is left behind in this crisis.\nThe HCT in Sudan is composed of United Nations Agencies, Funds, and Programmes, along with national and international Non-Governmental Organizations.\nFor more information, please contact: ochasudan@un.org or tashtankulov@un.org\n26 September 2024\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|", "31442": "title: South Sudan laments dire impact of Sudan war on its oil export \n content: Foreign Minister Ramdan Goc told the UN General Assembly that the International Community must stand with South Sudan and double its efforts in resolving the Sudan conflict which has affected the country\u2019s chief crude oil export.\nReading out a statement on behalf of the government of South Sudan on Thursday, Minister Goc stated that his country\u2019s economy has been ruined by the ongoing conflict between Sudanese military factions.\n\u201cIt is worth mentioning that the conflict in the Republic of Sudan has directly impacted the economic situation in South Sudan, with oil production significantly reduced since April this year,\u201d he said.\nSouth Sudan is suffering from catastrophic inflation after the Sudan war put its financial lifeline at risk, especially after one of the pipelines transporting 60% of its crude oil broke down in February 2024.\nOn September 16, President Salva Kiir and the Chairman of Sudan\u2019s Sovereign Council, Abdel Fattah Al Burhan discussed resumption of oil exports through Sudan, following four months of repairs on the oil infrastructure.\n\u201cGiven the fact that our economy is entirely reliant on revenue from the sale of our crude oil transported through Port Sudan on the Red Sea, we urge the international community to double its efforts toward resolving the conflict in Sudan,\u201d Goc said.\n\u201cWe further call for more solidarity with South Sudan as it struggles to overcome and withstand the dire economic impacts created by the conflict in Sudan.\u201d\nThe dwindling oil export is not the only problem resulting from the conflict in Sudan as the crisis the north has burdened the country with an influx of 800,000 people including refugees and returnees.\nWhile commending the efforts of UN and humanitarian agencies working to alleviate the suffering of the victims of this conflict, Minister Goc said his government strongly encourages support for an IGAD initiative to bring about peace to Sudan.\n\u201cWe also believe that the international community\u2019s support for the victims of the war remains inadequate and unresponsive to the impact on the host communities that are also grappling with serious humanitarian challenges.\u201d\nThe conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) under General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan and RSF of General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, erupted in April 15, 2023, and has killed an estimated 150,000 people, displaced 10 million others and triggered one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.\nOn Thursday, September 26, the army reportedly launched a major offensive characterized by heavy bombardment in the capital, Khartoum, in a bid to regain areas under the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\nFour people were killed during artillery shelling by RSF after the army warplanes carried out air strikes in the capital and north of Khartoum in its biggest such assault in months, Al Jazeera news outlet reported.\nThe Sudanese army is also said to have taken took control of three main bridges, including two that connect the city of Omdurman with the capital, Khartoum after attacking military sites belonging to RSF.\nPublished 8 hours ago\nPublished 9 hours ago\nPublished 9 hours ago\nPublished 9 hours ago\nPublished 10 hours ago\nPublished 10 hours ago\nSupport Eye Radio, the first independent radio broadcaster of news, information & entertainment in South Sudan.\nMake a monthly or a one off contribution.\nCopyright 2024.

The lengthy document emphasized the close U.S.-UAE partnership, and in the sixth paragraph under the heading \"Partners in a Stable, Integrated, and Prosperous Middle East and Wider Region,\" the statement noted the leaders' shared concern and alarm about the crisis in Sudan, stressed that \"there can be no military solution\" and called for accountability for atrocities and war crimes.\nIt all sounds laudable, until one recalls the evidence indicating that the UAE has been supporting one of the antagonists in Sudan's conflict--the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF is more like a criminal mob than a political force. There is no realistic scenario in which the RSF governs anything like a stable Sudan. Atrocities are the RSF's calling card. The undisciplined, marauding force is responsible for sexual violence on a massive scale and ethnic cleansing. Despite months of pleas from the African Union and the United Nations, the RSF continues its assault on El Fasher, the last major population center in Darfur not under its control.\nIt gets worse. As the New York Times reported on September 21, the UAE is not just supporting the RSF with weapons, financing, and drones, it is doing so under the cover of providing humanitarian support for the Sudanese people, sullying the credibility of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, and as the Times put it, \"publicly pledging to ease Sudan's suffering even as it secretly inflames it.\" That suffering is almost unimaginable in scale. Some twelve million people have been forced to flee their homes. Civilians are starving to death because neither party to the conflict takes seriously their obligation to allow for humanitarian access. Food security experts believe that millions of Sudanese may die due to famine in the months ahead.\nWhy make Washington party to the UAE's grotesque charade with a statement that suggests we are aligned partners for peace? How does the United States intend to hold the parties to the conflict accountable for the broken promises that have plagued mediation efforts when our government, too, makes statements that do not square with the facts? How would the U.S. government like Sudanese civilians, exhausted by nearly a year and a half of war, massive displacement, and imminent famine to understand its embrace of the UAE?\nOne hopes that that the alternative reality described in the White House statement was part of the price of extracting a real commitment on the part of the UAE to stop pouring gasoline on the flames engulfing Sudan. On September 24, one day after his meeting with bin Zayed, President Biden told the United Nations General Assembly that, \"the world needs to stop arming the generals, to speak with one voice and tell them: Stop tearing your country apart. Stop blocking aid to the Sudanese people. End this war now.\" One hopes that he echoed that message to the Emirati leader behind closed doors, despite the rosy read-out. But in the absence of any evidence that this is so, it just makes Biden's UN exhortation seem cynical. Read together, the two statements come across as a terrible betrayal, and a willingness to join a wealthy Gulf state in gaslighting the rest of the world.", "32291": "title: Sudan: UN Gender Alert - Sudan Crisis Doubled Violence Against Women and Girls \n content: Nairobi \u2014 The war in Sudan, which resulted in the largest internal displacement crisis in the world, has catastrophic impacts on women and girls, UN Women reported in a new Gender Alert on Thursday.\nThe number of people in need of gender-based violence-related services has increased by 100 percent since the war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in mid-April 2023.

More vaccination campaigns are expected to be rolled out in other affected states.\nCholera was officially declared an outbreak on August 12 by the health ministry after a new wave of cases was reported starting July 22. The disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfalls and floods, especially in eastern Sudan which sheltered millions of people displaced by the conflict between the Sudanese military and the RSF.\nCholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhoea, leading to severe dehydration and could be fatal if not immediately treated, according to WHO.

The lack of safe routes out of the city, along with exorbitant costs and payments required to leave, have left many trapped there.\n\u201cOver the past two weeks, the battle for El Fasher has escalated significantly and we have documented increasing incidents of civilians being killed as a result of shelling and airstrikes by both the RSF and the SAF,\u201d said T\u00fcrk.\nIn the heaviest recent fighting, on 20 to 21 September, at least 20 civilians were killed by artillery shelling near the main market, and many shops were destroyed. The actual number of civilian casualties is believed to be much higher, but telecommunications blackouts have made verification difficult.\nIn the past two weeks, in addition to rising civilian casualties, the UN Human Rights Office has documented cases of summary executions, sexual and gender-based violence, and reported abductions of at least five women and several young men in El Fasher. There have also been reports of large-scale arbitrary arrests in North and South Darfur by the RSF who accuse civilians of providing information and coordinates of their locations to the SAF.\nDue to targeted attacks on medical facilities, civilians also have been denied access to urgent healthcare, and food supplies are extremely limited.\n\u201cFrom bitter past experience, if El Fasher falls, there is a high risk of ethnically targeted violations and abuses, including summary executions and sexual violence, by the RSF and allied militia,\u201d T\u00fcrk added.\nIn particular, he highlighted concerns for residents of Abu Shouk IDP camp, which has come under sustained shelling by the RSF since May, and of Zamzam IDP camp. \u201cPeople in those camps are at grave risk of retaliatory attacks based on their tribal identity, real or perceived, as coming from the same communities as leaders of armed movements aligned with the SAF,\u201d T\u00fcrk said.\nThe High Commissioner pointed to the findings of monitoring missions to eastern Chad by the UN Human Rights Office which documented horrific patterns of ethnically targeted violations and abuses, specifically against the Masalit community, after the RSF took control of El Geneina and Ardamata in West Darfur in June and November 2023.\nT\u00fcrk also highlighted concerns about the escalation of hostilities and increasing civilian casualties in other parts of the country, including in greater Khartoum and in Sennar state.\n\u201cThe fighting must stop at once. Enough is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition to their obligations under international humanitarian law, the parties to this conflict must also live up to the commitments accepted in the Jeddah Declaration to protect civilians and engage in good faith with mediation efforts.\n\u201cI also call on the international community, including through the Security Council, to take necessary, effective action to protect civilians in Sudan, notably those groups at special risk of targeted violence, and to ensure respect for international law by all parties.\u201d\nFor more information and media requests, please contact:\nIn Geneva\nRavina Shamdasani - + 41 22 917 9169 / ravina.shamdasani@un.org\nLiz Throssell - + 41 22 917 9296 / elizabeth.throssell@un.org\nJeremy Laurence - +41 22 917 9383 / jeremy.laurence@un.org\nTag and share\nTwitter @UNHumanRights\nFacebook unitednationshumanrights\nInstagram @unitednationshumanrights", "34947": "title: Sudan surpasses 100 attacks on healthcare since 2023 armed conflict began \n content: WHO believes the number of attacks is likely much higher than what is currently verifiable\nCairo, September 24, 2024 - The number of attacks on healthcare facilities in Sudan since the onset of the armed conflict in April 2023 has exceeded 100, with 108 incidents verified by WHO until mid-September.\nWHO believes that the number of attacks is likely much higher than what is currently verifiable. The ongoing\u2014and, in some areas, worsening\u2014violence hinders our ability to independently verify both attacks and casualties.\nDr. Hanan Balkhy, Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, emphasised how difficult it is to ascertain the true scale of the impact on healthcare. \u201cFor each attack, there is a human cost that is borne by the entire community,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn times of extreme violence, as we are unfortunately witnessing in Sudan today, it becomes even more crucial to have a functional health system.

Countless people suffer from war injuries, extreme hunger, debilitating mental health stress, rising disease outbreaks and inadequate treatment or medical supplies for non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and heart and kidney disease.\nPrior to the current crisis, Sudan had an estimated 6,500 primary healthcare facilities and 300 public hospitals across the country. WHO estimates that 70 \u2013 80% of health facilities in areas worst affected by conflict, such as Al Jazirah, Kordofan, Darfur and Khartoum, and about 45% in other parts of the country, are now barely operational or closed, impacting millions of people living through one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory.\nUnder international humanitarian law, medical facilities and health workers are granted special protection in times of conflict, to ensure the delivery of life-saving care to civilians and to safeguard the health infrastructure vital to community survival.\nA pediatrician* at a hospital in Khartoum said health workers have never felt so unsafe. \"We live in constant fear, not knowing when the next attack might happen. We are doing our best to continue serving the community, but the challenges are immense.\u201d\nAs always, WHO calls for all parties to the conflict in Sudan to respect and protect health care.

At least 80 per cent of the internally displaced women are unable to secure clean water due to affordability, safety concerns, and distance. The education crisis in Sudan is another devastating result of the conflict. Over 2.5 million girls, representing 74 per cent of school-aged girls, are currently out of school, increasing their risk of being subjected to harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation.\n\u201cWomen and girls in Sudan are facing unimaginable challenges, yet their strength and resilience continue to inspire us. We cannot let Sudan become a forgotten crisis. Now, more than ever, the international community must rally together to support women in Sudan, ensuring they have the resources and protection they need to survive and rebuild their lives,\u201d said Hodan Addou, acting Regional Director for UN Women\u2019s East and Southern Africa office.\nAction must be taken urgently to ensure the physical protection of women and girls as well as secure access to food, safe water, and sexual and reproductive health services. UN Women is supporting community-based initiatives, in partnership with women-led organizations, building resilience and ensuring access to critical humanitarian services for women, men, girls, and boys affected by the crisis. UN Women urges the international community, donors, and humanitarian partners to prioritize the protection and empowerment of Sudanese women and girls, including through the increase of funding for local women-led organizations, which received only 1.63 per cent of the Sudan Humanitarian Fund\u2019s financial resources in 2023.\nUN Women stands with the people of Sudan during this deteriorating humanitarian crisis and calls for an immediate halt to the war and a return to the negotiating table for peace dialogues.\nFor more information, please read the full publication:\nhttps://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2024/09/gender-alert-women-and-girls-of-sudan-fortitude-amid-the-flame-of-war", "35937": "title: Sudan: Flooding and Armed Conflict Aggravates Sudan's Cholera Epidemic \n content: United Nations \u2014 Sudan has been plunged into a deadly cholera outbreak in the midst of the Sudanese Civil War. Sudan is currently home to an approximate 15 million people, many of which have had to bear the brunt of hostilities between warring parties, widespread food insecurity, mass displacement, and extreme weather anomalies. Flooding, in particular, has been very damaging, leading to the collapse of critical infrastructures that ensure sanitation. This has caused the cholera outbreak to become a national concern.\nOn August 12th, Sudan's Federal Ministry of Health officially declared the emergence of a cholera outbreak. This is the second cholera outbreak observed in Sudan since the start of the war sixteen months ago.\nBetween July 22 and September 15, there have been approximately 8,457 cases of infections. Sudan's Health Ministry reports that approximately 430 people were killed by cholera in the last month alone, emphasizing a rapid rise in infection rates.\nAccording to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), regions of Sudan that primarily host displacement shelters have been hit hardest by the outbreak.\nSignificant overcrowding and exposure to contaminated water by flooding have exacerbated the transmission of disease.\n\"The recent cholera outbreak has resurged after several weeks of heavy rainfall and resulting flooding. Risks are compounded by the continuing conflict and dire humanitarian conditions, including overcrowding in camps and gathering sites for refugees and Sudanese displaced by the war\", stated UNHCR Representative in Sudan, Kristine Hambrouck.\nDespite these efforts, there have been significant access challenges for medical personnel and aid workers. The persistence of warfare in cholera-affected regions have raised security concerns and have greatly impeded critical routes for aid deliveries.\nThe medical charity, Doctors Without Borders, informed reporters that their current initiatives are \"regularly obstructed by both warring parties, the humanitarian response remains far below what is needed\". They add that armed conflict has led to the collapse of Sudan's health system, with pregnant women and children dying at rapid rates.\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) adds that armed conflict has severely hampered vaccination attempts. Studies show that before the Sudanese Civil War, about 85 percent of the population was vaccinated, plummeting to 50 percent after the war. Areas that are plunged in conflict average about 30 percent immunization.\nFurthermore, according to the Country Director for the World Food Programme (WFP), Eddie Rowe, due to heavy rains and flooding, it has been immensely difficult for aid trucks to pass through the Tina crossing at the Chad border, which is the direct path to reach Darfur, one of Sudan's most vulnerable regions.\nThe United Nations (UN) is currently on the frontlines in severely affected areas, providing life saving medical assistance as well as critical resources to mitigate the spread. UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) are distributing oral rehydration packets and water sanitation tablets to mitigate the spread of cholera through drinking water.\nUNHCR has set up treatment facilities in Kassala to provide the Sudanese with effective treatment and isolation for highly contagious patients. Furthermore, they are training healthcare workers, tracking the spread of infections, and conducting workshops and information campaigns to teach Sudanese civilians safe hygiene practices.\nUNHCR estimates that approximately 1.5 billion dollars will be required to provide aid to Sudan and its neighbouring territories facing similar humanitarian crises. Currently, only 22 percent of that goal has been met. The UN urges further donor contributions as infection rates and civilian deaths are on the rise.", "37048": "title: Cholera is spreading in Sudan as fighting between rival generals shows no sign of abating \n content: Cholera is spreading in Sudan as fighting between rival generals shows no sign of abating\nCholera is spreading in Sudan as fighting between rival generals shows no sign of abating\nFILE -People line up in front of a bakery during a cease-fire in Khartoum, Sudan, May 27, 2023.

(AP Photo)\nCAIRO (AP) \u2014 Cholera is spreading in war-torn Sudan, killing at least 388 people and sickening about 13,000 others over the past two months, health authorities said, as more than 17 months of fighting between the military and a notorious paramilitary group shows no sign of abating.\nThe disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfall and floods especially in eastern Sudan where millions of war displaced people sheltered.\nThe casualties from cholera included six dead and about 400 sickened over the weekend, according to Sunday\u2019s report by the Health Ministry. The disease was detected in 10 of the country\u2019s 18 provinces with the eastern Kassala and al-Qadarif provinces the most hit, the ministry said.\nCholera is a fast-developing, highly contagious infection that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and possible death within hours when not treated, according to the World Health Organization. It is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.\nThe disease is not uncommon in Sudan. A previous major outbreak left at least 700 dead and sickened about 22,000 in less than two months in 2017.\nSudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country.\nThe fighting, which wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups.\nIt has killed at least 20,000 people and wounded tens of thousands others, according to the U.N. However, rights groups and activists say the toll was much higher.\nThe war also has created the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. They include over 2.3 million who fled to neighboring countries.\nDevastating seasonal floods and cholera have compounded the Sudanese misery. At least 225 people have been killed and about 900 others were injured in the floods, the Health Ministry said. Critical infrastructure has been washed away, and more than 76,000 houses have been destroyed or damaged, it said.\nFamine was also confirmed in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, which is located about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from North Darfur\u2019s embattled capital of al-Fasher, according to global experts from the Famine Review Committee. About 25.6 million people \u2014 more than half of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 will face acute hunger this year, they warned.\nFighting, meanwhile, rages in al-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur that is still held by the military. The RSF has been attempting to retake it since the start of the year.\nLast week, the paramilitary force and its allied Arab militias launched a new attack on the city. The military said its forces, aided by rebel groups, managed to repel the attack and kill hundreds of RSF fighters, including two senior commanders.", "37277": "title: ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric: International humanitarian law was created to move beyond division, paving the way from polarization to peace \n content: Mr President,\nThe Security Council's success is measured by how you overcome global divisions; how you overcome the base definition of politics as one of \"you are either with us or against us.\u201d Bridging these differences requires leadership, as it is only leadership that can open the door for meaningful negotiations.\nWhat the International Committee of the Red Cross witnesses today is emboldened warring parties disregarding their legal obligations and, at times, using overly permissive interpretations of international humanitarian law to justify violations, destruction and impediments to humanitarian action.\nWhile we also know this is not systematically the case, unfortunately the collective inertia and acceptance of this abhorrent reality is setting a new threshold for placing humanity on a scale, disregarding the fact that all human lives have equal value.\nNormalized and seemingly tolerated misinterpretations of IHL \u2013 that happen under the watch of the international community \u2013 warp other conflicts far from the public sight.

Is it the destruction of villages and the killing of civilians?\nAnnihilation may bring military success, but not political or moral victory. If security systems take over every political decision, you forfeit the option to negotiate.\nWe commend all members of the Security Council for recalling systematically to the parties in conflict to comply with IHL and for recalling the letter of those obligations. But we must go beyond that, and make sure that the true meaning of international humanitarian law is adhered to.\nThis means taking all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm. It means not misrepresenting acceptable proportionality calculations. It means respecting the rules of war even if your enemy does not. It means accepting that neutral humanitarian actors can bring humanitarian assistance to areas your enemy controls. It also means ensuring that hospitals aren\u2019t hit, civilians can flee to safety, and food supplies are not cut off.\nInhumanity fuels violence; preserving humanity fosters de-escalation. States and militaries must fully integrate IHL into their defense strategies, not just for war, but to achieve victory that allows for long-term stability.\nWe must see the Council\u2019s rhetorical support for IHL put into action. You determine whether the Geneva Conventions are a tool for peace that saves lives.\n- When your ally targets civilians, pick up the phone and demand that they stop.\n- When your ally refuses ICRC visits to detainees or prisoners of war, pick up the phone and demand compliance.\n- When your ally bends the rules of war beyond recognition, use the means you have to stop them.\nIHL saves lives. It enabled the release of thousands of detainees in Yemen, the Chibok girls in Nigeria, and helped the ICRC escort orphans to safety in Khartoum. It\u2019s not the law that fails but the will to enforce it.\nThe chances of protecting the economic interest and security of your own people are best preserved if universally ratified agreements are respected. Because you never know when war may reach your own borders, and you find yourselves on the wrong side of the line.

While fighting was initially centered in the capital Khartoum, it quickly expanded to other areas across the country. The prolonged violence and insecurity have resulted in high numbers of civilian casualties, extensive damage to critical infrastructure and facilities, as well as large-scale displacement, with over 10 million people displaced inside and out of Sudan. As a result, Sudan currently faces the largest internal displacement crisis in the world and the most significant child displacement crisis, with more than three million children displaced inside and outside the country.\nThe impact of conflict has been disastrous for civilians. Nearly one in three people in Sudan is acutely food insecure, and the already-fragile health system is in tatters, with looming disease outbreaks, including an alarming cholera outbreak, as well as dengue fever, measles, and malaria. Sudan faces the worst levels of acute food insecurity in its history, with more than half of its population \u2013 25.6 million people \u2013 in acute hunger. That includes more than 8.5 million people facing emergency levels of hunger (IPC 4), as well as more than 755,000 people who are in catastrophic conditions (IPC 5) in Greater Darfur, South and North Kordofan, Blue Nile, Aj Jazirah, and Khartoum.\nDespite some of the most challenging and dangerous circumstances, local and international organizations continue to deliver humanitarian assistance, reaching nearly eight million people during the first half of this year. However, humanitarian access to reach all vulnerable people throughout the country remains severely hampered by ongoing hostilities, attacks on humanitarian workers, and operational and administrative constraints.\nThe Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan for 2024 requires $2.7 billion to provide life-saving assistance to 14.7 million people in need. As of mid-September, the plan is 48.7 per cent funded ($1.3 billion). Some sectors are covered much less than the average and face higher funding gaps: Nutrition (31 per cent); Emergency Shelter and Non-Food Items (26 per cent); Protection (22 per cent); WASH (23 per cent); Site Management (9.2 per cent); Education (nine per cent); Logistics (one per cent).\nIn anticipation of worsening food security conditions, humanitarian partners launched a Famine Prevention Plan (FPP) in April 2024. The plan targets 7.6 million people in acute need in priority areas in response to a famine early warning issued in March. While at least 5.6 million people (74 per cent of the target) received some form of assistance between May and July, the response falls short of meeting the acute needs. The Famine Prevention plan prioritizes a multisector approach, integrating food, nutrition, health and WASH response with other clusters. For more information please see: Sudan: Famine Prevention Snapshot, May - July 2024.\nSince the beginning of the crisis in May 2023, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF) have allocated $281.2 million ($101.3 million from CERF and $179.9 from the SHF) to ensure life-saving aid for 4.7 million and 4.6 million people, respectively, across Sudan. The allocations from the two funds ensure critical humanitarian support to the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict with much-needed health assistance, including sexual and reproductive services, shelter, water, food, and protection services.\nOn 25 September, in the margins of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly in New York, a High-level Event will be convened to strengthen support for the humanitarian response in Sudan and the region.

More than 10 million people - or over one in every five people - have fled their homes, including 8.1 million who have been displaced within Sudan and another 2.4 million who crossed the borders to neighbouring and other countries.\nIn recent days, at least 1,500 people were displaced from El Fasher, capital of North Darfur State following the escalation of hostilities in the town. \"Once again, I urge the parties to halt attacks on civilians, homes and essential facilities, such as hospitals, which are protected under the international humanitarian law,\" Ms. Nkweta-Salami said.\nThe situation in and around El Fasher is of particular concern, after the Famine Review Committee of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification confirmed famine conditions in the Zamzam displacement camp in August. Another 13 areas, including two other displacement camps in North Darfur, are likely experiencing similar conditions and need urgent access and assistance.\nMeanwhile, the outbreak of cholera and incidences of water or vector-borne diseases are aggravating the already dire situation that malnourished people, especially children and women, are facing. According to the Sudanese authorities, the number of cholera cases reported over the past two months has reached 13,300, including 415 related deaths.\nDespite insecurity, access and funding challenges, humanitarian partners provided more than 8 million people across Sudan with some form of humanitarian assistance this year. Over the past week, humanitarian organizations started distributing emergency food aid for about 180,000 people in Zamzam camp.\nMeanwhile, following the re-opening of the Adre border point between Chad and Sudan, UN aid agencies have moved 135 trucks with essential life-saving supplies for about 520,000 people via the crossing. \"The aid through Adre and food for people in Zamzam camp, where famine has been confirmed, are a testament to what the UN and humanitarian partners can accomplish,\" the Humanitarian Coordinator said. \"However, unrestricted access and additional funding are critical to reach more people in acute need.\"\nNine months into the year, the Sudan humanitarian appeal, seeking US$2.7 billion, is less than 50 per cent funded.

Sudanese media reported increased military movements and airstrikes in the districts of Khartoum and Omdurman, the heaviest in the capital area in months.\nMohamed Ibrahim, the health ministry\u2019s spokesperson in Khartoum, said in a statement that four civilians were killed and 14 others wounded in the latest fighting in the Karrari district of Omdurman, a city next to the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.\nA military spokesman confirmed the operation was underway, but declined to comment further. A military spokesman confirmed the operation was underway, but declined to comment further. The head of Sudan\u2019s military, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, addressed the U.N. General Assembly in New York, saying that \u201cwe\u2019ve done everything we could to put an end to this war and to steer our country from the destruction being waged\u201d by the militia.\nJeremy Laurence, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights office in Geneva, said in a statement to The Associated Press Thursday that at least 78 civilians were killed because of artillery shelling and airstrikes since the beginning of September in the Khartoum area.\n\u201cOur immediate concern is for the welfare of civilians, and the likelihood of further displacement and damage to civilian infrastructure,\" he said.\nFor months, some of the worst fighting has been in the city of El Fasher, the capital of the North Darfur state. RSF forces have laid siege to the city since May. On Thursday, U.N.

A total of 473 people have died from cholera since the country\u2019s rainy season began two months ago, health officials said.\nSudan\u2019s Federal Ministry of Health in a Wednesday update reported on Facebook 14,944 cholera cases across 10 states, with 386 new cases. It said that six people died on Tuesday alone in six states.\nThe majority of cases were reported in Kassala, where UNICEF is collaborating with the ministry and the World Health Organization to carry out a second round of the oral cholera vaccination campaign that kicked off last week.\nUNICEF delivered 404,000 doses of the vaccine to Sudan on Sep. 9. More vaccination campaigns are expected to be rolled out in other affected states.\nCholera was officially declared an outbreak on August 12 by the health ministry after a new wave of cases was reported starting July 22. The disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfalls and floods, especially in eastern Sudan which sheltered millions of people displaced by the conflict between the Sudanese military and the RSF.\nCholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and could be fatal if not immediately treated, according to WHO. It\u2019s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.\nUNICEF said in a statement last week that an estimated 3.4 million children under the age of 5 are at high risk of epidemic diseases.\nThe war in Sudan created environments prone to disease outbreaks, impacting millions of people already experiencing food insecurity and displacement.

Associate Professor McGlasson joined calls for critical investment to support local response groups working to help millions of people on the brink of starvation due to the country\u2019s ongoing civil war. CHL is a partner of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy (CDP), which is spearheading the fundraising call at the Clinton Global Initiative\u2019s annual meeting in New York on September 23 and 24. In total, 15 philanthropic and other organisations joined forces to form the Coalition for Mutual Aid in Sudan, making a Commitment to Action to support the lifesaving efforts of frontline responders in the country. Associate Professor McGlasson said CHL was proud to join the Coalition, which commits to channelling $2 million (USD) in direct and flexible emergency grants to vetted mutual aid groups by the end of the year. The Coalition also plans to generate at least $4.5 million (USD) more from peer philanthropies over the next two years to expand the reach and capacity of the humanitarian response in Sudan. \u2018CHL is now mobilising critical humanitarian leadership training and other support to mutual aid groups and local responders in Sudan as they lead efforts to help their communities survive this crisis,\u2019 Associate Professor McGlasson said. \u2018We hope the initiative galvanises further financial and in-kind support to tackle one of the biggest unfolding humanitarian catastrophes of our lifetimes.\u2019 Since civil war erupted in Sudan in April last year, the country has become home to the world\u2019s largest displacement and hunger crisis. More than 12 million people have been forced from their homes. Most of them are struggling to survive in Sudan with little or no food, clean water or medical services. More than 25 million people face acute hunger and experts believe mass starvation is both inevitable and imminent. Patricia McIlreavy, CEO of the CDP, said the crisis required massive global investment and \u2018an all-hands-on-deck\u2019 response. \u2018Traditionally, a crisis of the scale unfolding in Sudan would have the international aid system supporting the national response. However, due to access impediments, Sudanese community groups remain the primary frontline responders and currently the most effective means of aiding millions on the brink of starvation. \u2018We call on philanthropy and government donors to join us in investing in mutual aid in Sudan, the most viable mechanism to reach the most affected communities there, now and for the foreseeable future.\u2019 CHL is formed through a partnership between Deakin University and Save the Children Australia.

The innovative initiative aims to develop a robust snake identification database using a collection of over 380,000 snake images.\nThis software, crafted to assist medical staff in real-time, focuses on distinguishing between venomous and harmless snake species, recommending appropriate actions to treat patients.\nSnakebite envenoming is a significant health challenge globally, particularly affecting remote and underserved communities. Between January and the end of July 2024, more than 300 patients had been treated in MSF medical facilities across South Sudan.\n\u201cI remember a time when we used photo albums to identify snakes in MSF hospitals. Medical staff would flip through pictures to figure out which snake had bitten a patient,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Alcoba, MSF Medical Advisor for Snakebite and Neglected Tropical Diseases at MSF. \u201cI witnessed this firsthand in South Sudan and other countries while working on snakebite envenoming and other neglected tropical diseases.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cToday, experts have created a snake identification database with 380,000 photos of snakes from different countries, using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.\u201d\nAccording to Dr. Alcoba, this innovative approach is now being piloted around two MSF hospitals in Twic and Abyei towns in South Sudan.\nTogether with the University of Geneva\u2019s One Health Unit and support from MSF teams on the ground in South Sudan, as well as the medical and innovation departments at MSF in Switzerland, MSF is improving its database.\n\u201cWe are developing software that uses AI to help identify snake species in the field, distinguishing between venomous and harmless snakes. This software can recommend the best action for a person bitten by a snake before they reach a hospital,\u201d Dr. Alcoba. \u201cWe are currently working on collecting quality photographs to feed into this software. South Sudan has one of the lowest numbers of snake ecological studies but also experiences high rates of snakebite admissions in MSF hospitals, especially from May to October.\u201d\nHe explained that for the AI to identify a particular snake, they need a photo of it, either while it is still alive (while taking all necessary precautions) or, when the snake is dead, (still taking great care since it could still bite).\n\u201cIf someone has been bitten, the bite victim or someone nearby can try to take a photo of the snake after the bite occurs, but this must be done with extreme caution. If it was not possible to take a photo at the time of the bite, our staff can go back to the bite site and try to take a photo of the snake, again with great care,\u201d he stated. \u201cOnce we have a photo, it goes into the AI software, which compares it with thousands of images to identify the snake or add it as a new entry with GPS coordinates.\u201d\nAccording to the medic, early results are promising; the AI sometimes identifies snakes even better than experts! For instance, it can differentiate between venomous snakes like the Egyptian Cobra or Black Mamba and harmless ones like the African House Snake.\n\u201cWith better-quality photos, funding, and more research, this snake-AI app could provide real-time help for patients, from snake identification to choosing the right antivenom,\u201d he said. \u201cMore research is still needed. Often, patients receive the wrong treatment because the snake isn\u2019t correctly identified, or valuable antivenom is wasted on bites from non-venomous snakes, which can also cause serious side effects. Antivenom is rare and extremely expensive, costing a patient anywhere from a month to a year\u2019s salary.\u201d\nSnakebite envenoming is a global health concern, associated with population displacement and climate shocks such as floods. Every year, five million people are bitten by snakes; of those, two million suffer severe effects, and between 81,000 and 138,000 die as a result of snakebite envenoming, according to WHO data.\nSnake venom can cause three major syndromes: skin swelling, muscle destruction, and fatal hemorrhages or respiratory paralysis. Snakebite envenoming is classified as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD), mainly affecting people in remote, rural, flooded, or conflict areas in low-and middle-income countries. Consequently, it is not a lucrative market for big pharmaceutical companies or policymakers, despite the millions affected. Indeed, research on effective, \u201cpolyvalent,\u201d less complex, safer, and affordable antivenoms has not been prioritized.", "43000": "title: UN Humanitarian coordinator calls on world leaders \u201cto step up to end the devastating conflict in Sudan\u201d \n content: UN Humanitarian coordinator calls on world leaders \u201cto step up to end the devastating conflict in Sudan\u201d\nAs world leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, has urged Member States and the international community to focus on the plight of millions of people in Sudan who have endured more than 17 months of brutal conflict, which has resulted in the world\u2019s fastest-growing civilian displacement and humanitarian crisis.\nWorld leaders are gathering in New York today (Tuesday, 24 September), to Saturday, 28 September, and on Monday, 30 September 2024 to engage in the annual high-level General Debate of the UN General Assembly under the theme, \u201cLeaving no one behind: acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations\u201d.

From Gaza to Ukraine to Sudan and beyond \u2014 wars grind on, suffering grows, hunger deepens, lives are upended, and the legitimacy and effectiveness of the United Nations, and this Council, are undermined.\nLeadership for peace requires action in at least two key areas.\nFirst \u2014 leadership for peace means all Member States living up to their commitments in the UN Charter, in international law and in recent agreements such as the Pact for the Future.\nAmong other things, the Pact calls for strengthening tools and frameworks to prevent conflict, sustain peace and advance sustainable development, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women.\nIt calls for updating our tools for peace operations to allow for more agile, tailored responses to existing, emerging and future challenges.\nIt reinforces the commitment to all human rights \u2014 civil, political, economic, social and cultural.\nIt includes initiatives around disarmament, peacebuilding, and managing threats posed by lethal autonomous weapons and artificial intelligence and in new domains, including outer space and cyberspace.\nIt calls for measures to quickly address complex global shocks. And it contains a new push to reform key institutions of global governance, including the global financial architecture and this very Council.\nThe Pact is a down-payment on these reforms. But we will need strong political will to implement them and rebuild the legitimacy and effectiveness of this Council. Which brings me to my second point about leadership for peace.\nLeadership for peace means ensuring that the UN Security Council acts in a meaningful way to ease global tensions and help address the conflicts that are inflicting so much suffering around the world.\nGeopolitical divisions continue to block effective solutions. A united Council can make a tremendous difference for peace. A divided Council cannot. It is imperative that Council Members spare no effort to work together to find common ground. And it has proven capable of doing so in some key areas.\nFrom currently overseeing 11 peacekeeping operations on three continents, involving nearly 70,000 uniformed peacekeeping personnel\u2026\nTo resolutions that help keep vital humanitarian aid flowing to the world\u2019s hotspots\u2026\nTo the landmark resolution 2719 (2023), which provides for African-Union led peace support operations authorized by the Council to have access to UN assessed contributions\u2026\nTo the groundbreaking resolutions that recognized the clear implications of peace and security challenges on the lives of women and youth\u2026\nTo this Council\u2019s growing ties to regional and subregional organizations to foster consensus and peace. These examples \u2014 and more \u2014 prove that forging peace is possible.\nWhen we consider the most difficult and intractable conflicts on this Council\u2019s agenda, peace can seem an impossible dream.\nBut I strongly believe that peace is possible if we stick to principles. Peace in Ukraine is possible. By following the UN Charter and abiding by international law.\nPeace in Gaza is possible. By sparing no effort for an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, and the beginning of an irreversible process towards a two-State solution.\nPeace in Sudan is possible. By sending a clear message to the warring parties that all Members of this Council \u2014 including the five permanent Members \u2014 will not tolerate the horrific violence and desperate humanitarian crisis being unleashed on innocent civilians.\nThe situations on this Council\u2019s agenda are complex and do not have quick fixes. But the scale of the challenge should not deter us. Our only hope for progress on peace is active collaboration and unity among Council Members.\nToday, I call on all Members to live up to this great responsibility, and to the promise of the UN Charter. Contribute to this Council\u2019s success \u2014 not its diminishment. Let\u2019s ensure that this Council serves as an effective and representative forum for peace \u2014 today and in the years to come.\nFor information media.

Sudan leaders 'deliberately' thwarted polls -UN \n content: You are here: Home | Governance | National News | News | Unelected S. Sudan leaders \u2018deliberately\u2019 thwarted polls -UN\nThe United Nations Human Rights Commission has accused what it describes as South Sudan unelected leaders of having deliberately thwarted efforts to democratize the country by extending the transitional period.\nThe rights body is reacting to the just extended transitional period for another two years.\nThe Commission said it noted that despite the last two-year extension of the Revitalized Agreement in August 2022, most critical tasks remain unimplemented, including the comprehensive unification of armed forces and their deployment, development of a permanent constitution, establishment of rule of law and transitional justice mechanisms, and credible electoral arrangements.\nIt attributes this to the failure by the country\u2019s transitional political leaders to what it said conscientiously implement the revitalized peace agreement, whose key provisions have the potential to consolidate peace, uphold human rights protections, and transform the country, the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan said on Wednesday.\nThe delays and unwillingness to compromise according to the commission, reflect the preoccupations of the elite\u2019s most concerned with remaining in power, and enriching themselves from the country\u2019s vast oil and other wealth.\nThe commission also said the challenges to a peaceful transition to democracy are not insurmountable if one implements t the Revitalized Agreement as it was envisaged.\nCited in the statement, Yasmin Sooka, Chair of the UN Human Rights Commission said: \u201cSince independence in 2011, South Sudan\u2019s unelected leaders have continued to entrench impunity for systematic and gross human rights violations, fuel insecurity, and deliberately thwart efforts to democratize the country.\u201d\n\u201cIn the six years since the Revitalized Agreement was adopted, the main political parties have had sufficient time to implement its key provisions. A flagrant disregard for the plight of their own citizens is a testament to unaccountable leaders not having the political will to respect and protect human rights,\u201d said Commissioner Sooka.\nThe Commission observed that the delay by South Sudanese leadership to pursue peace has resulted in a dire humanitarian crisis, characterized by extreme hunger and food insecurity, and the displacement of more than four million South Sudanese both in the country and the region.\nThe Commission noted that \u201cdespite the last two-year extension of the Revitalized Agreement in August 2022, most critical tasks remain unimplemented, including the comprehensive unification of armed forces and their deployment, development of a permanent constitution, establishment of rule of law and transitional justice mechanisms, and credible electoral arrangements.\u201d\nIt stated that \u201d these are the minimum requirements for good governance, to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights to prevent further violations, as well as being the pathway for South Sudan\u2019s durable recovery from devastating conflict.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Commissioner Barney Afako said that the political leaders must finally and urgently invest in delivering tangible democratic, protection and human rights outcomes.\u201d\nHe warns that in the face of multiple challenges South Sudan faces, it should not be business as usual.\n\u201cSouth Sudan faces a maelstrom of interlinked crises. Damage to one of the oil export pipelines, linked to war in Sudan, has significantly reduced national revenue at a time when South Sudan hosts hundreds of thousands of newly displaced persons, including Sudanese refugees.\u201d\nThe rights commission stressed that it imperative that South Sudanese should be enabled to finally choose their leaders.\n\u201cSouth Sudanese desperately need their leaders to become responsive to their rights, needs, and aspirations, otherwise the country\u2019s transition is in peril, with potential for catastrophic consequences.\u201d\nThe members of the Commission urged that the citizens participate in making a permanent constitution and dealing with accountability for the past, which they say \u201care preconditions for building a democratic and stable society.\u201d\nThey called on the Government to ensure an inclusive and participatory process in regard to the peace processes, including through the ongoing Tumaini Initiative.\nThe official require that the processes that remain are transparent, and provide opportunities for public participation in all their aspects, guaranteeing the safety and security of all.\nMeanwhile, they urged the African Union, IGAD and the international community to continue their support to South Sudan and to hold the country\u2019s leadership to account for the implementation of the outstanding tasks linked to the transition.\nPublished 25 mins ago\nPublished 40 mins ago\nPublished 55 mins ago\nPublished 4 hours ago\nPublished 5 hours ago\nPublished 5 hours ago\nSupport Eye Radio, the first independent radio broadcaster of news, information & entertainment in South Sudan.\nMake a monthly or a one off contribution.\nCopyright 2024.

An estimated 88 per cent of the generous pledges made in Paris have now been fulfilled.\nHowever, huge gaps remain, and additional funding is urgently needed, particularly to address rapidly deteriorating food insecurity.\nI am pleased to announce today a US$25 million allocation from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund to tackle the spread of famine and acute food insecurity in Sudan. This will complement an ongoing allocation at country level from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund.\nI hope this will encourage our donor partners to step up with additional flexible funding for Sudan, including through these crucial pooled funds, so we can continue to scale up the urgent response.\nAnd finally, the nightmare that this conflict has imposed on the lives of millions must come to an end.\nNo stone must be left unturned in the pursuit of a real, inclusive and lasting peace in Sudan.\nThank you very much.\nDisclaimer\n- UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n- To

horrific violations continue unabated:\nCivilians killed in their hundreds in attacks on residential areas.\nSexual violence used as a tactic of war, particularly against women and girls.\nEthnically motivated attacks, and testimonies of summary execution, rape and forced displacement in West Darfur.\nAnd now, as the rainy season and its devastating floods subside, we have seen a rapid escalation of the fighting in El Fasher in North Darfur, causing further death and destruction, with clashes also continuing to directly impact civilians in several other areas.\nThe humanitarian situation in Sudan is beyond appalling.\nThe war has triggered what is now among the world\u2019s largest displacement crises.\nMore than half the population of Sudan \u2013 25.6 million people \u2013 is acutely food insecure.\nLast month, famine was confirmed in Zamzam displacement camp, near El Fasher, with similar conditions likely in nearby sites, and many other areas at immediate risk.\nAlmost 5 million children under the age of 5 and pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are already acutely malnourished.\nAnd basic services \u2013 including healthcare, schools, water and sanitation systems and life-saving telecommunications networks \u2013 have largely broken down.\nThis dire situation is compounded by severe constraints on humanitarian access:\nA volatile security situation that complicates the movement of supplies and endangers humanitarian personnel.\nA wide range of bureaucratic and administrative restrictions that can further delay aid deliveries and the movement of humanitarian personnel.\nFrequent denials of access to key areas.\nAnd, over recent months, heavy rains that have damaged roads, bridges and a crucial dam, and enabled the rapid spread of cholera and other diseases.\nDespite the courageous efforts of local and international humanitarian organizations, we simply cannot deliver adequate levels of assistance.\nLet us not be here again, in one year\u2019s time, lamenting another 12 months of death, destruction and unbearable suffering.\nToday, let us commit to taking urgent, concrete steps to protect and support civilians in Sudan.\nFirst, we urge Member States to use all their leverage to bring the horrific violations of international humanitarian law and the abuses of human rights law to an end.\nSecond, we need a concerted diplomatic push for a step change in humanitarian access.\nFor the safe, streamlined and swift delivery of aid through all possible routes \u2013 both cross-border and cross-line.\nAnd for the facilitation of the day-to-day life-saving work of humanitarian organizations on the ground.\nWe welcome the recent announcement by the President of the Sovereign Council of Sudan to reopen the crucial Adre crossing from Chad.\nWe urge Member States to support efforts to scale up the volume of assistance through the crossing and to extend this lifeline beyond the initial three-month period, without the imposition of new processes that may further delay operations.\nAnd we need to see very significant improvements in our ability to move supplies and personnel along routes crossing the conflict lines.\nWe welcome the vital efforts of the Aligned for Advancing Lifesaving and Peace in Sudan Group on access.\nThird, we need renewed financial commitments from the donor community.\nWe greatly appreciate the support we have received to date, including the disbursed pledges from the Paris Conference. An estimated 88 per cent of the generous pledges made in Paris have now been fulfilled.\nHowever, huge gaps remain, and additional funding is urgently needed, particularly to address rapidly deteriorating food insecurity.\nI am pleased to announce today a US$25 million allocation from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund to tackle the spread of famine and acute food insecurity in Sudan. This will complement an ongoing allocation at country level from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund.\nI hope this will encourage our donor partners to step up with additional flexible funding for Sudan, including through these crucial pooled funds, so we can continue to scale up the urgent response.\nAnd finally, the nightmare that this conflict has imposed on the lives of millions must come to an end.\nNo stone must be left unturned in the pursuit of a real, inclusive and lasting peace in Sudan.\nThank you very much.", "52448": "title: Sudan: Pregnant Women and Children Dying in Shocking Numbers in South Darfur \n content: One of the worst maternal and child health emergencies in the world is unfolding in South Darfur, Sudan, according to a report released by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF).

Humanitarian organizations call for urgent action from World Leaders as the people of Sudan face unprecedented starvation and violence [EN/AR] - Sudan | ReliefWeb \n content: Nairobi, Sept 23, 2024 \u2013 Ahead of the Ministerial Meeting on Sudan at this year\u2019s UN General Assembly (UNGA), members of the Sudan NGO Forum call on the international community to increase pressure on conflict parties to facilitate immediate humanitarian access through all possible cross border and cross-line routes; establish mechanisms to protect civilians and essential infrastructure from indiscriminate attacks; and increase funding and initiatives to support communities\u2019 responding at scale to this crisis.\nSudan is experiencing a man-made starvation crisis of historic proportions, largely driven by the actions and decisions of the conflict parties, in violation of international humanitarian law (IHL).\nAs of August 2024, over 25 million people across Sudan are facing severe acute food insecurity, and at least 755,000 people facing catastrophic (IPC Phase 5) levels of hunger could die in the coming months without urgent and decisive action from the international community. Over 10 million people have fled their homes since the conflict broke out in April 2023, making Sudan the world\u2019s largest internal displacement crisis, affecting more than 5 million children, and over 2 million people, who have crossed into neighboring countries.\nWhile famine has been confirmed in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, the Famine Review Committee affirm that thousands more people are likely experiencing similar conditions in 13 other areas at risk of famine, including Darfur, Kordofan, Al Jazirah and Khartoum. Humanitarian organizations' experience already shows that children are dying every single day due to malnutrition, with some health facilities reporting five daily deaths.\nThe crisis is primarily the result of systematic and indiscriminate attacks by all conflict parties on civilians, particularly local responders delivering assistance in the hardest to reach areas. Hospitals, schools, markets, telecommunications, water and irrigation systems and other infrastructure essential to people's survival have also been targeted, as documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan.\nIn El Fasher, the largest city in the Darfur region, civilians have been living under siege since May 2024, with the UN Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide warning that indicators of genocide could exist. This past week has seen a further escalation of hostilities, including shelling and aerial bombardment, putting the lives of over 1.5 million civilians at risk.\nThe conflict's impact is exacerbated by ongoing severe restrictions on civilian access to life-saving supplies such as food, cash, medicine, water and fuel. Despite commitments to the contrary by parties to the conflict, restrictions on civilian movement and limitations on the movement of essential humanitarian supplies and personnel across borders and lines of conflict, are preventing humanitarian aid from being delivered at scale. Between August and September 2024, nearly 7 million people could not access humanitarian assistance due to access constraints, including arbitrary denials. Many communities in the states of South Kordofan,\nKhartoum, Al-Jazirah, Central Darfur and Blue Nile are being completely cut off from aid.\nAs delegates meet at UNGA this week, Member States should urgently act on the findings of the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Sudan and take tangible steps to protect civilians from the impacts of the conflict, safeguard access to principled humanitarian assistance, at a scale which meets their urgent needs and ensure accountability for violations of IHL. NGOs urge UN Member States engaging on Sudan at UNGA to:\nSecure unhindered and unimpeded humanitarian access:\n\u2022 Apply increased diplomatic pressure on conflict parties\u2014and their backers\u2014to: lift all constraints to aid delivery; facilitate the critical work of humanitarian organizations, including local organizations and mutual aid groups; increase all feasible cross-border and cross-line entry points; and publicly condemn denials of humanitarian access by all parties.\n\u2022 Pressure the conflict parties to cease the deliberate targeting of aid workers, including local organizations and other community-based mutual aid groups.\nEnsure the protection of civilians:\n\u2022 Spotlight violations against civilians, including grave violations against women and children, committed by the warring parties as well as their backers. Call on conflict parties to immediately cease all actions that endanger civilians and civilian objects and infrastructure, especially those essential to food production and distribution.\n\u2022 In response to the UNSG\u2019s anticipated report to the UN Security Council on options to protect civilians, take immediate steps to resource and operationalize key recommendations.\n\u2022 Mandate and resource a dedicated neutral and independent body to champion, lead, and coordinate Protection of Civilians (PoC) efforts, with a primary focus on supporting local level PoC initiatives.\n\u2022 Recognize, endorse and support localized conflict Early Warning Systems and conflict monitoring to facilitate conflict mediation and de-escalation.\nStrengthen diplomacy on conflict-induced hunger:\n\u2022 The UN Security Council, UN leadership and member states should engage in proactive diplomacy to highlight and condemn the use of hunger as a weapon of war in Sudan, as per Resolution 2417 and the G7 Famine Prevention Compact\n\u2022 Considering escalating food insecurity, increase the frequency of briefings in the UNSC on conflict-induced hunger in Sudan and mandate the monitoring of the risk of the use of starvation as a tactic of war. This could be supported by a cross-sector reporting mechanism documenting instances of IHL violations leading to hunger, including denials of humanitarian assistance.\nIncrease flexible funding for all humanitarian action in Sudan:\n\u2022 Immediately and significantly increase funding to the Sudan humanitarian response to scale up multisectoral humanitarian assistance; including flexible and direct funding to local actors, including women and youth led organizations, who are best placed to help communities in dire need.\nThe Sudan NGO Forum is the coordination and representation body for the international nongovernmental organization (INGO) community in Sudan. The Forum is currently comprised of 70 members and observer members providing humanitarian and development assistance and peacebuilding interventions across all 18 states of Sudan.\nFor media enquiries\nIn English - Fashion Mawere: darfur@sudaningoforum.org In Arabic - Obada Alabdallah: access@sudaningoforum.org", "56030": "title: How MSF provides mental health care for migrants and asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border \n content: Clinical social worker Athena Viscusi explains how MSF is responding to the needs of people crossing the border into Arizona and the stories they share about their journeys to the US.\nFor many people traveling through the Americas in search of safety, crossing the southern border into the United States marks the end of a dangerous and uncertain journey\u2014but the start of another that brings its own challenges.\nIn August, Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) resumed collaboration with local humanitarian organizations in Arizona that assist people crossing the southern US border from Mexico, delivering essentials like hygiene products, food, water, and psychological first aid.\nMany migrants describe a flood of emotions and relief for having arrived, but also sadness and anger over the difficulties they have experienced and homesickness for what and who they left behind.\nBelow, Athena Viscusi, a clinical social worker in MSF\u2019s psychosocial care unit working in Arizona, answers questions about our work with people crossing the border, their needs, and what they tell her about their journeys to the United States.\nWhat are some of the needs that asylum seekers have right after they cross the border into the US?\nWe talk about post-traumatic stress in people on the move. But for those who are just crossing the border, it\u2019s not post-traumatic. They are still in a kind of traumatic reaction, which is a physical and mental state. And they should be. They are hyper alert, and ready to run at any moment after what many of them have gone through.\nAt this point, it's important to restore that sense of control and agency. They've been completely disempowered and at the mercy of other people. Some have been brutalized repeatedly. And if not themselves, they have witnessed other people being brutalized. Some have been under a constant threat of violence for days, weeks, or months.\nThere is also physical exhaustion. Some of them have been sleeping outside or not sleeping at all, traveling on the floor of a car, or just walking for miles. They really have such overwhelming physical needs that need to be fulfilled: food, water, and rest.\nHow can aid organizations help meet these needs?\nThe most relevant psychosocial intervention for most arrivals is psychological first aid\u2014that includes meeting their immediate physical needs for food and rest, listening to them, and connecting them with necessary information. The presence of a trained mental health professional allows more targeted interventions and helps people in distress get relief and develop skills.\nSome are from extremely deprived circumstances, have little education or possessions, or are from marginalized or oppressed groups in their countries of origin. Often their family units have been disrupted and they may have lost travel companions along the way.\nSome of them have been sleeping outside or not sleeping at all, traveling on the floor of a car, or just walking for miles. They really have such overwhelming physical needs that need to be fulfilled: food, water, and rest.\nThe length of stay in volunteer-run makeshift camps, size of the group, languages spoken, and the severity of needs affect the quantity and quality of psychosocial services that can be provided.\nWhat material items provide the greatest immediate comfort to those arriving?\nOften, there is no cell phone connection along the border wall and for many stretches of desert in the Mexico and US sides of the border, so provision of internet is a key psychosocial intervention; it allows migrants to contact their families.\nFor volunteers who are helping migrants and asylum seekers on the US side, an internet connection facilitates access to websites and phone calls to get information to reassure and orient them\u2014for example, how to locate someone in detention, where to find medical services in the city of destination, educational materials in various languages, and of course, translation apps.\nProviding simple recreational activities for children, such as bubbles, balloons, and small toys, is also a useful psychosocial approach. Trained mental health professionals can also address parents\u2019 concerns about their children and provide information about the immigration process ahead.\nWhat are some of the stories you\u2019ve heard from migrants and asylum seekers? How were you able to help?\nA young man from Sudan had been wounded during the shelling of his home outside Khartoum, during which his two brothers died in front of his eyes. He still carried shrapnel embedded in his collarbone. He was tearful and spoke of constantly having the image of his dead brothers in his head. This story had a hopeful ending: one of the volunteers was able to connect him with a relative who is a surgeon in nearby Phoenix, who agreed to operate on him pro bono.\nWe spoke with a Chinese woman who had been forcibly implanted with an intrauterine device (IUD) due to China\u2019s \u201cone child policy\u201d and religious discrimination. She was crying hysterically, and her partner specifically requested psychological help for her.\nA Honduran woman fleeing domestic violence with her six-year-old son had visible scars from what looked like machete cuts. We helped her calm down, understand the asylum process, and refocus on the needs of her son.\nAn unaccompanied minor from Guinea was separated from the group of unrelated adults he had traveled with. He received an explanation of the system for unaccompanied minors and was prepared psychologically for what was ahead. He had been robbed of all his belongings in Mexico and did not have any family or friends to contact in the US.\nWhat mental health challenges do volunteers experience at the border?\nBurnout is a significant factor for volunteers doing this hard and sometimes unrewarding work. Volunteers witness tremendous suffering and injustice. They travel long distances over terrible roads to provide assistance in very remote areas, work long hours in the hot sun with no shade, and go long periods without any means of communication. They receive calls about migrants lost in the desert and find wounded people and dead bodies, while lacking resources such as reliable cars or funds for food and other supplies to meet the needs of migrants. Some have been doing this work since the 1980s.\nThe most significant factor contributing to volunteer resilience is the social support that comes from a community of like-minded people. Some are members of religious communities and are even members of the clergy. Maintaining social bonds is a key psychological need for both volunteers and migrants.\nOur work in Arizona\nSince early 2024, MSF has worked alongside volunteers from Humane Borders, Samaritans, No More Deaths, and other Arizona-based groups helping asylum seekers and migrants crossing the US-Mexico border in the Sonora desert. Initially, a small team evaluated medical needs in the region and suggested ways to develop capacity and increase services and collaboration. In August 2024, MSF resumed its support to local groups. MSF will consider additional support based on the needs that might arise from a surge in numbers of people crossing the border.", "61043": "title: Sudan, conflict \n content: Page 1 of 4\n\nSudan, conflict\n\nETC Situation Report #21 Reporting period: 01/09/2024 to 30/09/2024\n\nThe Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) was activated on 25 May 2023 to support the humanitarian response following the outbreak of conflict on 15 April 2023. The ETC is led by WFP in Sudan. ETC Situation Reports (SitReps) are produced monthly.\n\nHighlights\n\nThe one Gigabit (1GB) \u2015 internet download speed\u2015dedicated undersea cable activated on 21 August is operational and providing reliable internet services in Port Sudan. The cluster is now planning to expand the connectivity services to Kassala, El Gadaref, Kosti, and Damazine.\n\nThe ETC is conducting a pilot project across five locations in Port Sudan to leverage the undersea cable. The pilot is scheduled to run for one month.\n\nThe ETC's operational reach has been significantly enhanced with government approval for internal flights to Dongola and Kassala, in addition to Port Sudan.\n\nSituation overview\n\nProgramming VHF radios for UN women - Location WFP office Port Sudan\n\nThe security situation in Sudan remains highly volatile with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) dominating Darfur and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) controlling other regions. The situation in Darfur is particularly concerning due to RSF taking control of the area. In addition, Sudan continues to face infrastructural challenges with telecommunications services severely impacted by internet blackouts and power outages.\n\nIn September, security incidents were minimal in Port Sudan, and the stability of the telecommunications infrastructure remained intact. However, regions such as Damazine and areas along the northern border continue to face security threats and humanitarian challenges.\n\nNational telecommunications infrastructure\n\nMuch of Sudan is affected by several internet blackouts which began on 07 February 2024. National telecommunications services have been severely disrupted across the country and telecommunications infrastructure remains compromised. Partial restoration of services by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)\u2015Zain and Sudani\u2015has provided limited connectivity, however, these are frequently interrupted due to power cuts and infrastructure damage. Consequently, Sudan relies heavily on satellite communication services as a viable option for data connectivity.\n\nIn efforts to improve resilience against connectivity issues, discussions with Sudan\u2019s National Telecommunication Corporation (NTC) have led to strategies for importing essential equipment such as radios and network infrastructure in small batches.\n\nEmergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)\n\nwww.ETCluster.org\n---\nPage 2 of 4\n\nSee the Sudan ICT Profile for more information on national telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nETC Activities Coordination\n\nThe ETC continued its close coordination with local and international actors to ensure the effective deployment and operational readiness of telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nPlans to establish an operational hub near Khartoum have been suspended due to the worsening security situation, the relocation plans are under review by OCHA and UNDSS.\n\nIn September, the ETC is coordinating with the Dubai team to import procured equipment due to stock shortages. Delays in receiving import authorization from the NTC have been a challenge, but the ETC aims to complete the first shipment this month, covering three locations.\n\nA planned mission to Darfur in early September was postponed due to heavy rainfall and the discovery of unexploded ordnance (UXOs). The new mission date is tentatively scheduled for mid-September, pending security assessments.\n\nHumanitarian partners can request information, technical advice, and access to services to the ETC through the Sudan.ETC@wfp.org email address. A ticketing system has been established to manage the high volume of requests being received.\n\nData connectivity\n\nETC internet connectivity services are provided in five common operational areas\u2014Port Sudan (41 sites), Kassala (17 sites), Kosti (one site using the WFP office premises), Damazine (one site using the WFP office premises), and El Gedaref (one site).\n\nThe activation of the undersea cable in Port Sudan marks a major step forward in improving data connectivity, providing services to multiple humanitarian agencies. The ETC will begin allocating the bandwidth to various locations in collaboration with Sudatel. The first location to receive the allocation will be Kassala, followed by El Gedaref. The team will also focus on the northern region, specifically Atbara and Dongola.\n\nThe advanced data connectivity kits remain operational in RSF-controlled regions such as Darfur. However, in SAF-controlled areas, strict regulations have restricted the deployment of these services, and further negotiations are required.\n\nIn September, the ETC has initiated a one-month pilot project to optimize data connectivity in five key offices: Nergis, Jebel Alsit, UNDSS, WFP, and UNITAMS.\n\nThe ETC continues to use advanced connectivity kits, fibre, and VSAT networks to provide data connectivity across Sudan. Security communications\n\nThe four Security Operations Centres (SOCs) in Port Sudan, Kassala, El Gedaref, and Damazine are fully operational. The Port Sudan SOC operates 24/7, and there are plans to extend 24/7 operations to the other SOCs. Currently, all SOCs are connected to a remote SOC (RSOC) in Nairobi, but plans are in place to relocate the RSOC to Port Sudan to be closer to the operational needs.\n\nEmergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)\n\nwww.ETCluster.org\n---\nPage 3 of 4\n\nFollowing discussions with UNDSS in August to finalize the deployment of radio operators and explore how ETC can support the UNDSS SOCs, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been drafted to formalize the transfer of radio operators\u2019 salaries to the ETC budget. This will ensure the continued support of SOCs across key areas.\n\nDuring the month, the ETC programmed 20 VHF handheld radios for UN Women to boost the safety of humanitarian responders by ensuring reliable and secure communication. Services for communities\n\nThe current plan is to expand the ETC operations, particularly in the Darfur regions, where a significant proportion of the population is in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Plans to roll out services for communities in Port Sudan remain delayed due to equipment shortages.\n\nA mission to Zalingei was planned for 2 September, but it was tentatively rescheduled to 16 September. However, due to ongoing skirmishes across Khartoum and other parts of the country, the mission has been postponed until further notice.\n\nThe ETC has purchased US$3 million worth of networking equipment which is currently being prepositioned in Nairobi for deployment to Sudan. A training workshop consisting of five sessions will be conducted in Dubai in October, targeting WFP staff, UN agencies, and NGOs operating in Sudan and neighbouring countries. The primary purpose of the training is to build the capacity of staff to effectively use and implement the new equipment.\n\nUNHAS has secured government approval to operate internal flights beyond Port Sudan, now extending to Dongola and Kassala. This is a significant development for ETC, as it enhances accessibility for humanitarian agencies to more locations, enabling improved staffing and support for critical operations across the country.\n\nFunding\n\nIn 2024, the ETC requires US$6.3 million to continue its provision and expansion of shared ICT services across Sudan in support of humanitarian operations.\n\nSo far in 2024, only the UK Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has allocated GBP 240,385. This contribution means that the ETC is 5% funded out of the required US$6.3 million. Therefore, an additional US$6 million is still required to meet the funding objectives for 2024. The Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) grant and the US Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) are fully consumed.\n\nThe team is currently using the funds carried over from 2023 mainly IRA funds. However, concerns were raised as these funds are not expected to last until the end of the year. The ETC is calling for supplementary funds to cover this shortfall.\n\nChallenges\n\nSecurity concerns, restricted travel, and logistical constraints continue to create operational challenges.\n\nIn addition, the ETC faces an ongoing challenge in moving equipment between states. The government has introduced a new requirement whereby prior approval must be obtained before moving any Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) www.ETCluster.org\n---\nPage 4 of 4\n\nequipment from one location to another within the country, which is adding complexity to the ETC\u2019s operations. Telecommunications infrastructure, particularly in SAF-controlled regions, faces operational restrictions, limiting the deployment of critical services. Recent flooding and unexploded ordnance in Darfur have further delayed humanitarian operations.\n\nDashboard The latest ETC Dashboard for the Sudan operation is available here.\n\nMeetings A Global ETC Partners Teleconference took place on 05 September.

N., 2024\n---\nI.\n\nContext Setting\n\nIn mid-April 2023, Sudan descended into a major conflict as clashes between the Sudan Armed country. The conflict has led to over 12,000 deaths, extensive damage to infrastructure, and now faces the world\u2019s largest internal and child displacement crisis.2 This includes 2.3 million seeking refuge in neighboring countries and 10.5 million internally displaced, over half of whom Response Plan, 15% of Sudan's population in need (24.8 million people) and targeted (14.7 million people) are persons with disabilities (PWDs) and 5% of the two above mentioned groups exploitation, violence, and abuse.\n\nThe conflict has severely impacted access to basic services, leading to interruptions in water, healthcare, banking, electricity, and telecommunications, compounded by frequent looting5. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in late 2023 showed escalating food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly in conflict zones.6 An IPC alert in March 2024 emphasized the worsening situation and the looming threat of famine in highly vulnerable regions with worsening projections of looming famine demonstrated in the new IPC report.7 With ongoing conflict, heightened food insecurity and water scarcity, the protection needs of communities will increase, including GBV and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA). Women, girls, men, and boys, in all their diversity, will have distinct needs in assistance and face different barriers to assistance that must be accounted for in emergency programming. In response, the Sudan Famine Prevention Operational Plan was launched, coordinating efforts across Food Security and Livelihoods, Nutrition, Health, WASH, Education, Shelter and NFI clusters, with a focus on protection, gender equality, disability inclusion, and cross-cutting themes such as accountability to affected communities and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA).8\n\nThis Guidance was developed under the auspices of the Sudan PSEA Network.

This document is an asset to the Famine Prevention Plan as it provides actionable recommendations for Clusters and Working Groups under the Famine Prevention Plan. This is intended to be a living guidance document, fine-tuned with granular information from frontline Implementing / programme Partners, literature review and complemented by operational adjustment. These agreed minimum standards are also expected to inform allocations from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF).\n\nAn integrated risk analysis for cross-cutting issues in the Famine Prevention Plan is essential for several reasons:\n\n1. 2.\n\n3. 4.\n\nComprehensive Understanding: It provides a thorough grasp of the various factors contributing to food insecurity and vulnerability. Interconnectedness of Risks: It identifies and addresses intersectional risks by examining the interconnected nature of cross-cutting issues to promote a protective, gender responsive, inclusive, and participatory response to humanitarian operations in localities identified as priority locations in the Famine Prevention Plan. Coordination: It aligns efforts to address these concerns, ensuring a coherent and effective response while avoiding duplication and maximizing impact. Accountability and Compliance: It shows a commitment to humanitarian principles and standards, demonstrating accountability and compliance.\n---\nIII.\n\nIntegrated Risk Analysis9\n\nAccountability to Affected Populations (AAP) is essential to safeguard engagement and interventions, ensuring they are made with a \"do no harm\" approach and fulfill the diverse needs, capacities, and preferences of the communities. Access to accurate and timely information is often interrupted, leaving affected populations unaware of available assistance and how to access it. A participatory and consultation approach is required to allow communities to articulate their needs, preferences, and influence decision-making in designing dignified community-based responses. IDPs are often unfamiliar with available complaints and feedback channels, leading to their voices being unheard. An interagency Complaints and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) can support the timely sharing of information, interagency referral of complaints, and resolution of cases, ensuring coordinated approaches for PSEA, disability inclusion, and gender mainstreaming. Generating and using evidence-based information will improve response and quality programming, addressing the complex and multifaceted challenges faced by women, girls, children and other at-risk/marginalized/vulnerable groups in Sudan.\n\nThe severe food insecurity and water scarcity plaguing Sudan are having devastating effects on the lives of women, girls, and children, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. Women and girls, disproportionately impacted by the ongoing conflict, face heightened risks of exploitation and abuse, and the looming threat of famine only compounds their suffering. With many eating less and last, their vulnerability is significantly increased. High food insecurity is\n\nIASC. 2018. Results of collaboration/linkages between AAP and PSEA. IASC.; IASC.

As families and communities struggle to cope, they often resort to harmful strategies, including rape, intimate partner violence (IPV), child and forced marriage, trafficking, and transactional sex as survival mechanisms. Efforts to access food also can lead to SEA.\n\nGender disparities in access to resources are pronounced in Sudan. Women and girls are often the last to receive food and essential supplies, which heightens their vulnerability during crises. Gender inequality exacerbates both food insecurity and gender-based violence (GBV), establishing a direct correlation between escalating food insecurity and heightened risks of GBV, disproportionately affecting women and girls. As the famine threat looms, the negative consequences for displaced women and girls intensify. These constraints, framed by inequities between men and women, result in women having less power and access to food production, supplies, and other essential resources related to food.\n\nWomen and girls make up the majority of the more than 8.5 million forcibly displaced, with around 150,000 pregnant women unable to access proper care due to two-thirds of health centers not functioning. Displaced women face increased protection and health risks, often resorting to drastic actions such as survival sex or forced marriage. Among the more than 4.86 million people facing acute hunger in Sudan, 1.2 million are pregnant and breastfeeding women suffering from acute malnutrition. In food insecure emergency settings, women and girls eat last and least in their households, leading to 79% of women not meeting their daily minimum dietary requirements. In internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, women and girls have limited access to healthcare, sanitation, and hygiene facilities due to the breakdown of infrastructure. This exacerbates health risks and increases their vulnerability to violence and exploitation. The lack of separate sanitation facilities, lighting, and safe spaces further compounds these risks. Additionally, cultural norms around gender roles and responsibilities shape how shelter and non- food items (NFIs) are used within households, making it crucial to understand and respect these norms for effective programming.\n\nChildren's protection and psychosocial well-being are also severely impacted. Families, prioritizing access to food, often divert funds meant for other essential services, leading to increased risks of abuse, exploitation, and neglect. In such scenarios education often becomes a secondary concern many children migrate to cities in search of work, exposing themselves to further risks. The vulnerability of women and girls to these forms of violence could further intensify in the absence of appropriate interventions. Water scarcity forces women and children to walk long distances in search of water, making them prey to armed men. In urban areas, child protection partners report increasing numbers of children begging or providing underpaid casual labor. Women and girls face additional challenges in managing menstrual hygiene due to limited\n---\naccess to essential products like sanitary pads, which hinders their ability to participate in public life, including humanitarian distributions and decision-making processes.\n\nThe risks of SEA are amplified during an emergency as actors providing aid exert power, and new actors enter the environment, which presents an opportunity for exploitation and abuse. The SEA Risk Overview (SEARO) Index10 update as of May 2024 assesses Sudan as the sixth out of 34 (6.7) most at-risk of SEA in humanitarian or aid settings. This means that recipients of aid in\n\nSudan are at a higher risk of SEA by the aid workers. Moreover, in Sudan, remote programming due to the conflict and heavy reliance on new actors, such as NGOs and CBOs, to deliver assistance, who may not have been engaged on PSEA in the past, also increases the risk. For example, staff relocations and turnover affecting GBV/PSEA capacities, all contribute to the increased vulnerability of the affected populations or as the flow of aid continues to increase, new humanitarian actors and staff may not be fully oriented in PSEA and thus underprepared to prevent, mitigate, and even respond to reports.\n\nSudanese culture is patriarchal, and its hierarchical nature can strengthen pre-existing gender disparities and inequalities and expose crisis affected populations to further risk of SEA. On top of that, factors like shame, discrimination, fear of stigma and retaliation, lack of trust, a culture of silence and family pressure to resolve GBV/SEA incidents through amicable/out-of-court settlement and lack of information have prevented GBV/SEA survivors from seeking the support they require.\n\nViolence against women and girls with disabilities is a critical issue that is related to both gender and disability-based discrimination and exclusion. Put together, these two factors result in an extremely high risk of violence against girls and women with disabilities. Girls with disabilities remain at risk of GBV, comprising rape, SEA. Moreover, the risks of SEA remain high due to widespread economic hardship, driven by increasing prices of basic goods such as food, water, and fuel. The lack of suitable shelter and hunger can heighten the risk of all forms of GBV and SEA for women, girls, and boys, who may engage in survival or transactional sex in exchange for humanitarian aid. Several factors have exponentially increased the risk of SEA. It is worth mentioning that \u00ab[w]hile there is not much research available on the prevalence of sexual\n\nThe Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Risk Overview (SEARO) is a Composite Index that brings together indicators on a range of different factors that can influence the risk of SEA. SEARO categorizes countries with ongoing humanitarian response operations according to their level of risk, enabling\u202fcomparisons of risk between countries\u202fand assessing how those risks change over\u202ftime. Cfr. IASC PSEA. \u00ab SEARO: Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Risk Overview \u00bb.\n---\nSudan Operations Coordination Centre violence and SEA of men and boys in humanitarian settings, data shows that 1 in 13 boys globally have experienced sexual abuse or sexual exploitation before the age of 18 \u00bb.11\n\nReferring to women and girls again, it is also important to underline that as the situation is fluid and families prioritize evacuating them, they are at a higher risk for abuse during their displacement (while seeking out safety and security). With services being down, such as power and phone lines, hotlines may be unreachable to victims/survivors and families willing to report abuses and violations. Additionally, the lack of humanitarian access to affected populations limits protection by presence. The dire economic situation, including lack of liquidity, loss of livelihoods, poverty, food insecurity, lack of or limited humanitarian assistance contribute to the problem as well. The involvement of military personnel in the provision of humanitarian assistance or at border points, disrupted reporting mechanisms, and the breakdown in the rule of\n\nlaw, formal government reporting channels are affected which will likely impact survivor\u2019s willingness to seek redress and support, all contribute to the increased vulnerability of the affected populations.\n\nFinally, identified project-related risks can include: - Women and girls can face high risks in relation with accessing to cash/ food distribution sites. For instance, traveling long distances to reach the distribution sites for collecting assistance exacerbates targeting, exploitation and harm from non- partner individuals including armed groups/forces and other individuals. - Children may be neglected or exploited, this could involve drop out of school, child labor, early and force marriage, or recruitment into armed groups. - Personnel handling registration and payment including cooperating partner staff and bank staff demonstrate risky and harmful misconduct related to SEA. - Some location of project activities in a humanitarian/conflict-affected environment where rates of GBV are already likely to be high, as increased by the emergency context. - High likelihood that protective services or GBV response options are not fully accessible in some project locations because of insecurity and bad road status during rainy season. - High poverty incidence among refugees, displaced and conflict-affected communities in targeted areas under the project. - Limited capacity and resources, the large scale of the crisis may overwhelm existing humanitarian resources and infrastructure. Moreover, the lack of trained personnel, especially on GBV response and PSEA protocols.\n\nWomen\u2019s Refugee Commission. 2024.

In addition, PSEA Capacity Assessment to be conducted for UN Implementing Partners (IPs). Furthermore, Clusters Coordinators to work with Working Groups and dedicated capacity to identify areas of higher risk.\n\nNeeds assessments: Ensure all categories of people are consulted and responded to as appropriate according to their specific needs. Where a needs assessment is undertaken, assessment teams must include women, and should be gender balanced. Enumerators should receive training/orientation on interpersonal communication skills, gender, age, disability sensitivities, PSEA (see Annex I on SEA Risk Mitigation and Annex II on SEA Prevention and Mitigation Checklist), Code of Conduct (CoC), mandatory reporting, referral pathways, and existing complaint and feedback mechanisms.\n\nPhoto: OCHA Sudan/Anne-Judith Ndombasi K.N., 2024\n\nConduct community mobilization and outreach activities to raise awareness on child protection, disability risks, GBV and PSEA. Provide information on available services and consult directly with at-risk individuals to ensure they are informed about the accessibility and availability of humanitarian services, and that their concerns and needs are heard. Ensure meaningful inclusion of gender, age, disability, and other forms of diversity by strengthening platforms and opportunities for women, local women's organizations, girls, boys, and PWDs to express their views.

Train frontline workers social workers to safely handle disclosures, receive reports, offer support, and safely refer survivors to specialized services. Also, training for PSEA Focal Points and frontline distribution staff on how to refer interagency complaints, and knowledge of internal organizational policy for referral of SEA cases to be conducted.\n\nEnsure your organization have accountability and safeguarding policies/guidelines, including a mandatory PSEA Code of Conduct. All employees and affiliates sign a CoC that clearly demonstrates the zero-tolerance policy for SEA behavior.\n\nCommunicate information to be meaningful, timely, reliable, culturally appropriate, gender responsive and easy-to-understand and read across sex, age, and diverse groups. Ensure the provision of safe, timely, reliable, and relevant information and materials that are appropriate, equitable, inclusive, context-specific, and sensitive to cultural and gender considerations. These materials should address issues that impact individuals' lives, their access to services or assistance, their rights, and entitlements, and include guidance on aid actors' Code of Conduct and ways to exercise these rights.\n---\nFor instance, information on humanitarian interventions to be in structures and languages preferred, trusted, accessible and through different methods (e.g., extension workers, radio, sms messaging, posters, newsletters, television, or loudspeaker), so that information reaches everyone (e.g., literate, illiterate or children).\n\n10. Set up accessible, confidential, and well-understood mechanisms for suggestions and complaints. Mechanisms should be transparent, accessible, safe, easy-to-use and ensure respect of everyone involved and must include both collective and confidential channels. Community-based complaint mechanisms for SEA must be victim-centered, inclusive, and gender and age responsive, in line with the guiding principles of safety, confidentiality, respect, and non-discrimination. It is important that all staff who may receive a SEA complaint receive training on intake, referral, and feedback of SEA incidents (allegations, rumors, and cases), together with GBV and Child Protection sub- Clusters teams and wear forms of identification (i.e., vests, shirts, hats, or similar). Moreover, monitor the effectiveness of handling sensitive complaints and adapt accordingly.\n\nIV.\n\nKey Cluster Recommendations\n\nFood Security and Livelihoods Cluster Ensure the active participation of women, girls and other at-risk groups in all food security, agricultural and nutrition assessment processes. Assess and identify potential SEA risks at the food distribution centres/sites. Ensure that female and child-headed households, other at-risk groups and small-scale producers and traders are identified and targeted for food assistance, including in-kind and agricultural inputs distribution and cash-based transfers. Women and girls, including older women, pregnant and nursing women, and girls, in all household types should be targeted by malnutrition prevention and response initiatives. Food distributions, and emergency agricultural support should not put women and girls at additional risks, including long journeys to and from distribution points. Therefore, it is paramount that specific protection vulnerabilities that affect their exposure to food insecurity and GBV be taken into consideration.\n---\nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene Cluster \u25cf Enhancement of WASH service providers and frontline worker\u2019s capacities in GBV/SEA prevention, risk mitigation, reporting, and response. \u25cf Identify any protection risks associated with WASH facilities, e.g., sexual assault and sexual abuse of women, girls and boys around water points, latrines and bathing facilities, potential for injury of people with disability or older people around wet areas. For instance, responses need to be careful not to increase protection risks. E.g., bathing facilities and latrines without lights and locks can put women and children at risk of sexual abuse. \u25cf Consider the distance and the route that women and girls must cover to collect water if distributing water. This has implications in terms of a time burden and potential protection risks if it becomes known that they regularly take that route unaccompanied. \u25cf Creation of any new facilities to promote hygiene in the community should be developed in consultation with women, girls, men, and boys in the community. Locations should be accessible to all especially to older women, women, and girls with disabilities, to reduce risk of GBV in accessing these facilities. \u25cf Regulate and timetable water distributions to avoid large groups congregating to prevent viral spread. \u25cf Distribute soap and sanitizer products through community mobilization initiatives. Ensure women are included as recipients and in the distribution process. \u25cf Understanding the respective needs of women, girls, men, and boys helps promote access to, and the appropriate use of, facilities. For example, WASH facilities that are adequately designed with privacy and safety measures (including segregation, locks, adequate lighting) increase the acceptability of the facilities for women and girls to use them. Facilities specifically designed for younger girls and boys, i.e., with a smaller toilet bowl and lower washbasin, also encourage use. \u25cf Provide clear information to communities explaining that beneficiaries, particularly women and girls, do not have to pay or provide services or favours in exchange for water or WASH services. \u25cf Use inputs and feedback from women, girls, men, and boys in a participatory manner to increase hygiene and encourage measures such as handwashing in ways that\n\nresonate with the community. Utilize women and girls\u2019 potential in community mobilization and hygiene promotion.\n---\nHealth Cluster \u25cf Assess and identify potential SEA risks at the health facilities. \u25cf Ensure that all data gathered is sex, age, and disability disaggregated (SADDD), as well as pregnancy status. \u25cf Provide community messaging that pregnant women and girls should continue with their natal care and seek out assisted deliveries. Such messaging should also advise them on precautionary measures they must take relating to their pregnancy; explain that beneficiaries, particularly women and girls, do not have to pay or provide services or favours in exchange for health nutrition assistance. These messages should be conveyed by health care workers and social mobilizers. \u25cf Dignity for patients attending treatment centers must be maintained - particularly for women and girls with separate ablutions, toilets, and privacy screens as well as safe disposal bins for used sanitary items.\n\nWhen access to health care is negotiated (specifically in negotiations with countries hosting refugees), ensure that referral pathways and access also meet the specific needs and priorities of women and girls. Facilitate the development and dissemination of targeted messaging on preventive, protective and care-seeking behaviors and on available health resources responsive to the different contexts and concerns of women, men, boys, and girls. Provision of the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) service package should be adhered to as the minimum standards for Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) provision.\n\nNutrition Cluster \u25cf Consult with at-risk groups about ways to minimise safety risks associated with health and nutrition services, e.g., safe locations and routes to health facilities, providing accessibility features at facilities for people with disability (such as handrails and ramps). \u25cf Monitor the nutritional status and needs of women, girls, men, boys, such as rates of malnutrition among children under five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, adolescent girls, and older men and women. \u25cf Ensure the participation of women, men, boys, and girls in the planning of interventions to accurately reflect their unique perspectives, requirements, and challenges in access activities. \u25cf Provide information to communities explaining that beneficiaries, particularly women and girls, do not have to pay or provide services or favours in exchange for health assistance.\n---\nPrioritize breastfeeding promotion, complementary feeding, and management of acute malnutrition for pregnant and breastfeeds women and girls. Provide pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls with supplementary feeding programs to address increased nutritional needs. Address specific nutritional deficiencies and provide education on nutrition. Ensure that older men and women have access to nutritious food that meets their specific dietary requirements. Consider the safety of accessing nutrition services, particularly for women and girls, to prevent exposure to GBV.\n\nShelter/Non-Food Items Cluster \u25cf Assess protection, including GBV/SEA risks in shelter and NFI interventions. E.g., a lack of access to shelter causing community tension or conflict; poor or crowded evacuation centres leading to a risk of women, girls or boys experiencing GBV, including the risks of SEA. \u25cf Consult directly with vulnerable people to make sure their concerns and needs are heard, e.g., create and strengthen platforms for women, girls and boys, and people with disability to speak for themselves (provision of ramps and handrails for people with disability). \u25cf Involve people with different disabilities to check that the shelter/ building is truly accessible. \u25cf Consult with at-risk groups about ways to increase safety for shelter and NFI distributions and building activities, e.g., safe locations and routes to distribution sites; timing of distributions during daylight hours; priority queues for at-risk people; safety patrols; accessibility features at distribution sites. \u25cf Assess the shelter needs of vulnerable community members by sex, age, and disability, and prioritize these (e.g., include women and child heads of households, and children with disability). \u25cf Community mobilization, risk communication and surveillance mechanisms for shelter locations should be localized with women taking a leadership role in their design and implementation. \u25cf Specific focus on the protection of female-headed households, older people, and those with pre-existing conditions from SEA must be included in all housing rights and tenure security initiatives. Where appropriate, a moratorium on eviction and rental support interventions should be considered. \u25cf Installation of additional WASH resources in densely populated areas must consider safety and protection concerns for women and girls. Locks, lighting, accessibility, and sex-segregation must be integral to their design.\n---\nThe provision of NFIs must include adequate supplies and dispersal of dignity kits, sanitary materials and other materials related to reproductive health that are culturally appropriate. The selected items for the dignity kits should be based on a participatory consultation with women and girls to ensure their specific and distinct needs and requirements are addressed. Distribution should be accompanied with sensitization on the safe disposal of sanitary supplies/materials to counter potential increased stigma and sanitation issues around menstruation. Any changes in times or locations of distribution of NFIs should be implemented only after consultation with women, men, girls, and boys in the community. In some areas, women may predominantly be responsible for collection, and it is critical that alternate locations and times are accessible for women and do not further increase their burden.\n\nSite Management \u25cf Ensure site planning and management is culturally appropriate. \u25cf Consult with the affected population with engagement of adolescent girls, women (e.g., single, or widowed women), children (e.g., single girl-headed households) and PWDs (e.g., women and girls with disabilities) on site planning and management and consider the specific risks faced by these individuals. \u25cf Demonstrate high quality coordination during site planning management with cross- cutting actors to protect women and girls from GBV, SEA risks. \u25cf Engage with the affected population to establish accessible and safe CFM including SEA reporting channels. \u25cf Any re-planning of sites and accommodation of individuals must consider protection and rights of women and girls \u2013 including segregated and safe WASH facilities, lighting, accommodation for single women and men, female-headed households, child-headed households, and separated children. \u25cf Site community engagement must include representation of women a", "65932": "title: Sudan PSEA Network Prevention and Mitigation Checklist1 August 2024 \n content: Sudan PSEA Network Prevention and Mitigation Checklist1 August 2024\n\nPurpose\n\nThis Checklist is designed to be used for the assessment/observation of interventions to identify, prevent, and mitigate potential SEA and SEA risks in field activities, including cluster response activities in Sudan. The \u2018Checklist\u2019 includes basic recommendations on measures to take to mitigate SEA risks.\n\nThe tool has individual sections for different types of sector activities: (I) Food/Hygiene/Basic Assistance In-Kind Distribution, (II) Shelter/Non-Food Items (NFIs), (III) Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), (IV) Health, (V) Education Observational, (VI) Protection, (VII) Cash-Based Interventions, (VIII) Camp management, and (IX) General Observations and Additional Comments. Organizations can review these sections, select and use the ones that are relevant for their projects and programme activities.\n\nWho Should Administer the Tool?\n\nThe tool can be administered by field staff who observe a particular field activity, review the existence/absence of indicators and mark them in the Checklist. It can be used as a physical document or in an online survey format through tools such as Kobo. While any field staff can use the Checklist, some Organizations opt to use Monitoring &Evaluation (M&E) or Third-Party Monitoring (TPM) field enumerators to administer the tool as part of already existing, ongoing M&E activities. It is essential that staff administering the tool receive training about gender, gender-based violence (GBV), PSEA and referrals, and understand the purpose of the tool and how it is supposed to be applied.\n\nStaff should be prepared and informed on the following essential points:\n\na) not to interact with or ask questions to beneficiaries for the implementation of this tool and;\n\nThis document has been adapted from the Lebanon PSEA Network Prevention and Mitigation Checklist;\n\nEthiopia PSEA Network Prevention and Mitigation Checklist; and PSEA WoS Network and WoS GBV AoR Field Checklist for GBV and PSEA Mainstreaming.\n---\nb) be informed about existing safe, confidential, accessible, disability-inclusive, child-friendly, responsive and multi-channel effective and high-quality complaints and feedback mechanisms for reporting in case they need to report a complaint about sexual or other type of misconduct.\n\nHow Should the Tool be Used?\n\nWhen utilized in the programme design stage, use of the tool involves review of the Checklist by the programme manager/coordinator to identify any gaps and risks in the current design. When utilized in field implementation and monitoring, the tool is used by field staff observing a field activity and noting their observations of the indicators included in the Checklist. Regardless of which area of programming it is used, the tool is intended to result in actions to fill gaps and mitigate identified risks. The results of the Checklist should be used to strengthen PSEA mainstreaming in programme design and implementation, and recommendations and actions can be tracked by the Organization.\n\nSome examples of activities and sites where the field Checklist is applied are : Food/Hygiene/Basic distribution, shelter/NFI/Cash-Based distribution, health clinics, WASH/educational/camp activities and community centres, health clinics. Enumerators may need to clarify some issues with field staff delivering the activity on-site, but the Checklist should never be applied in a survey interview or question and answer-based format. Staff should administer the tool by visiting the field activity while it is ongoing. Programme managers and PSEA Focal Points (hereafter FPs) are recommended to coordinate observation plans together by identifying field activities to be observed, as well as dates, locations and staff who will carry out the observation. It is recommended that an Organization carry out this observation for all their field activities and ongoing projects, and if feasible, at all locations. If it is not possible to carry out observations at all locations, the Agency may select a sample size of locations or use locations and sample sizes already in use by M&E teams. Other staff at the site should be informed and prepared for the arrival of the staff member for observation, and the observer should be permitted to observe the activity while it occurs. During the observation, the observer will go through the Checklist and mark whether they observe the presence or absence of each indicator. If an indicator is not applicable to their context and/or activity, they can mark \u201cnot applicable\u201d or \u201cN/A\u201d.\n\nFrequency of application is up to the preference and capacity of each Organization. It is recommended that it be applied at least once during a project cycle. In the case of identified gaps/challenges, the exercise should be repeated to assess whether previously identified gaps/risks have been addressed. Some Organizations also opt to integrate indicators from the Checklist into related M&E activities and therefore apply the Checklist within the context of ongoing, regular M&E schedules.\n\nHow Should the Data be Analyzed? The relevant programme managers and PSEA FPs should review the results of the observation(s) together to: a) Identify gaps and risks (through applying the tool); b) Brainstorm actions/solutions to fill the identified gaps and/or mitigate the risks; c) Implement the action plan and initiate relevant changes; d) Track the actions taken to resolve and mitigate identified risks/issues Action points will be based on the types of issues being identified through this observation activity. Some gaps and risks might be very easy to address. For example, if distribution\n---\nsites are missing PSEA awareness raising materials and complaint hotline numbers are not visible to beneficiaries, this can easily and quickly be resolved through the dissemination of materials made available by the PSEA Network. Other types of gaps or risks may require more time or decision making that involves the Head of office (HoO), re-alignment/adjustment of budgets, etc. For example, if there is an absence of oversight by humanitarian staff or female humanitarian staff in some activities, staff allocation may need to be reviewed to ensure that activities do not continue unmonitored, or the Agency may need to hire more female staff to fill the gaps. In other cases where a field activity is implemented by contractors or local companies, a review of procedures relating to those companies and their staff may be needed by Human Resources (HR). SEA prevention and mitigation is an ongoing process, so Agencies should take timely corrective actions as feasible, while continuing to work on any longer-term issues that require more time and effort.\n\nSafety & Ethical Considerations\n\nField observers who will administer should be prepared and understand how to use the tool. It should clearly be communicated that the tool is observational. There are also safety and ethical considerations depending on the type of staff administering the tool. Staff who have never been exposed to protection, GBV and PSEA related topics must be trained on gender, gender-based violence (GBV), and PSEA prior to observation. This training should be provided by the Agencies\u2019 PSEA Focal Point(s) or those who have been directly trained by the PSEA Focal Point.\n\nReminder:\n\nObservers should be equipped with a PSEA Inter-Agency reporting hotline (if available), organizational reporting hotline or other safe, confidential, accessible, disability-inclusive, child- friendly, responsive and multi-channel effective and high-quality complaints and feedback mechanisms in case they encounter a violation / misconduct that must be reported.\n\nN.B:\n\nThe Sudan PSEA Network is available to provide additional technical assistance and support in helping to address identified gaps/risks.\n---\n|    | 0             | 1                                           |\n|----|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|  0 | Type of Site: | Urban, rural, IDP gathering site, or other. |\n---\nIn the following sections, complete all relevant sections for the service/activities you are observing on this date.
