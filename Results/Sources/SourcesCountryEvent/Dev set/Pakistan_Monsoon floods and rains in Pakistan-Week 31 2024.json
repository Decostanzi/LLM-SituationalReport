Even the below-normal rains in July caused at least 123 deaths nationwide, besides destroying roads, bridges, houses and other infrastructure, and killing livestock. Punjab, KP and Gilgit-Baltistan remain the most affected areas. The fresh monsoon spell that started on Thursday has also resulted in loss of life and property as floods washed away bridges and roads in KP and GB, while a record-breaking spell submerged Lahore and other cities in Punjab. Thousands of tourists are stuck in parts of KP and GB as some areas are cut off from the rest of the country after flash floods swept away roads and bridges. Essential services, including hospital emergencies, electricity, and air and rail transportation, were badly disrupted. The NDMA has warned that various parts of the country are likely to experience urban and flash flooding going forward as the current spell is projected to last till Aug 6. Another round of torrential rains is forecast for the period from Aug 7 to Aug 15. Earlier in spring, nearly 100 people lost their lives in incidents related to unseasonal rains.\nWith the rising frequency and intensity of rain-related disasters, induced by climate change and often resulting in significant loss of life and destruction, it is imperative for policymakers to build climate-resilient infrastructure. But that needs time and international financial support to fill the resource gap for the required investment. Yet they must urgently reinforce climate defence by building capacity for early forecasts of unusual weather patterns, and for evacuating, rescuing and rehabilitating communities at risk. There is no doubt that our disaster authorities have built up significant capacity in these areas since the 2010 floods. However, the 2022 deluge laid bare several gaps, clearly showing that the national and provincial disaster authorities remain ill equipped and ill prepared to deal with catastrophes on such a large scale. A very big number of the nearly 33m people affected by one of the most destructive floods in the nation\u2019s history could not even be reached for rescue when the deluge hit; a huge number remains displaced.

How can the seafood industry flourish in such conditions?\u201d he added.\nAkhtar stressed that declining fish stocks and harbour navigation issues have had major economic repercussions for local fishing communities.\nHe cited the example of Balochistan\u2019s Pasni harbour, which has been closed for more than a decade due to siltation, an outcome of underwater land instability and mud volcanic activity.\nThe sedimentation and resulting changes in water quality have adversely impacted local fish populations, leading to reduced catches for fishermen in the area, he explained.\nHe said a comparison of satellite images from 2003 to 2023 revealed a significant development of a sandspit over the past two decades, which altered the hydrodynamic conditions, leading to major changes in the coastline and sand deposition.\nSolar solution\nMany fishermen in Pasni have fallen into a debt trap, borrowing money to cover the surging costs of fuel, maintenance and other expenses, according to maritime researcher Naufil Shahrukh.\n\u201cThe pressure of mounting debts and lack of a steady income is leading to severe mental health issues among the community, including depression and hopelessness,\u201d he told Anadolu.\nA potential solution to address issues related to climate change and rising fuel costs could be solar-powered fishing boats, he said.\n\u201cSolarisation of fishing vessels, fish harbours or fish landing sites and off-grid marine tourism sites for the socioeconomic development of the indigenous fisherfolk \u2026 should be an essential part of Pakistan\u2019s fisheries, environmental and energy policies,\u201d said Shahrukh.\nAdopting solar technology will reduce fuel and maintenance costs, adding to its environmental benefits, he said, pointing out that similar projects have yielded positive results in India and the Philippines.\n\u201cAlong with achieving sustainable development goals and promoting the blue economy, it will also help local fishermen get rid of the debt trap,\u201d he said.", "53075": "title: Tribal clashes in Kurram come to halt after claiming 49 lives within a week: DC \n content: Tribal clashes which have been ongoing for the past seven days in different areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s Kurram District claiming 49 lives and leaving more than 200 people injured have come to a halt, the deputy commissioner (DC) said on Tuesday.\nAccording to the police and district administration, armed clashes between Boshehra and Maleekhel tribesmen had begun on the evening of July 24.

The group meets regularly to coordinate needs, emergency response and gaps related to education in emergency situations. It is an open forum for agencies and practitioners who work in education and education in emergencies. Currently, the DRR Working Group (DRRWG) provides coordination support to DRRWG members, including provincial education ministry and district education departments, humanitarian organizations such as INGOs, NGOs, CSOs, UN agencies, and development partners at the provincial and district level.\nIn response to monsoon floods of 2022 School Education and Literacy Department (SELD) Sindh in collaboration with UNICEF developed crises impact and response data system.\nA dashboard developed to visualize Education crisis impact and response through key figures, which provided overview of overall situation including needs response and gap. Dashboard contains damaged schools\u2019 data, collected online through head teachers along with the nature of damages and with evidence / pictures.\nThe DRRWG is coordinating the implementation of the 2022 flood response plan, the Education Cannot Wait (ECW) Multi-year Resilience Program (MYRP), the capacity building of Education sector members, and preparedness response plan.\nIn 2nd phase, the response data also collected from partners which includes data and reporting on various key response interventions such as TLCs, Trainings of teachers, SMC members, provision of educational supplies, school rehabilitation and reconstruction. User manuals developed and training sessions for stakeholders were conducted to enabling them to maximize the utilization of database.\nBackground\nThe field of Education in Emergencies (EiE) has emerged in response to the growing number of children and youth affected by crises around the world. These crises can be natural disasters, armed conflicts, security challenges, or other complex emergencies (earthquake, flood, COVID, etc.) that disrupt education and threaten the safety and well-being of learners.\nIn 2000, the UN adopted the Education for All (EFA) goals, which included a commitment to providing quality education for all children, including those affected by emergencies. This commitment led to increased investment in EiE programmes and trainings.\nThe 2022 floods in Pakistan had a devastating impact on education in Sindh, one of the worst-hit provinces.\nSindh suffered damage or destruction to over 19,808 schools. This forced the closure of countless schools, disrupting the education of millions of children. Repurposing many schools as temporary shelters for displaced families further disrupted regular school operations. This displacement also made it difficult for many children to reach their schools, even if they were still functioning.\nThe RSU, SELD-led DRR Working Group, which meets regularly to support the coordination of emergency response activities, including need identification, response planning, gap identification, and capacity building of partners to support the harmonised and coordinated response, is in charge of the flood response in Sindh.\nEiE training has played a critical role in improving the quality of education in emergencies, and it continues to be essential for ensuring that children and youth affected by crises have access to safe and quality learning opportunities.\nEducation in Emergencies (EiE) training equips individuals and organizations with the knowledge, skills, and resilience to provide quality education in the midst of crises. These crises can range from natural disasters like floods, monsoons, droughts, and earthquakes to ongoing conflicts and humanitarian emergencies.\nThe Education Sector Working Group (ESWG), with the support of the global cluster on education, conducted an analysis of preparedness. Some of the key areas identified for focus included conducting lesson-learning exercises, building capacity among partners, standardising education in emergency response packages, including training manuals, and EiE advocacy messages.Save the Children, with the support of the Humanitarian Leadership Academy (HLA), organized the EiE training at the national level in Pakistan.\nUnder ESWG preparedness, the Reform Support Unit (RSU) of the Sindh Education and Literacy Department (SELD), with UNICEF support, conducted EiE trainings in Sindh. UNICEF, Save the Children, and Right to Play facilitators led the EIE training sessions.\nObjective of EiE trainings\nThe overall objective of EiE training is to equip Sindh DRR working group members with the necessary skills and knowledge of education in emergencies to deliver quality education in crisis situations. This encompasses a range of specific goals, aiming to:\n\u2022 Enhance the capacity of district-level education departments, LSU coordinators, and INGOs/NGOs staff who need to rapidly improve their knowledge of the fundamental concepts, phases, and tools of EiE.\n\u2022 Develop selected INEE Level 1, 2, and 3 competencies (explain, describe, identify, assess, analyse, evaluate, design, apply, use, develop, engage, and participate).", "60146": "title: Climate change, fuel costs push Pakistan\u2019s fishing industry into more choppy waters \n content: Climate change, fuel costs push Pakistan\u2019s fishing industry into more choppy waters\nRising sea levels and temperatures, ocean acidification, coastal erosion and other environmental factors pose grave risks, says expert\n- Rising sea levels and temperatures, ocean acidification, coastal erosion and other environmental factors pose grave risks, says expert\n- Overall fish catches could be down by 25% to 30% this year, according to industry figure\n- Shift to solar-powered fishing boats could be a potential solution, says researcher\nKARACHI, Pakistan\nClimate change and rising fuel costs are taking a heavy toll on Pakistan\u2019s already vulnerable fishing industry, with fish stocks and seafood exports plunging in recent years.\nUnchecked discharge of industrial and plastic waste and untreated sewage is being compounded by a string of environmental factors such as rising sea levels and temperatures, ocean acidification, coastal erosion, underwater land instability and mud volcanic activity, according to Muhammad Jawad Akhtar, a former maritime adviser at Pakistan\u2019s Planning and Development Ministry.\n\u201cThe combined effects of pollution, underwater land instability and climate change in Pakistan, mainly in Karachi, have significantly impacted the country\u2019s fishing sector, altering marine environments, reducing fish populations and damaging infrastructure,\u201d Akhtar told Anadolu.\nIndustrial and plastic waste pollution is degrading vital marine habitats such as mangroves and coral reefs that are essential for the breeding and sustenance of many fish species, he said.\nThe resulting habitat loss, changes in fish migration patterns and declining fish stocks are directly affecting local fishermen, forcing them to move toward coastal waters of the southwestern Balochistan province, he added.\n\u2018Hundreds of boats standing idle\u2019\nLocal fishing communities are also facing the challenge of rising costs, particularly as fuel prices soar due to the depreciation of the local currency.\nMohammad Iqrar, a fisherman in the southern port city and commercial hub Karachi, said his monthly operational costs have tripled over the past couple of years \u2013 from around 600,000 Pakistani rupees ($2,150) to about 1.8 million Pakistani rupees ($6,400).\n\u201cHundreds of large boats and fishing trawlers are standing idle at the harbors,\u201d Iqrar, 45, told Anadolu.\nProfit margins are much tighter and many fishermen have been forced to cut down operations, he said.\nA glimmer of hope for smaller fishing operations has been the \u201cgood rates\u201d being offered by Iranian companies, which has helped them sustain their businesses, according to Iqrar.\nDown by a quarter\nMuslim Mohamedi, a former president of the Pakistan Fisheries Exporters Association, said overall fish catches could be down by 25% to 30% this year.\n\u201cThe seafood industry is facing a jumble of issues, mainly dwindling fish stocks, increasing fuel prices and juvenile fishing that continues to persist despite a government ban,\u201d he told Anadolu.\nClimate change and sea pollution are already decreasing fish stocks, while juvenile fishing is further exacerbating the problem, he said.\n\u201cAdding to all of this is the rising price of fuel that\u2019s forcing fishermen to reduce their operations. How can the seafood industry flourish in such conditions?\u201d he added.\nAkhtar, the former ministry adviser, stressed that declining fish stocks and harbor navigation issues have had major economic repercussions for local fishing communities.\nHe cited the example of the Pasni harbor in Balochistan, which has been closed for more than a decade due to siltation, an outcome of underwater land instability and mud volcanic activity.\nThe sedimentation and resulting changes in water quality have adversely impacted local fish populations, leading to reduced catches for fishermen in the area, he explained.\nHe said a comparison of satellite images from 2003 to 2023 reveals a significant development of a sandspit over the past two decades, which has altered the hydrodynamic conditions, leading to major changes in the coastline and sand deposition.\nSolar solution\nMany fishermen in Pasni have fallen into a debt trap, borrowing money to cover the surging costs of fuel, maintenance and other expenses, according to maritime researcher Naufil Shahrukh.\n\u201cThe pressure of mounting debts and lack of a steady income is leading to severe mental health issues among the community, including depression and hopelessness,\u201d he told Anadolu.\nA potential solution to address issues related to climate change and rising fuel costs could be solar-powered fishing boats, he said.\n\u201cSolarization of fishing vessels, fish harbors or fish landing sites and off-grid marine tourism sites for the socioeconomic development of the indigenous fisherfolk \u2026 should be an essential part of Pakistan\u2019s fisheries, environmental and energy policies,\u201d said Shahrukh.\nAdopting solar technology will reduce fuel and maintenance costs, adding to its environmental benefits, he said, pointing out that similar projects have yielded positive results in neighboring India and the Philippines.\n\u201cAlong with achieving sustainable development goals and promoting the blue economy, it will also help local fishermen get rid of the debt trap,\u201d he said.Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

He asserted that rescuers across the province were actively working to help those in need.", "64976": "title: KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA DAILY SITUATION REPORT \n content: PDMA PROVINCIAL DISASTER MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY Provincial Emergency Operation Center Plot 46 A, Sector B\u00ad2, Phase V, Hayatabad,Peshawar Phone: (091) 9219635, 9219636, Fax: (091) 9219637 www.pdma.gov.pk\n\nNo. PDMA/PEOC/DSR/2024/Jul\u00adE\u00ad28\u00ad25\n\nKHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA DAILY SITUATION REPORT\n\nDate: 28/07/2024\n\n|    | 0          | 1                                              | 2                                                                 | 3                      | 4               | 5                      | 6   |   7 |   8 |   9 |   10 |   11 |   12 |   13 |   14 |   15 |   16 |   17 |   18 |   19 |   20 |\n|----|------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|  0 | DISTRICT   | NATURE OF INCIDENT                             | CAUSE OF INCIDENT                                                 | HUMAN LOSSES/ INJURIES | CATTLE PERISHED | INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGES |     | nan | nan | nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |\n|  1 |            | DEATH                                          | INJURED                                                           | HOUSES                 | SCHOOLS         | OTHERS                 |     | nan | nan | nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |\n|  2 |            | Mae Female Child Total Male Female Child Total | Fully Partially Total Fully Partially Total Fully Partially Total |                        |                 |                        |     | nan | nan | nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |  nan |\n|  3 | Swabi      | Heavy Rain                                     | Boundary Wall Collapse                                            | 0                      | 0               | 0                      | 0   |   0 |   0 |   0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|  4 | Abbottabad | Heavy Rain                                     | Land Sliding                                                      | 0                      | 0               | 0                      | 0   |   5 |   0 |   0 |    5 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|  5 |            | Total(s)                                       | 0                                                                 | 0                      | 0               | 0                      | 5   |   0 |   0 |   5 |    0 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |  nan |\n\n|    | 0          | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 2                                                   | 3                  | 4        | 5      |\n|----|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------|--------|\n|  0 |            | DISTRICT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                     | DETAIL OF INCIDENT | RESPONSE | SOURCE |\n|  1 | Abbottabad | On 28\u00ad07\u00ad2024, due to heavy rainfall landsliding occurred in the area of Donga Gali.

The army is primarily trained to combat foreign enemies and assist the civilian government only when law and order are beyond civilian control. For example, during the Paris Olympics, over 10,000 military personnel provided security but returned to barracks after the event. In Pakistan, however, due to the persistent failures of political and civil leaders, the army is repeatedly called upon to manage conflicts that should be the civilian government\u2019s responsibility.\nDuring my over four decades of experience, I have frequently interacted with the Army Command when they were called to assist civilians. The army consistently argued that they should only be called upon in extreme circumstances. They emphasized that their military-grade weapons are unsuitable for use against their own citizens, which limits their effectiveness to that of the civilian government. While their presence and flag marches may initially intimidate the populace, this effect diminishes as people grow accustomed to the army\u2019s involvement in civilian matters.\nThe involvement of the army in civilian affairs, driven by the incompetence of politicians and the civil administration, has severely damaged its image. Visible and virulent movements against the army have emerged in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) in KP advocates for the rights of the Pashtun people, aiming to end extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and unlawful detentions, while demanding justice and human rights. In Balochistan, groups like the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Baloch Republican Army (BRA), Baloch Liberation Front (BLF), and United Baloch Army (UBA) engage in armed struggle and propaganda against the army, further complicating the situation. This standoff has led to numerous incidents of violence, including the recent clash in Gwadar where a protest by the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee turned violent, resulting in the death of one soldier and injuries to 16 others. The loss of life, whether of a protester or a soldier, is deeply painful for every Pakistani patriot, underscoring the urgent need for competent governance and peaceful resolution of conflicts.\nLike violent movements that should have no place in a democratic country, another deeply worrying phenomenon reflecting a serious fault line in our national fabric is the issuance of fatwas calling for the death of anyone contradicting the fatwa giver\u2019s religious philosophy. There has been a history of such illegal fatwas in Pakistan. In 2012, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan issued a fatwa against Malala Yousafzai for advocating girls\u2019 education, leading to an assassination attempt. In 2011, a fatwa was issued against Salman Taseer for criticizing blasphemy laws, resulting in his assassination. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy faced fatwas in 2016 for her documentary on honour killings. Militant groups like TTP issued fatwas against polio vaccinations, claiming they were a Western conspiracy, leading to attacks on health workers. The 1974 fatwa against Ahmadis declared them non-Muslims, resulting in severe persecution. The Women\u2019s Protection Bill in 2006 faced fatwas for attempting to protect women from domestic violence. Javed Ahmad Ghamidi faced threats and was forced to leave Pakistan in 2005 due to his progressive views. Judges involved in the 2018 acquittal of Asia Bibi faced death fatwas from extremist groups, and those who delivered the 2019 Faizabad Dharna verdict were similarly targeted. The latest incident involves a fatwa against Supreme Court Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa.\nThe Pakistan Army faces a two-pronged jeopardy, despite the unwavering dedication of its brave soldiers and officers who frequently embrace shahadat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to protect the country and its people from terrorists, criminals, and extremists. Instead of receiving the praise they rightly deserve, a virulent propaganda campaign has been unleashed against the army on social media and traditional media platforms. While this propaganda has failed to deter the armed forces from achieving their objectives, it negatively impacts overall morale. Therefore, it is imperative to address and reverse this situation promptly. In this context, the parliament should prioritize addressing the underlying fault lines within the country instead of wasting time on self-serving laws to protect itself from the judiciary or opposition parties. The parliament must investigate and understand the real reasons and factors that have transformed a large segment of society into separatist, insurgent, extremists, religious bigots, and intolerant individuals. These elements take pride in waging armed struggle against the army, burning religious symbols of minorities, lynching individuals accused of blasphemy, slaughtering those opposed to their religious views, and issuing fatwas to murder others without judicial process, all with impunity.\nInterestingly, the district administration, special branch, and other intelligence agencies monitor all gatherings as a standard operating procedure, compiling daily reports at the district, divisional, provincial, and national levels, which ultimately reach the Prime Minister\u2019s desk every morning. Ironically, neither the Prime Minister, the parliament, nor our so-called intellectual thinkers and philosophers have taken up the challenge to reverse the ever-increasing phenomena of separatism, extremism, bigotry, intolerance, and violent behavior. Due to this impunity, these elements have become emboldened to the point of issuing fatwas against high-ranking officials, including the army chief, the prime minister, judges, and now the chief justice.\nAs a nation, we must insulate our army from civilian affairs. Politicians and civil administration should step forward boldly to handle all internal political conflicts, such as the PTM and Baloch insurgency, taking full responsibility for their success and failure. Moreover, civilian leadership must recognize that fatwas, especially those that incite violence or are criminal in nature, including those related to incitement to violence, hate speech, and terrorism, have no official legal status. Those issuing these illegal decrees must be immediately brought to justice at the district level before such issues escalate to the national level.\n\u2014The writer is a former Press Secretary to the President.", "69420": "title: Wayanad Landslide \n content: SITUATION REPORT- 3\n\nWayanad Landslide\n\nDate: 31st July 2024 (Wed) Time: 06:00 PM (IST)\n\nSITUATION UPDATE AND RESPONSE\n\nIn the early hours of July 30, massive landslides devastated Wayanad, Kerala, causing significant loss of life and property.

One of the worst humanitarian disasters in Pakistan\u2019s history, the floods led to large-scale migration from the northern mountainous regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Torwali was among those who lost their home. His fields were flooded, forcing him and his family to migrate to the Pashtun-dominated Mingora city, 59 kilometres from his hometown in the Swat district.\nThe after effects of the disaster still linger. One of the most obvious is the threat to his spoken language \u2013 Torwali. \u201cYouth who migrated to cities\u2026 are now speaking either a different Torwali dialect with many borrowed words from the dominant languages \u2013 Punjabi, Pashto, and Urdu \u2013 or cannot speak it at all,\u201d he told Dialogue Earth. His nephews now speak Pashto, the lingua franca of the province.\n\u201cClimate change has caught mountainous communities unaware with no education to assess the enormity of the crisis and no strategy on how to cope with it,\u201d Torwali said. This is exacerbated by the fact that the climate strategy of Gilgit-Baltistan portrays migration, and remittances from those that have migrated, as a positive adaptation strategy. Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s climate strategy acknowledges climate-induced migration, but limits its adaptation strategy to things like better urban planning to deal with incoming migrants. Neither acknowledges how climate-induced migration might affect the cultures and languages of northern Pakistan.\nMountainous terrain leaves small populations vulnerable\nOver 30 \u2018endangered\u2019 languages are spoken in Pakistan mountainous northern regions. The terrain means that many of these languages are only spoken by very small populations, often in the low thousands. The terrain also makes these communities vulnerable to a number of climate-induced disasters. Chitral district, which hosts over 500 glaciers, \u201cexperienced more than 13 glacial outburst floods in the 17 years leading to [2021] displacing several households and forcing them to live in temporary shelters for years\u201d. Gilgit Baltistan recorded 15 GLOF events from 1999 to 2017, in addition to the 2010 flood.\nThe knock-on effect of these disasters on the languages spoken by small populations is immense. For example, when a GLOF hit Badswat village in the Ghizer district of Gilgit-Baltistan in 2018, it forced the relocation of its Wakhi-speaking families to Gilgit city. Wakhi is spoken by only about 40,000 people and it is not the lingua franca of Gilgit city, where the new migrants had to learn to converse mainly in Shina or Pakistan\u2019s official language, Urdu.\nBut Shina itself is also under threat due to similar factors. Muhammad Wazir Baig, a Gilgit-based researcher on languages, stated that many of his relatives who lost their homes in the floods of 1978 and 2010 have relocated to Karachi. \u201cWhen I visited them last October, I found them all speaking Urdu instead of Shina,\u201d he said.\nA displacement of people and culture\nMass displacement forces mountain populations to learn new languages, and it also distances them from the geography that shaped these languages, said Fakhruddin Akhunzada, director of the Islamabad-based Forum for Language Initiative (FLI), which is dedicated to preserving endangered languages in Chitral.\n\u201cThese languages evolved in specific environments rich with livestock, farming, rivers, snow, and forested high mountains \u2013 all of which are now at risk due to climate change,\u201d Akhunzada said. These languages lose their value to the people displaced to other regions, he explained, and the displaced populations no longer observe cultural festivals, tell traditional stories, or communicate in their mother tongue. This leads to a gradual loss of proficiency in their native languages.\nWhen these distressed families relocate\u2026 they are compelled to speak the dominant language\nAmjid Saleem, University of Peshawar\nSamiullah Arman, who teaches at Edward College, Peshawar explains this as a fall in the \u201cmarket value\u201d of the language, in that it does not help people navigate their surroundings. \u201cThe higher the market value of a language, the more people will speak it, and it will thrive,\u201d said Arman, who also heads the Language, Literature and Culture Department at Mafkoora, a research and development organisation working for the preservation of local languages.\nAgreeing with Arman, Amjid Saleem, head of the English and Applied Linguistics Department at the University of Peshawar, told Dialogue Earth that displacement due to natural disasters is not just the displacement of individuals but rather of cultures. \u201cWhen these distressed families relocate\u2026 they are compelled to speak the dominant language as their native tongue is rarely spoken\u2026 in schools and marketplaces\u2026 They quickly try to learn the dominant language to overcome their sense of alienation, and this way a language erodes slowly and gradually,\u201d he said.\nLanguages only spoken at home Dr Rubina Sethi, a retired teacher at the Department of English and Applied Linguistics, University of Peshawar, emphasised that women play a crucial role in preserving a language, but the influence of this preservation depends on what children encounter outside their homes. \u201cWhile the language may be cherished and close to their hearts inside their houses, its lack of utility outside compels them to adopt the dominant language\u201d of the region to which they have been displaced, she explained.\nConfirming this, Asmatullah Dameli, a researcher who compiled the alphabet of the Dameli language in 2000, told Dialogue Earth, \u201cWe prefer to speak our mother tongue [only] inside our homes\u2026 [it] is undeniable that a time will come that coming generations will not be able to speak it.\u201d The Dameli language is spoken only by about 5,000 people, and \u2013 according to the Damel Welfare Society in Chitral district that works for the preservation of the language \u2013 around 40 per cent of that population migrated to different cities in the aftermath of the 2010 floods.\nLack of solid data limits what can be done\nMigration is driven by multiple factors, and it is difficult to establish a linear and causative relationship between climate change and forced migration.\nNonetheless, Dr Owais Ahmad, a professor of Environmental Sociology at the Sociology Department at the University of Peshawar, said climate change is the primary driver of migration from the northern regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, particularly after 2010. \u201cPeople would do everything to survive another major disaster [and] feed their families, so they come downhill alone or along with their families,\u201d he said.\nInam Torwali, in his research study titled, Future of Torwali Migrants in Urban Cities, states that 90pc of migrant families have not returned to their home towns due to financial constraints. Muhammad Wali, a researcher dedicated to preserving the Yidgha language, an ancient Iranian language spoken by only 6,000 people, added, \u201cClimate change has exacerbated the already dire poverty [in mountainous regions] and accelerated migration. Those with the means to migrate have already done so, leaving behind only those lacking the necessary resources.\u201d\nJust as the state needs to study climate change and migration, Arman said it should integrate the issue of language loss into climate change policies as part of a strategy to prevent further erosion of cultures. Saleem concurred, adding, \u201cIt is the state\u2019s responsibility to take steps to include all languages in the curriculum and ensure they are taught to children of migrating families if it aims to preserve smaller languages.\u201d\nThis article was originally published by Dialogue Earth and has been republished with permission.\nHeader image: \u2014 Illustration by Sana Nasir via Dialogue Earth", "75037": "title: Kurram clashes: How a Pakistani land dispute led to a deadly tribal battle \n content: Kurram clashes: How a Pakistani land dispute led to a deadly tribal battle\nAt least 46 people were killed and 200 injured in clashes until a temporary ceasefire was agreed upon on Wednesday.\nIslamabad, Pakistan \u2013 After weeklong clashes between rival tribes in Pakistan\u2019s district of Kurram, killing at least 46 people and injuring nearly 200, fighting has now halted, following a meeting between authorities and tribal elders.\nA grand jirga, or a gathering of tribal elders, along with civilian and security officials, met in Parachinar, the main city in Kurram district. They held an hours-long meeting on Wednesday, after which a ceasefire was agreed upon by all stakeholders \u2013 until October 5.\nKeep readinglist of 3 items\nA community under siege\nSeveral teachers killed in Pakistan school shooting\nJavedullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, said there had been no casualties since then and that the government was confident of reaching a resolution to end the conflict.\n\u201cThis is unfortunately an ongoing land dispute in the area that has led to fighting in the past as well, but we are confident that we can put an end to it this time,\u201d Mehsud told Al Jazeera.\nSo where is Kurram, what happened there, how did things escalate and what\u2019s next?\nWhere is Kurram?\nKurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42 percent belong to the Shia community.\nIt is closer to Afghanistan\u2019s capital Kabul than any major city in Pakistan but also borders Afghanistan\u2019s Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered havens for anti-Shia armed groups such as ISIL (ISIS) and the Pakistan Taliban (TTP).\nThe area has a history of sectarian conflict between the Shia and the Sunni majority groups and has also faced militancy during the past decade, with frequent attacks by TTP and other armed groups targeting the Shia community.\nAccording to local authorities and tribal leaders, the current conflict has its roots in a continuing land dispute between Shia-majority and Sunni-majority tribes. Another similar incident flared up last year, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people.\nThe Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) urged the government to help broker peace in the area where, it added, \u201cviolence has taken a heavy toll on ordinary citizens\u201d.\n\u201cHRCP calls on the KP government to ensure that the ceasefire being brokered, holds. All disputes, whether over land or born of sectarian conflict, must be resolved peacefully through negotiations convened by the KP government with all stakeholders represented,\u201d it said in a statement on July 29.\nHRCP is deeply concerned at the significant loss of life in #Parachinar, Kurram, where rival tribes have engaged in a violent land dispute for several days, fueling sectarian conflict. The violence has taken a heavy toll on ordinary citizens, whose freedom of movement and access\u2026\n\u2014 Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (@HRCP87) July 29, 2024\nWhat caused the latest clashes?\nMehmood Ali Jan, a member of the local peace committee and part of the jirga that held meetings this week, says that the conflict arose between Maleekhel, a Shia-majority tribe, and Madgi Kalay, a Sunni-majority tribe, over a tract of land in Boshehra village, situated 15km (9 miles) south of Parachinar city.\n\u201cIt was a piece of agricultural land originally owned by the Shia tribe, which they had leased to the Sunni tribe for farming purposes. The lease was supposed to end this July, but when the time came, they refused to return the land, leading to fighting,\u201d Jan told Al Jazeera.\nJan says that the local peace committee, which included members from both Shia and Sunni tribes, immediately tried to pacify the situation and asked the government to intervene. But the government, he says, was late to respond.\n\u201cThe state was completely absent initially, leading to so much fighting. They did not interfere or send in forces or police despite the heavy presence of military and paramilitary personnel in the area,\u201d Jan claimed.\nNisar Ahmad Khan, the district police officer, however, refutes the allegations of government inaction, saying that as soon as the fighting began, the state took swift action. He conceded, however, that a lack of manpower and the difficult terrain impeded the pace of the government\u2019s response.\n\u201cWe have limited capacity, and Kurram is a large, difficult area to access due to its mountainous terrain. Often, we had to hike for hours to reach places where fighting was taking place. Plus, due to the porous border with Afghanistan, many people have access to sophisticated weapons, making it even more difficult,\u201d the police officer told Al Jazeera.\nHowever, he categorically denied any involvement of TTP or any other armed group targeting the Shia community for their religious identity.\n\u201cThe Boshehra village, where most of the fighting took place, has a strategic advantage for defenders, and anyone who tried to gain access was easily targeted. In this case, it was the Maleekhel tribe, which suffered more losses,\u201d he said.\nWhy do such clashes keep happening?\nJan, the tribal elder, said even though a land dispute is at the heart of the current tensions, the region\u2019s long history of sectarian strife allows \u201csome elements\u201d from both sides to use religion as a tool to mobilise.\n\u201cThere have been major land dispute conflicts in the Kurram area between various tribes that have been ongoing since before the partition [of the Indian subcontinent in 1947]. Whenever anything triggers, it is conveniently given a sectarian angle, which is not the case,\u201d he added.\nThere have been several incidents of significant sectarian violence in the last seven decades, but the most serious clash started in 2007, in which fighting between Shia and Sunni tribes lasted for almost four years. Several villages were set ablaze and thousands of people had to leave the region and seek shelter in other parts of the country.\nKurram, which was at the time part of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), was cut off from the rest of the country. In 2011, the Pakistani military, with the help of local tribal elders, finally managed to put an end to the fighting. Government data shows nearly 2,000 people were killed in the clashes, while more than 5,000 people were reported injured.\nKhan, the police chief said that in many areas of the district, Shia and Sunni communities live together peacefully.\nHe cited the Ashura procession last month, marked to mourn the martyrdom of Husayn Ibn Ali al-Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad.\n\u201cWe recently had the Ashura processions, which were taken out in different parts of Kurram. In many areas, Sunni tribes provided security for Shias who were mourning,\u201d Khan said.\nMehsud, the deputy commissioner, said the government hoped to use the ceasefire to resolve the land dispute between the Maleekhel and Madgi Kalay tribes.\n\u201cWe have our land dispute resolution mechanisms, and this ceasefire will allow us to bring all stakeholders together to try to end this permanently,\u201d he said.\nWhat is the current situation?\nThe fighting led to the closure of most roads leading to Kurram, and news reports emerged that even ambulances were targeted by unknown men.\nSchools in Parachinar remained closed, while markets saw little activity. Jan, who is also a trader, said the closure of roads led to shortages of food and other necessary items, making it difficult for anyone needing to leave town in case of an emergency.\n\u201cAfter the ceasefire, we are hoping that life returns to normal. Right now, people are travelling in convoys only, with police and paramilitary forces guarding the roads leading out of Kurram,\u201d he said.\nJan also added that the fighting resulted in the closure of the mobile data network, but fixed lines were working.\nMehsud, the government official, said that after the pause in fighting, there is an uneasy calm in the area but he expressed hope that normal activity in the region should resume soon.\n\u201cNaturally, there is an air of fear right now, and people are reluctant to step out of their homes. However, in the last two days, we have seen some semblance of normalcy, and things should improve,\u201d he said.", "76465": "title: 1 AUGUST 2024 UNHCR-IOM FLASH UPDATE #25 \n content: 1 AUGUST 2024 UNHCR-IOM FLASH UPDATE #25\n\nARREST AND DETENTION\n\nFLOW MONITORING (15 September 2023 \u2013 27 July 2024)\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn response to the Ministry of Interior's (MoI) decision of 26 September 2023 to enact an \u201cIllegal Foreigners' Repatriation Plan\u201d, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and IOM, the UN Migration Agency, have collated their data on the arrest, detention, and deportation of Proof of Registration (PoR) holders, Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders, and undocumented Afghan nationals as well as on the outflows of Afghan nationals at the Torkham and Chaman border crossing points, to better understand the protection environment and movements of Afghan nationals returning to Afghanistan from Pakistan.\n\nWhile the Government of Pakistan has yet to halt the \u201cIFRP\u201d, the rate of arrest, detention, deportation, and returns has decreased significantly since its peak in October and November 2023.

Cumulatively, from 15 September 2023 to 27 July 2024, 679,504 individuals have returned. The number of returns in the last two weeks (14 July \u2013 27 July; 14,198) decreased by 27 per cent compared to returns in the two weeks prior to that (30 June \u2013 13 July; 19,494). The number of returns figures continue to surpass those recorded in the first quarter of 2024. Most of the returnees were undocumented Afghans (88%), followed by PoR holders (10%) and ACC holders (2%). Majority of the PoR returns are facilitated by UNHCR. Vulnerable persons including chronically ill people, elderly individuals, persons with disabilities, and others account for 3 per cent of the population. Fear of arrest (89%) remains the most common reason to return to Afghanistan among undocumented/ACC holders while PoR holders cite social economic challenges. Returnees were most likely to return from Quetta (20%) and Peshawar (18%) in Pakistan and intend to go to Kandahar (31%), Nangarhar (27%) and Kabul (15%) in Afghanistan.\n\n679,504 (100%) TOTAL NUMBER OF RETURNS\n\n603,679 (89%) TOTAL RETURNEES\n\n42,037 (6%)* TOTAL FACILITATED PoR RETURNEES\n\n33,788 (5%) TOTAL DEPORTATIONS\n\nPeriod 15 Sep \u2013 31 Dec 2023 1 Jan \u2013 13 Jul 2024 Total\n\nTotal Total Number Returnees of Returns 490,891 436,600 188,613 167,079 679,504 603,679\n\nTotal Facilitated Returnees 24,971 17,066 42,037\n\nTotal Deportees 29,320 4,468 33,788\n\nDOCUMENTATION \u2013 TOTAL NUMBER OF RETURNEES\n\nUndocumented PoR holder ** ACC\n\n88% 10% 2%\n\n167,079 Total Returnees\n\n4,468 188,613 17,066 436,600\n\nTotal Facilitated Returns\n\n29,320 490,891 24,971\n\nTotal Deportations\n\nDOCUMENTATION \u2013 TOTAL DEPORTEES\n\nUndocumented 94% PoR holder ** 6% This section only applies to PoR holders and undocumented Afghans.\n\nTOTAL RETURNS AND % DEPORTATIONS | 15 SEPTEMBER 2023 \u2013 27 JULY 2024 2023 2024\n\n*The number refers to facilitated PoR returns through VRCs who crossed the border during the reporting period. ** This figure refers to PoR holders based on interviews conducted with returnees in Afghanistan.\n---\n1 AUGUST 2024\n\nUNHCR-IOM FLASH UPDATE #25\n\nARREST AND DETENTION FLOW MONITORING (15 September 2023 \u2013 27 July 2024) This section only applies to ACC holders and undocumented Afghans This section only applies to PoR holders TYPE OF VULNERABILITY TYPE OF VULNERABILITY (Expressed as a percentage of the total numbers of vulnerable persons) (Expressed as a percentage of the total numbers of vulnerable persons) (7,974) 39% (6,399) 31% (2,007) 10% (1,014) 41% (438) 18% (253) 10% Elderly Elderly Serious Medical Persons with Serious Medical Women at (60+) Conditions (60+) Risk Conditions Disabilities (PwD)\n\n(1,663) 8% (794) 4% Female Pregnant Widows Women AGE AND GENDER Female Male 49.7% 50.3% 211,783 214,003 (10.5%) 44,546 0 \u2013 4 42,585 (10.0%) (18.7%) 79,556 5 \u2013 17 85,726 (20.1%) (19.1%) 81,550 18 \u2013 59 79,134 (18.6%) (1.4%) 6,131 60+ 6,558 (1.6%) REASONS FOR LEAVING PAKISTAN (TOP 5) (Multiple answers can exceed 100%, N = 25,641) Fear of arrest Loss of livelihood Communal pressure Unable to pay utilities Unable to pay house rent\n\n(1,713) 8% Other 89% 19% 13% 6% 6%\n\n(252) 10% (496) 21% Persons with Other Disabilities (PwD) AGE AND GENDER Female Male 49.0% 51.0% 20,582 21,453 (9.4%) 3,918 0 \u2013 4 3,707 (8.8%) (19.5%) 8,198 5 \u2013 17 8,527 (20.3%) (19.1%) 8,032 18 \u2013 59 8,505 (20.2%) (1.0%) 434 60+ 714 (1.7%) REASONS FOR LEAVING PAKISTAN (TOP 5) (Multiple answers can exceed 100%, N = 3,540) Socio-economic challenges Strict border entry requirement No added protection value of PoR card Uncertainty related to the PoR card extension Other\n\n33% 19% 12% 11% 25%\n\nDISTRICT OF ORIGIN IN PAKISTAN AND PROVINCE OF DESTINATION IN AFGHANISTAN\n\nDISTRICT OF ORIGIN (TOP 5) 1.

The BYC is a prominent civil rights movement advocating for the protection of civil, political, and economic rights, and calling for an end to enforced disappearances and custodial killings of Baloch in Balochistan.\nOn July 27, the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force in Pakistan, opened fire on buses heading to Gwadar for the Baloch National Gathering, injuring at least 14 people in Mastung, about 60 km (35 miles) west of Quetta. The authorities set up blockades across the province to restrict movement, leading to further violence.\nThe crackdown intensified on July 28, with security forces killing at least three protesters in Gwadar and injuring dozens more. On July 29, police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators, with reports of security forces firing on protesters on the outskirts of Gwadar on July 30.\nSince July 27, the Balochistan government has blocked roads and highways and cut off internet access, isolating Gwadar \u2013 a city once hailed for its potential as an emerging port similar to Dubai. Now, it stands as a bone of contention between ethnic Baloch, the federal government of Pakistan, and Beijing.\nIn this impoverished, dusty coastal town, which serves as a hub for the much discussed China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, China has invested a considerable amount in infrastructure and development, bringing the town into the limelight. Still, the indigenous residents of Gwadar and ethnic Baloch complain that their resources are being plundered with little benefit to them.\nThe Baloch have engaged in peaceful political activism against both Islamabad and China, while insurgents have also targeted Chinese interests with violent attacks. The ongoing unrest casts a shadow over the town\u2019s future and raises concerns about its stability and the viability of Chinese investment.\nIn recent years, China has faced significant security challenges in Pakistan, with Baloch nationalist insurgents in Balochistan and Islamist militants in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently attacking Chinese workers. The general public also appears increasingly unhappy with Chinese investment. Since 2021, Gwadar has seen multiple large-scale protests, with residents voicing grievances about being deprived of basic civic rights and necessities of life, despite the launch of CPEC almost a decade ago.\nDespite promises and grand claims that Gwadar would transform into a city akin to Shenzhen, Singapore, or Dubai, the reality remains starkly different. Today, Gwadar is still heavily dependent on neighboring Iran for electricity, while its nearly 100,000 residents rely on natural sources such as rain and traditional dams for water.\nIn recent months, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee has emerged as a harsh critic of Chinese investment in Gwadar. The BYC is an influential and popular group in Balochistan, largely due to its peaceful struggle for Baloch rights. It vocally addresses human rights issues plaguing Balochistan, especially enforced disappearances, custodial killings, and the exploitation of Balochistan\u2019s resources. The BYC\u2019s agenda resonates deeply with the Baloch public, which is why the group has earned considerable trust in Balochistan in a remarkably short time.\nThe BYC\u2019s main demand is an end to enforced disappearances in Balochistan, which the group\u2019s leadership rightly calls illegal and unconstitutional. The BYC leadership has repeatedly emphasized that people suspected of unlawful activities should face due process in a court of law under the constitution of Pakistan instead of being disappeared or killed.\nThe Balochistan government\u2019s violent response to peaceful protesters last week not only violated articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which guarantee freedom of movement and the right to assemble peacefully, but also represents a failure on the government\u2019s part to engage with one of the most popular peaceful rights movements in Balochistan.\nBalochistan has been hard hit by a violent separatist insurgency for the last two decades, the longest and most violent episode in the region\u2019s history compared to the previous four insurgencies. The economic and social reforms undertaken in the early 1970s by Pakistan\u2019s former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto should have served as a roadmap for containing the current insurgency in Balochistan. Instead, Pakistani rulers have embarked on even more political adventures, including forcefully disappearing political activists, banning political parties, and cracking down on peaceful rights movements.\nIn recent times, a popular peaceful rights movement in the form of the BYC has gained the trust and attention of not only the Baloch population \u2013 from Balochistan to Karachi and Dera Ghazi Khan in southern Punjab, where a huge population of Baloch lives \u2013 but also other political stakeholders in Balochistan, regardless of their stance on Pakistan\u2019s parliamentary politics. Both hardline nationalists who reject Pakistan\u2019s parliamentary politics and political parties in Balochistan deeply respect the BYC because of its considerable public support. However, the state\u2019s attitude toward the BYC seems hostile.\nBYC is highly regarded by the masses because it speaks about their genuine issues, particularly enforced disappearances that have plagued Balochistan for two decades. The failure of various governments to resolve these issues has deepened mistrust between the center and Baloch youth. This erosion of confidence in Baloch parliamentary parties has led the public to support alternate voices like the BYC, which has refrained from participating in elections or joining assemblies in Pakistan.\nDespite this, the BYC has been attempting to find solutions within the framework of the constitution of Pakistan. For this reason, the group organized a month-long sit-in in Islamabad from December to January, where they were also mistreated. The abuse of Baloch women and elders by Islamabad police conveyed a disappointing and negative message, and likely served as motivation for later violent attacks in Balochistan.\nAnother reason the BYC has gained public trust, especially among young Baloch women, is its indirect fight against patriarchy and gender inequality, which are deeply rooted in Baloch society. For the first time, a peaceful rights movement is led by young women, who make up the majority of BYC supporters. These young women have challenged the cultural status quo and outdated traditions, as well as the power corridors in Pakistan. They have inspired ordinary Baloch by removing the fear that has long held them back.\nMovements like the BYC are rare in the region, particularly because women are at the forefront. Many of these young women are driven by personal victimization; for instance, BYC organizer Dr. Mahrang Baloch, a general surgeon, lost her father to enforced disappearance. Her personal experience and commitment to the cause resonate deeply with ordinary Baloch.\nEngaging leaders like Mahrang Baloch and having a political dialogue with the BYC represented a crucial opportunity for Pakistan\u2019s political and military leadership, which has long dreamed of talking to Baloch nationalists to find a solution to Balochistan\u2019s conundrum. However, due to a lack of political seriousness in Balochistan, this opportunity has been nearly missed.\nThe provincial government of Balochistan likely missed this chance deliberately, as the current government representatives in Balochistan do not believe in political dialogue. Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, a staunch supporter of the powerful military and Pakistan\u2019s former caretaker interior minister just before the elections, was brought into power through what many see as hijacked elections. This process was widely viewed as a violation of democratic principles and Pakistan\u2019s election rules. His and his administration\u2019s reliance on violence to address public grievances and maintain power has led some to describe them as artificial leaders, having used coercion rather than democratic processes to secure their positions.\nThe state\u2019s harsh treatment of the BYC last week has only reinforced the narrative that peaceful activism has no place in Balochistan. This will ultimately benefit the Baloch separatist insurgents, who have long said that peaceful activism is futile in Pakistan. By using force against a peaceful movement with large public support, the Pakistani government risks driving more Baloch youth toward a violent insurgency.\nThis will, over the years, create greater challenges not only for Islamabad in tackling Balochistan\u2019s two-decade-long insurgency and finding a solution to the province\u2019s issues but also for China in investing in Balochistan, especially in Gwadar.", "78317": "title: KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA DAILY SITUATION REPORT \n content: PDMA PROVINCIAL DISASTER MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY Provincial Emergency Operation Center Plot 46 A, Sector

Most significantly, though, it offers recommendations for the transfer value for daily wages. Since the economic context is always changing, the transfer value will be regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains relevant. Additionally, by utilizing this document, the sector hopes to guarantee consistency throughout the various interventions, addressing potential conflicts that may emerge from partners\u2019 employing different strategies and offering different conditions, especially the transfer value.\n\nWhat is Cash for Work\n\n\"Cash for Work\" (CfW) is a program where participants receive cash payments in exchange for performing specific types of work. This approach is often used in humanitarian and development contexts to provide immediate income support to individuals or households, while also contributing to community infrastructure and development projects. CfW programs create temporary income generation opportunities for people, especially in regions with high unemployment rates or during times of economic downturns. Furthermore, the work performed under CfW programs often involves projects that benefit the community, such as repairing roads, building schools, improving water and sanitation facilities, or cleaning up public spaces. These projects can enhance local infrastructure and services. Lastly, participants in CfW programs may acquire new skills or improve existing ones, which can enhance their employability in the future. Training and capacity-building components are sometimes included in these programs.\n\nCash for work in Lebanon\n\nFollowing the economic crisis in Lebanon in 2019, the Livelihoods sector and its partners significantly expanded labor-intensive programming to provide Cash for Work (CfW) opportunities to the most vulnerable community members. This initiative aimed to address the immediate needs of those severely impacted by the crisis, such as low-income families, refugees, women, youth, and people with disabilities. By offering temporary employment, CfW programs provided essential cash payments, helping participants meet their basic needs like food, rent, and healthcare. Simultaneously, these programs focused on community development projects, such as repairing infrastructure and improving public services, which not only created jobs but also enhanced local living conditions, especially in the context where local authorities lost their ability to provide these services.\n\nDaily workers (Cash for Work) in the Lebanese Labor Law\n\nArticle 7 of the Labor Code states that: Domestic servants employed in private houses; agricultural syndicates which have no relations with commerce and industry and which shall be the object of a special legislation; establishments in which only members of the family are employed under the direction of the father, the mother or the guardian; governmental administrations and municipalities as concerns employees, laborers by the day and casual workers who are excluded from the civil servants regulations, and who shall be the object of a special legislation.i As such the Labour Code does not cover domestic workers, agricultural workers, family businesses, government or municipal workers, day laborers or casual workers.\n---\nIn terms of work permits, there is a debate on whether displaced Syrians are required to hold a work permit to be engaged in cash for work activities. This comes from several factors: - The cash for work duration normally extends over 40 days which does not constitute fixed or long-term employment. - The sectors in which cash for work activities are implemented are those identified by the Government of Lebanon as allowed sectors (agriculture, construction, and environment- cleaning) joined with a lack of clear text requiring work permits in these sectors. - The administrative challenges in relation to sponsorship especially given the usually high number of beneficiaries, inability of both implementing organizations or contractors (in case available) to assume this role, and the time needed to obtain these permits which might exceed the initial activity timeframe.\n\nDuration of activities\n\nThe average number of workdays for each cash for work activity beneficiary is 40 days, 7-8 hours per day. This recommendation comes from the understanding of the labor law that reaching three months on a \u201cjob\u201d entail that it is a fixed employment. However, some partners extended this duration to reach 60 days. As such, to have a meaningful intervention, the partners can apply a minimum of 40 days and a maximum of 60 days per round.\n\nTransfer value To identify and ensure a fair and meaningful transfer value, the sector considered two different variables:\n\nThe Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB): a metric used to estimate the minimum cost of necessities that a household needs to survive. This typically includes essential items like food, water, shelter, and basic hygiene products. The WFP Lebanon Situation Reportii which regularly monitors and updates the SMEB in Lebanon, identified the monthly cost of the full Survival Minimum Expenditure Basket (SMEB) in March 2024 at LBP 36.5 million (USD 403) for a family of five which was an increase by 5 percent from February of the same year. The minimum wage: the lowest amount of compensation that employers are legally required to pay their workers for their labor, typically expressed as an hourly, daily, or monthly rate. It is established by law or by contract to ensure a basic standard of living for employees and to protect workers from exploitation and unfairly low pay. The specific rate of the minimum wage is determined by government legislation. In April 2024, the caretaker Minister of Labour announced an increase in the minimum wages in the private sector to become LBP 27 million (USD 298)1iii.\n\nAiming to align the financial needs of the workers with both the humanitarian standard and the legal labour standards, the average between the above-mentioned variables is used to identify the new cash- for-work daily wage at USD 16 inclusive of the transportation fees.\n\nLBP 18 million as basic salary and LBP 9 million as transportation fees\n---\n|    | 0            | 1             | 2           |\n|----|--------------|---------------|-------------|\n|  0 |              | Monthly (USD) | Daily (USD) |\n|  1 | SMEB         | 403           | 18          |\n|  2 | Minimum wage | 298           | 14          |\n|  3 | Average      | 351           | 16          |\n\nThe rationale and benefits from using this approach are: - Addressing basic need: the SMEB represents the minimum cost required for basic survival, thus incorporating it will ensure the wage meets the fundamental living cost for workers.\n\nThe legal compliance: minimum wage laws are established to protect workers from exploitation and ensure fair compensation for their work and is ma legally mandated basis that must be met, thus incorporating it ensures compliance with legal labour standards.\n\nOther considerations with possible financial implications: - To enhance women participation several recommendations, encourage the provision of childcare services. Two effective practices are recognized for integrating childcare services in CfW initiatives where women are involved. Firstly, designating one woman worker as a dedicated caregiver for children, remunerated through cash-for-work arrangements, ensures child-care provision during work activities. Secondly, allocating a budget specifically for childcare, ranging between USD 3,000 to 20,000 based on project locations, ensures sustained accessibility for women participants throughout the project duration. The childcare budget could be channelled to nurseries nearby, establishing a child-friendly space, or rehabilitating a close nursery. It is also worth noting that child-care is preferable to be close to the women\u2019s\n\nhousehold and not the project site, so women do not have to pay transportation for the child. - To enhance participation of people with disabilities, partners are recommended to provide specialized transportation or to pay an additional amount to cover specialized transportation that could be used by the person with disability. This additional amount can be determined on the actual cost that would be incurred by the beneficiary but not to exceed three dollars per working day.\n\nTransfer modalities\n\nThere are several modalities to conduct the cash transfer to the beneficiaries. The most common method is through financial services providers (FSP). The limitation of this approach is the requirement for documentation which might not be available to all beneficiaries.\n\nTransfers through FSPs incur fees that should be paid by the partners, or contractors/implementing partners to transfer money to allow beneficiaries to get full net amount of the daily wage.\n\nIn the cases where beneficiaries lack their identification documents a \u201cproxy\u201d who is a person identified by the beneficiary to act on his/her behalf. In the cases where a proxy is used, partners and beneficiaries should be aware of the protection risks resulting from this measure. This is of special importance with women, youth, and persons with disabilities. In such cases, partners are responsible for raising awareness of possible risks and conduct due diligence to ensure that beneficiaries are\n---\nwillingly taking this decision. A formal delegation request must be signed by the beneficiary to facilitate the access of the proxy to the payment. Exceptionally, partners can resort to cash in hand.\n\nPayments can be made on a monthly or bi-weekly basis, which can be decided depending on the vulnerability of the beneficiaries where the most vulnerable might be in need to cash more often. Bi- weekly payments, however, pose special considerations in the project budgets as transfer fees will be twice as much of the monthly payments.\n\nSafeguards (working conditions, insurance\u2026)\n\nLebanese laws and regulations do not provide for specific provisions regarding persons that work on an hourly, daily, or seasonal basis. Therefore, persons working on an occasional basis are in principle subject to the Labor Code unless they are among the occupations exempted under the Code, such as daily and casual workers.2 Due to the lack of specific provisions regarding this category of employees, their rights are calculated on a pro-rata basis (i.e., minimum wage, annual leave). They are also subject to the law of work accidents3iv.\n\nBelow is a selected list of main topics to consider. Partners can refer to the following guidance notes for further guidance: - Gender Mainstreaming in Livelihoods Here: provides guidance and recommendations to ensure women participation and inclusion in the sectors\u2019 different activities. - Recommended Parameters on Outreach Identification and Selection Here: provides recommendation on best practices to identify and select beneficiaries. - Main principles outlined under the decent work component based on the ILO\u2019s EIIP Guidelines and safeguards Here\n\nDecent work principles\n\nDecent Work is at the core of implementation, entailing of opportunities for work that are productive and deliver a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for the workers and their families and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men. are as follows.\n\nOutreach To enhance social cohesion, and to avoid tension and discrimination in recruitment, the priority is a balance between the host and displaced community4, thus, a comprehensive outreach and communication strategy is crucial to alleviate any kind of tension that may result. Potential workers can also be identified by sharing information on upcoming (with location, type of activity, number of beneficiaries) with MoSA (through SDCs) and UNHCR (through CDCs) who would in turn forward information to appropriate target groups and individuals based on their vulnerability lists.\n\nLocal authorities and the targeted community must be oriented towards the project and workers. Information on work conditions and the specific requirement for security screening shall be made public\n\nArticle 7 of the Labor Code\n\nDecree Law No. 136 issued on 16 September 1983\n\n50/50 ratio\n---\nas early as possible. Employers must not discriminate between men and women with regards to type of work and wages or recruitment. Instead, employers should implement concrete measures to increase the participation of women and persons with disabilities. Communication campaigns targeting both displaced populations and vulnerable host community members prior to registration, are needed to attain maximum levels of transparency.\n\nWorking hours\n\nA normal working day should be eight hours, and in very exceptional cases, up to 12 hours (to be compensated and considered as the exception and not the rule). During the working day and after 6 consecutive working hours for men and 5 for women, workers are entitled to one hour break according to the Lebanese Labour Law. Additionally, one full day of uninterrupted rest per week should be provided for all workers.\n\nHealth and Safety Compliance with ILO\u2019s conventions and the Lebanese legislations is seen as a minimum requirement when it comes to Occupational Safety and Health (OSH). Employers shall provide safety induction training or briefing to all personnel upon starting on sites, comprehensive First Aid Kits and safe drinking water should be always present, no firearms, weapons, illegal substances, or alcoholic beverages on site to be present, Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) should be provided to all. Employers must cover the cost of treatment when workers are injured by accident at the workplace and provide a valid insurance policy to cover work related incidents. It is important to mention that it is mandatory for all contractors to provide a safety plan and compliance to the same should be contractually binding.\n\nEffective Inclusion The CFW initiative should ensure that we are being inclusive to all segments of the community without leaving anyone behind (this includes men, women, Lebanese, Syrians and other nationalities) with a cross-cutting target for Persons with Disabilities across all groups.\n\nThe project should have an equal-opportunity approach for women and Persons with Disabilities, to be engaged either in labour-intensive works or as contractors (company owner or staff), advocating with contractors for employment of persons with disabilities in the workforce.\n\nMinimum age The Lebanese Labour Law divides children into two categories, those below 14 and those aged between 14 and 18. However, the Lebanese Labour Law prevents children under 16 years of age from working in harmful circumstances for certain types of work or activities which are deemed harmful or detrimental, and no child should be employed for more than 6 hours/day.\n\nContracts\n\nAll beneficiaries who enter a working arrangement with the project must sign an employment contract which will allow them to work on the project. Contracts should outline the rights and obligations of the workers in a language understood by them (usually Arabic); for workers that do not read and write the contract is read to them in detail.\n---\nAll contracts must be submitted to the organization with a copy of the worker\u2019s identification documents and can only be accepted if the sanction list screening process5 has been performed by the contractor through the financial service provider paying out the wages. It is the contractors\u2019 responsibility to validate that Identification documents are valid prior to recruiting any worker given that payments are processed through a third-party financial institution and payments cannot be made except upon valid identification documents.\n\nGrievance mechanism The complaint mechanism within the project should be an integral part of the programme to give the opportunity for direct and indirect beneficiaries to voice their concerns anonymously and in full\n\nconfidence. It is the role of the organization to mobilize this mechanism, ensure the confidentiality of all complaints and address those relevant as soon as possible. It is important to mention that all those who submit a complaint are protected against any type of retaliation. Female workers/beneficiaries/stakeholders are given the option to speak with a female officer or team member.\n\nPrevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Support\n\nFurthermore, enhanced training and capacity building should be provided to all team members, especially those present on site to receive and refer cases relevant to PSEA. This will entail close linkages with specialized units and different partner organizations that have the capacity and needed resources to address such cases in a safe and prompt manner.\n\ni https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/guidelines/guide-to-employment-rights/lebanon-employment-rights- guide---english.pdf ii https://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/wfp-lebanon-situation-report-april-2024 iii http://www.pcm.gov.lb/archive/j2024/j16/wfm/m13164.htm iv Ibid\n\n5Prior to recruitment of any potential participants that fit the socio-economic criteria of vulnerability, the responsible partner should check the names of potential participants and verify their names against international sanctions lists, including the EU and the UN sanctions list (https://scsanctions.un.org/search/ (make sure to press reset after each entry); https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/) If the potential participants\u2019 names are cleared, the responsible partner can recruit the potential participants.", "83947": "title: SNHR Submits A Report for the UN Human Rights Committee\u2019s 141st Session \n content: The Syrian Regime Has Violated the ICCPR, With Many of Its Violations Constituting Crimes Against Humanity\n\nWednesday 31 July 2024\n\nThe Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), founded in June 2011, is a non-governmental, independent group that is considered a primary source for the OHCHR on all death toll-related analyzes in Syria.\n---\nContents:\n\nI.

SNHR Submits a Report to the UN Human Rights Committee and Participates in Formal and Informal Briefing Sessions\n\nSNHR has worked for over 13 years to date on documenting the various violations taking place across Syria. SNHR archives and catalogues these violations in a private database. Thanks to our daily and accumulated documentation efforts over the years, SNHR feels confident that we can expertly evaluate the Syrian regime\u2019s violations of international hu- man rights law and customary international law, as well as other international instruments and treaties.\n\nThe Syrian regime\u2019s government recently submitted a report to the UN Human Rights Committee that reflects its supposedly great commitment to the ICCPR. Upon review- ing the report, SNHR has submitted an alternative report refuting much of the content of the regime\u2019s report. The SNHR report examines the degree to which the Syrian Arab Republic has complied with the ICCPR\u2019s articles, including its international obligations to ensure the most prominent human rights, with these observations drawing upon the data gathered throughout our years of monitoring and documentation. The report fo- cuses specifically on various types of violations committed by the Syrian regime over the last four years (from August 2020 until June 2024), which are related to Articles 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, and 26 of the ICCPR. In the report, SNHR clearly illustrates how Syria has reached rock bottom in respect to many fundamental human rights, becoming one of the world\u2019s worst countries in terms of committing various types of violations. With the Syrian regime3 led by Bashar Assad remaining in power, we\u2019ve documented the commission of many crimes of killing, arrest, enforced disappearance, torture, and restriction of freedoms by regime forces, especially by the regime\u2019s securi- ty apparatus, with many of these violations amounting to crimes against humanity. The report also proves that the Syrian regime has violated many ICPPR articles, as well as routinely breaching human rights.\n\n2. 3.\n\nSee: UN Human Rights Committee. (2021, December 29). State Party Report: Fourth Periodic Report Submitted by the Syrian Arab Republic Under Article 40 of the Covenant. https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/15/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CCPR%2F- C%2FSYR%2F4&Lang=en\n\nWe generally use the term \u2018the Syrian regime\u2019 rather than \u2018the Syrian government\u2019, because the nature of the ruling power in Syria is that of a totalitarian dictatorship where power is concentrated in the hands of a small circle of individuals, namely the President of the Republic and the heads of the regime\u2019s security apparatus. As a result, the ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Interior, play a restricted, largely ceremonial role, which is limited to implementing precisely what the ruling regime orders, with no real decision-making power or active role of their own. Syria is under autocratic/hereditary family rule, with no independent decision-making structure. Rather, the government is an empty fa\u00e7ade created merely for show. The Minister of Interior receives orders from the security branches over which he supposedly presides. The Minister of Justice cannot even summon a low-ranking security office, let alone a security branch head. Syria is ruled by the president assisted by the heads of the security branches.\n\nWhile we are aware that the United Nations and its agencies use the term \u2018the Syrian government\u2019, we believe that this is a completely inaccurate and misleading term in the Syrian context.\n---\nOn July 10, 2024, SNHR took part in the informal briefing session that preceded the of- ficial consideration session for the Syrian Arab Republic. In the informal session, SNHR answered questions and inquiries from members of the UN Human Rights Commit- tee. In the next two days, July 11-12, the formal sessions discussing Syria\u2019s compliance with the ICCPR were held, during which the report submitted by the Syrian regime on its compliance with the ICCPR was considered. SNHR has also taken part in a formal briefing session by submitting a video package summarizing the SNHR report, including recommendations to the Committee, as part of the agenda of the UN Human Rights Committee\u2019s 141st Session. It should be noted that SNHR previously submitted a report to the UN Human Rights Committee prior to the committee officially approving the list of issues related to the Syrian Arab Republic during its 130th session, which was held in the last quarter of 2020.4\n\nThe report, which was submitted by SNHR in early-June 2024, draws upon the informa- tion archived on the group\u2019s database, mainly focusing on the rights to life and to liberty and security of person, as well as the violations related to arrests; unlawful detentions; enforced disappearance, torture and inhumane punishments and treatment; freedom of opinion, expression, and peaceful assembly; freedom to hold political views, and the freedom to form political parties, and freedom to participate in free elections, in addi- tion to violations related to the issue of refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the freedom to movement. The report provides figures on these violations docu- mented during the period between August 2020 and June 2024. The report also sheds light, whenever appropriate, on the contexts governing many of violations. Meanwhile, the report highlights certain incidents as a qualitative sample that illustrates the meth- odology and deliberate commission of a certain violation, in order to ensure the report is of a manageable length.\n\nAdditionally, the report provides a summary of Syria\u2019s legal and constitutional frame- work, and of the scope of Syria\u2019s commitment under international human rights treaties, stressing that none of the current international human rights conventions and instru- ments ratified by Syria had any tangible effect on the formulation of the 2012 Consti- tution, or of any domestic laws and legislative articles. Indeed, as the report notes, the current constitution blatantly contravenes the most fundamental human rights. For one\n\n4.\n\nSyrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR). (2020).

Furthermore, the Syrian regime, which maintains complete and absolute hegemony over the People\u2019s Assembly of Syria, i.e., the country\u2019s legislative authority, exercised through the Baath Party,5 has promulgated dozens of laws that blatantly violate the fundamental rights of Syrian citi- zens, including those established in the ICCPR. The report outlines some of those rights.\n\nThe report emphasizes that the Syrian regime has practiced torture in a widespread and systematic manner. These torture practices have led to related outrages as severe as the loss of life, constituting blatant violations of international human rights law. It has also been well-established that the Syrian regime is fully aware of these practices, and of the fact that the inhumane detention conditions maintained in its prisons will eventually lead to death. Furthermore, the conscious decisions to carry out these practices have been issued from the very pinnacle of the regime\u2019s power hierarchy, starting with the Pres- ident of the Republic, who directly controls the ministries of interior and defense, the National Security Bureau, and their various subsidiary security agencies and security and military committees. The report adds that there are no legal grounds for convicting de- tainees and leveling charges against them, whether on the basis of the Counterterrorism Law or the Public Penal Code, with rulings usually being based on confessions extracted under torture and coercion. These are not genuine courts in any recognized legal and judicial sense.\n\nThe report further stresses that the legislative process in Syria has been stripped of all standards regulating legislation, especially those related to the conflict. This process has also contravened constitutional and legal articles in many of the articles of legisla- tion that have been promulgated. The legislative authority, i.e., the People\u2019s Assembly of Syria, lacks any autonomy and is completely subservient to the executive branch in every way, from appointing its members to controlling the laws passed by it. Meanwhile, the Syrian regime has eroded the state judiciary\u2019s authority, placing it under its own full control. In effect, there is today only one ruling authority, namely the executive authority, which is in the hands of the head of the republic and the security agencies that report to him. The Syrian regime is a bona fide dictatorial, totalitarian regime which explicitly and blatantly violates the principle of the separation of powers.\n\n5.\n\nSyrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR). (2020, August 14). Holding People\u2019s Assembly Elections before Reaching a Political Agree- ment Is Illegitimate and Undermines the Peace Process. https://snhr.org/?p=55359\n---\nThe report provides a number of recommendations; chief among these is that, at the very minimum, pressure must be applied on the Syrian regime to ensure that interna- tional observers, including the Independent International Commission of Inquiry (COI), are given unconditional and unrestricted access to detention centers. Also, the political transition process must be supported, and pressure must be imposed in order to to compel the parties to implement the political transition within a period of no more than six months so that most of the violations end and millions of displaced people can safely return to their homes. The report also calls for preventing any forcible return of Syrian refugees, since the situation in Syria continues to be unsafe, adding that instead pres- sure should be imposed to achieve a political transition that would ensure the automatic return of millions of refugees.\n\nIn addition, the report recommends acting more urgently in regard to bringing about a political resolution that would enable the Syrian people to hold free and fair political, parliamentary, and local elections that respect the rules of the electoral process.\n\nThe report also calls for condemning the laws passed by the Syrian regime that violate the rights of millions of Syrian people, and which are being enforced under the threat of arms and authority, and asserts that punitive measures must be adopted against the Syrian regime in order to deter it from killing any more Syrian citizens under torture.\n\nMoreover, the report recommends that the UN Human Rights Committee give recom- mendations to the Syrian regime to allow human rights work in Syria, as well as allowing the establishment of human rights organizations, with no prosecution, harassment, or restriction against their work, as well as allowing party and union activism. The report fur- ther states that the UN Human Rights Committee should also call on the Syrian regime to repeal all the so-called \u2018security laws\u2019 that massively crush freedom of opinion and ex- pression, and allow local, Arabic, and international media outlets to operate freely in Syr- ia with no restrictions or preconditions. In addition, the report also calls on the regime to completely cease its restrictions and direct threats against journalistic institutions and their workers, and to allow the establishment of dissenting media outlets while ensuring freedom of work and movement for their staff, instead of perverting vital institutions such as media into propaganda instruments which exist solely to serve the regime\u2019s agenda, justify the violations committed by its forces and militias, and distort the truth.\n\n6.\n\nSee: People\u2019s Assembly of Syria, Legislative Decree No. 32 of 2023 http://www.parliament.gov.sy/arabic/index.php?node=201&nid=23616\n---\nIII. SNHR Welcomes the Recommendations Made by the UN Human Rights Committee and Some Comments on the Report\u2019s Closing Observations\n\nOn July 25, the UN Human Rights Committee publicized its findings on the Syrian Arab Republic. In the closing observations, the Committee expressed its concern for the con- tinued arbitrary deprivation of life and the human rights violations taking place in the context of the armed conflict in Syria. Moreover, the Committee mentioned systematic violations that are being perpetrated in regime-held areas; including torture, arrests, sex- ual violence, and enforced disappearance. The UN Human Rights Committee urged the Syrian Arab Republic to intensify efforts to \u201cprotect the right to life, and to give effect to the rights to truth, justice and full reparation of victims of the armed conflict. The Com- mittee specifically asked [the Syrian regime\u2019s government] to conduct prompt, thorough, and independent investigations into all alleged human rights violations against civilians committed during the ongoing armed conflict, bring perpetrators to justice, and provide full reparation to victims or family members.\u201d\n\nThe Committee has also pinpointed a pattern of enforced disappearance cases since the start of the conflict, with the majority of those cases \u201callegedly attributable to gov- ernment forces.\u201d The Committee also expressed concern over the fact that there are no official records of disappeared people or judicial procedures put in place to address these violations. In this context, the Committee urged the Syrian regime\u2019s government to adopt urgent measures in order to \u201caddress and prevent enforced disappearances, par- ticularly to revise its legal framework to ensure that all forms of enforced disappearance are clearly defined in criminal law.\u201d In addition, The Committee called for fighting impu- nity in Syria and ensure that all perpetrators, once found guilty, face justice according to the gravity of these offenses.\n\nAdditionally, the UN Human Rights Committee has called on the regime to reveal the fate and whereabouts of disappeared persons, and in cases of deaths, identify them and return their remains, as well as ensure that families are regularly informed of the progress and findings of investigations, provided with the official administrative documents as dictated by international standards, and receive full reparations, including rehabilitation, adequate compensation, and non-repetition guarantees. Moreover, the Committee called on the Syrian regime\u2019s government to fully cooperate with the UN Independent Institu- tion on Missing Persons in Syria, and consider ratifying the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.\n---\nWhile the Committee welcomed the promulgation of Act No. 16 of 2022 on the Criminali- zation of Torture, it has recognized, and expressed concerns over, the widespread torture practice and ill-treatment, which at times lead to death, still rampant in regime deten- tion centers. The Committee underlined that \u201cAct No. 16 of 2022 lacks clear investigative mechanisms and an independent mechanism for the oversight and enforcement of the law and its implementation and does not guarantee redress for former victims of torture due to the absence of retroactive application provisions.\u201d The Committee also expressed concerns over \u201clegislative provisions which could possibly provide immunities for em- ployees of the State Security Department for crimes committed whilst carrying out their duties.\u201d In this context, the Committee urged the Syrian regime to take immediate action to end torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment, including re- viewing its legislative framework, such as Act No. 16 of 2022, in order to ensure it is fully compliant with the provisions of the ICCPR.\n\nMeanwhile, the Committee welcomed a number of measures taken by the Syrian regime, including the adoption of Legislative Decree No. 32 of 2023, which dissolves Military Field Courts. However, an important distinction must be made here; Legislative Decree No. 32, promulgated by the Syrian regime on September 3, 2023, actually mandates the cessation of Legislative Decree No. 109, dated August 17, 1968, and its amendments, which established Military Field Courts. All cases previously handled by these military courts are to be transferred to military judiciary to be prosecuted according to Syrian Penal Code and Military Procedural Law, issued by Legislative Decree No. 61 of 1950 and its amendments. According to numerous indicators identified by SNHR, the Syrian regime ended the operations of the Military Field Court after it had completed most of the cases it was examining, especially those related to individuals referred to it due to political opin- ions and the conflict. The Court had issued numerous judgments against them, including death sentences. We have documented that the Syrian regime carried out executions a few months before the promulgation of Decree No. 32 of 2023. Moreover, the transfer of cases that were being examined by the field court to the military judiciary is considered a formal procedure, as security agencies still have the authority to detain, investigate, and charge detainees, and determine which court they will be referred to: the military judi- ciary, the Counterterrorism Court, or civilian criminal judiciary. Furthermore, the military judiciary is under the Ministry of Defense, which previously controlled the Military Field Court, making it a non-independent judiciary, where the Minister of Defense has broad powers. The military judiciary is similar exceptional courts, and the sentences it issues do not differ much from those of the Military Field Court, especially since most judges who served in the military field court have been reappointed in the military judiciary. On top of that, the effects of the rulings issued by the military field court remain in effect, such\n---\nas the enforced disappearance of those referred to it and the confiscation of properties, among other rulings. Therefore, this step is merely a nominal and formal procedure that does not have a real impact on detainees and forcibly disappeared persons. On Septem- ber 12, 2023, SNHR issued a report entitled, \u2018An Instrument of Death and Disappearance: How the Syrian Regime Uses Military Field Courts Against Activists and Dissidents\u2019 in which we documented that the Syrian regime executed 7,872 individuals, including 114 children and 26 women, out of at least 14,843 death sentences documented by SNHR as being issued by Military Field Courts. Moreover, at least 24,047 individuals, including 98 children and 39 women, of those referred to Military Field Courts since March 2011 have been forcibly disappeared and their fate remains unknown.\n\nThe Committee stated that, by no later than July 23, 2027, the State Party, namely the Syrian Arab Republic, is to provide information about the implementation of the recom- mendations made by the Committee on enforced disappearance, access to justice, and children rights. The Committee also specified that the State Party submits its next peri- odic report by July 23, 2030, which should include specific up-to-date information on the implementation of the recommendations made in the present concluding observations\n\nThe report submitted by the Syrian regime\u2019s government can be found on this link, while the report submitted by SNHR can be found on this link.\n---\ninfo@snhr.org www.snhr.org No justice without accountability \u00a9 Syrian Network For Human Rights (SNHR), July 2024", "84085": "title: Page 1 of 10 \n content: Page 1 of 10\n\nSubject:\n\nMOST IMMEDIATE / BY FAX F.2 (E)/2024-NDMA (MW/SITREP-32) Government of Pakistan Prime Minister\u2019s Office National Disaster Management Authority (HQ) Main Murree Road Near ITP Office, Islamabad Dated: 1 August 2024 NDMA - Monsoon 2024 Daily Situation Report No. 32\n\nNDMA Monsoon 2024 Daily Situation Report No 32, covering period from 1300 hours 31 July to 1300 hours 1 August 2024 is enclosed for information / necessary action,\n\nplease.\n\n(Hammad Sadiq Rana) (Director (Response) Tel No: 051-9030924 Fax No: 051-9030729\n\nTo: Cc: ID:\n\nFederal Ministries & Departments (Interior, Planning, Food Security & Research, National Health Services, Information & Broadcasting, Climate Change, Pakistan Railways, Communications, Energy & Water Resources, Finance, Information and Broadcasting (MOIB), Press Information Department (PID), Economic Affairs Division Chief Secretaries, Provincial Governments, GB and AJ&K Director Generals, PDMAs, GBDMA SDMA Director Generals, Rescue 1122 (Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, KP, GB & AJ&K) Director General, Climate Change and Coastal Development, Government of Sindh Director General, Sindh Coastal Development Authority, Karachi Director General, Balochistan Coastal Development Authority Chairman, National Highway Authority, Islamabad Inspector General, National Highways& Motorway Police, Islamabad Chairman, Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, Islamabad Chairman, Federal Flood Commission, Islamabad Chairman, Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation, Islamabad Managing Director, National Transmission & Dispatch Corporation, Lahore Principal Information Officer, Press Information Department, Islamabad Commissioner Islamabad Headquarters, Pakistan Maritime Security Agency, Karachi Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Joint Crises Management Cell, Joint Staff Headquarters, Chaklala Cantt Staff Duties Directorate (SD Coord), General Headquarters, Rawalpindi Military Operations Directorate (MO-4), General Headquarters, Rawalpindi Cantt Engineer Directorate (Arms Branch), General Headquarters, Rawalpindi Cantt ACNS (Operations), Naval Headquarters, Islamabad ACAS (Operations), Air Headquarters, Islamabad Headquarters, Frontier Works Organization (FWO), Rawalpindi GSO-1, Inter Services Public Relations, General Headquarters, Rawalpindi Cantt Directorate General, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Islamabad Headquarters, Pakistan Coast Guards, Karachi Divisional Superintendent, Pakistan Railways Karachi Secretary to Prime Minister, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Islamabad Secretary, Cabinet Division, Islamabad PRO, DD (ICT\n---\nPage 2 of 10 MONSOON 2024 DAILY SITUATION REPORT NO - 32 (PERIOD COVERED: 1300 HOURS 31 JULY 2024 TO 1300 HOURS 1 AUGUST 2024) 1.
