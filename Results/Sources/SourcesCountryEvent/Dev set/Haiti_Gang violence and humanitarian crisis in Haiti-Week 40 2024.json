In the capital city of Port-au-Prince, gangs are committing extreme acts of violence that are directly and indirectly affecting citizens. Many citizens have fled areas where gangs have taken over, leaving many displaced from their homes and in urgent need of humanitarian aid. The International Organization of Migration estimates that, in early 2024 alone, a record number of nearly 580,000 Haitians were internally displaced by the conflict.\nPrime Minister Garry Conille announced on August 29, 2024 that Haitian forces working with Kenyan police had launched a joint operation to oust criminal gangs from Bel Air, one of the roughest neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince. Kenyan police forces are a part of the multinational security support mission (MSS) that is working to secure public safety and protect critical infrastructure, including the airport and critical roads.\nThe United Nations Population Fund and the Center for Strategic and International Studies both report increasing levels of GBV. Risks were noted in 14 of the surveyed displacement sites, with more than half of the latrines and many showers not separated by gender, several showers with no locks, and many sites without nighttime lighting. Women and girls, in particular, have continued to be disproportionately impacted by the crisis in Haiti, with 2023 reporting by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) showing a 49% increase in GBV and pregnant women facing difficulties accessing essential maternal health services.\nThe United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti, reports that at least 1,379 people were killed or injured and another 428 were kidnapped between April 1 and June 30, 2024. These numbers represent a decrease in the number of killings, compared with the more than 2,500 killings reported in the first quarter of 2024, while the number of kidnappings has remained similar. The report also highlighted an increase in rape and other GBV in gang-controlled neighbourhoods and sites for internally displaced people (IDPs), with service providers reporting receiving an average of 40 rape survivors each day in areas of Port-au-Prince.\nChildren continue to be impacted by the violence and are increasingly targeted for recruitment by gangs.

Nearly half of the population (48 percent) are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis or worse conditions (IPC Phase 3 or above) between August 2024 and February 2025. This includes 6,000 people experiencing catastrophic levels of hunger and a collapse of their livelihoods, classified in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Another 2 million people (18 percent of the population analysed) are facing critical levels of acute food insecurity, classified as IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), while 3.4 million people face crisis levels of acute food insecurity, classified as IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). There is a 4 percent increase (1.2 million people) in the prevalence of populations in IPC Phase 3 or above compared to the previous analysis conducted for the same period in August 2023.\nThe escalation of violence in Gressier, Ganthier and Port-au-Prince is resulting in serious difficulties in supplying basic foodstuffs to the regions, limiting households\u2019 physical and financial access to food. Inflation remains high and food expenditure now accounts for up to 70 percent of total household expenditure. Farmers are also unable to sell their produce due to the blocking of various roads linking the metropolitan area to the regions. The Haitian people are still suffering from the residual effects of various climatic shocks such as the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the 2021 earthquake as well as periodic droughts. The rapidly declining economy is trending towards a fifth consecutive year of depression as the country experiences another year of negative growth in 2024 due to the tense security context.\nOf the 35 areas analyzed, 15 are now classified in Phase 4.

General Assembly on Thursday: \"I am convinced that this change of status, whilst recognizing that the errors of the past cannot be repeated, would guarantee the full success of the mission in Haiti.\"\nThe senior U.S. official said Washington would \"work with partners over the coming weeks to support that call.\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised the issue of transforming the security force into a U.N. peacekeeping operation during a visit to Haiti earlier this month.\nMany Haitians are wary of an armed U.N. presence after previous missions left behind a devastating cholera epidemic and sex abuse scandals.\nThe current Kenyan-led international security mission, while authorized by the U.N. Security Council, is not a United Nations operation. Countries voluntarily provide money and personnel.\nThe mission has made little progress toward helping Haiti restore order with only 400 Kenyan police officers on the ground so far and a shortfall in funding.\nU.N.

Some 300 violent criminal groups control nearly 80 percent of the metropolitan area of the capital Port-au-Prince and are increasingly active in the country\u2019s rural areas. They terrorize local residents \u2013 killing, raping, and kidnapping at will \u2013 and prevent the free movement of people and goods. The violence has forced schools and hospitals to close and has made daily survival a struggle for many. Nearly five million Haitians are acutely food insecure, including about 1.6 million people who are facing emergency levels of food insecurity, according to the UN.\nYet despite this dire situation, our recent visit to Haiti showed some glimmers of hope.\nThe new transitional prime minister, Garry Conille, who has a humanitarian background, has publicly pledged to prioritize the rule of law and combat corruption while respecting human rights. This is a welcome commitment in a country where traditional political actors and the economic elite have long backed the criminal groups, using them to access resources and win elections that have hardly been free or fair.\nConille\u2019s government recently finalized a \u201croadmap\u201d that incorporates many of the key recommendations Human Rights Watch and Haitian civil society groups have identified as being essential to effectively address the crisis.\nMeanwhile, the UN-authorized Multinational Security Support mission (MSS) led by Kenya, is finally operational. The mission will support the Haitian National Police in restoring basic security and state control and carries with it strong policies to monitor the force\u2019s conduct, ensure respect for human rights, and avoid the failures and abuses associated with past international interventions in Haiti.\nBut despite some good will and commitments, the government, the MSS, and humanitarian and human rights groups working in Haiti don\u2019t have anywhere near the resources needed to effectively address the challenges. The MSS only has 425 of the expected 2,500 personnel on the ground in Haiti and has only received around US$85 million through the UN-controlled Trust Fund, in addition to direct contributions \u2013 primarily $369 million from the United States \u2013 far below the estimated $600 million required annually for its operation.\nThe UN\u2019s humanitarian appeal for Haiti is only 35 percent funded and faces a $437.5 million gap. The transitional government will need significant resources to restore state control; ensure residents have access to basic necessities, such as food, health care, and education; rebuild the justice system; and implement programs to support survivors of sexual violence and vulnerable children in areas controlled by criminal groups. More international support and coordination is needed now.\nDisclaimer\n- Human Rights Watch\n- \u00a9 Copyright, Human Rights Watch - 350 Fifth Avenue, 34th Floor New York, NY 10118-3299 USA", "54139": "title: ACAPS Thematic Report - Haiti: Impact of conflict on children and youth (30 September 2024) \n content: OVERVIEW\nSince the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in July 2021, conflict in Haiti has intensified, and armed gangs have taken control of large parts of the country. The situation worsened in March 2024 when gangs attacked the country\u2019s two largest prisons, the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince (PAP) and the Croix-des-Bouquets civil prison, freeing over 4,000 inmates. In the same month, they also besieged the airport and forced Prime Minister Ariel Henry into exile (TNH 26/06/2024; ACLED 06/03/2024; InSight Crime 27/05/2024).\nThe escalating violence has aggravated the already dire conditions of poverty and political instability facing civilians. ACLED estimates that over 5.1 million people (around 56% of the population), including children, will continue to be exposed to violence throughout 2024 (ACLED 07/08/2024).\nThe area most affected by violence and insecurity is the capital city, the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (including communes in Carrefour, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Delmas, P\u00e9tion-Ville, PAP, and Tabarre), where the population has decreased significantly because of massive displacement towards other areas of the country (Flowminder Foundation 03/05/2024). In March 2024 alone, 300,000 people (more than 10% of its pre-March population of 2,980,000) left the city because of insecurity (MT accessed 16/09/2024; Mercy Corps 27/08/2024). Artibonite department is also among the most affected areas; between April\u2013June, at least 312 (73%) of the 428 reported kidnappings countrywide occurred in the department (BINUH 30/06/2024).\nWhile exact figures on the number of children affected by violence are not available, the recent developments in the country have significantly affected the protection, shelter, education, and physical and mental health needs of civilians, including children. Increased food insecurity and malnutrition, a cholera outbreak, and the current hurricane season compound this situation. In June 2024, nearly three million children (out of a total of 4.3 million children countrywide) were in urgent need of humanitarian aid (WCP accessed 20/09/2024; UNICEF 15/06/2023).\nKEY MESSAGES\n\u2022 The increasing conflict in Haiti poses severe protection risks for children, with an average of five children killed per week in the first half of 2024. They face violence from several perpetrators, including armed gangs and self-defence brigades (armed civilians aiming to protect people from these gangs) (AJ 28/03/2024; ICG 03/07/2023).\n\u2022 Children are at high risk of forced recruitment into armed gangs, sexual abuse, and other protection threats. Women and girls are at particularly high risk of gender-based violence (GBV), especially in IDP communities\n\u2022 Education access is limited because many schools are serving as IDP centres. At the same time, insecurity is preventing many children from going to school.\n\u2022 There is limited information on unaccompanied and separated children, but the increase in internal and cross-border displacement is separating children from their families.\n\u2022 Severe acute malnutrition among children increased by almost 20% between January\u2013 July 2024, with nearly 125,000 Haitian children facing severe acute malnutrition in July.\n\u2022 Increased malnutrition, violence, and poor WASH and health access, which has resulted in decreased vaccination rates, heighten children\u2019s vulnerability to injury and waterborne, vector-borne, gastrointestinal, and other diseases. Children have limited healthcare access, with 40% of inpatient facilities in PAP closed since May 2024 because of insecurity.", "58909": "title: Hundreds of miles from landfall, Hurricane Helene's 'apocalyptic' devastation unfolds \n content: Hundreds of miles from landfall, Hurricane Helene's 'apocalyptic' devastation unfolds\nThe storm killed at least 107 people and left dozens missing.\nThe death toll from Hurricane Helene is still climbing as Americans across the Southeast count the cost of last week's massive storm.\nAt least 107 people were killed as Helene traveled northwards from the Gulf Coast, The Associated Press reported Monday.

The number of IDPs in MAPAP has decreased (-6%) reflecting a continued outflow of people to provinces but at a lower volume compared to the period of March to April 2024.\n- The situation for displaced women and girls remains desperate as they struggle to secure even the most basic necessities. Current efforts to protect women and girls from violence in Haiti are not being delivered at the scale needed despite recent commitments from governments, UN agencies and NGOs to prioritize this crucial issue. Currently only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti receive protection services, including services for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV). Women and girls urgently need protection services, as well as access to reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation and hygiene.\n- Food insecurity, and the scarcity and costs of products at markets, is amplifying the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and increasing reliance on harmful coping mechanisms. Around 94 percent of women and girls are at risk of GBV and almost three-quarters (72 percent) of GBV incidents are sexual violence.\n- UNFPA and its implementing partners continue to provide sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services where access is possible and security allows. This includes deploying mobile teams to IDP sites to provide integrated SRH/GBV services; the provision of remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation and GBV information via a hotline; and awareness raising activities on GBV and SRH and available services. UNFPA continues to support the GBV coordination mechanism at the national level and in Artibonite, in close collaboration with the Ministry on the Status and Rights of Women.\nSituation Overview\n- Gang violence continues to drive displacement, including in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Ganthier and Bas-Delmas. More than 700,000 persons are internally displaced across the country. Women and girls are particularly affected by the crisis \u2013 the risks of sexual violence in displacement sites has risen, in part, due to the poor living conditions.\n- Criminal incidents, including armed robberies, burglaries and kidnappings, have recently increased in Haiti, particularly in MAPAP. Between January and end of August alone, more than 3,400 people were killed and 1,600 others injured in gang violence \u2014 with over 1,000 people kidnapped.\n- The Haitian government has renewed and extended a state of emergency to 19 September 2024 throughout the West Department and in all other communes where gangs are present, including Artibonite, the Central Plateau and Nippes.\n- Tensions between IDPs and host communities are more frequently reported in MAPAP than in provinces. Factors for tensions include a lack of resources, access to food, water and the high prices of products on the market since the arrival of IDPs. Access to land was also mentioned, especially in provinces.\n- Despite an improvement in the security situation, humanitarian access remains a challenge and is impacting service provision in areas where there are risks of attacks and abductions. Improving security conditions is the first factor reported by households who are considering returning home: 84% of households in IDP sites and 77% of households in host communities.\n- Although more than 5 million people, roughly half the population, are going hungry and hundreds of thousands have been displaced, a $674 humanitarian appeal for Haiti has received just over a third (36 percent) of the funding. UNFPA has only managed to mobilize 19% of its required funding.\n- The Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission to support the Haitian National Police continues. The force now numbers around 400 personnel -- with more than a dozen officers from Jamaica and Belize.", "65754": "title: One in Six Children in Haiti one step away from famine conditions - Save the Children \n content: PORT-AU-PRINCE 3 October 2024 \u2013 One in six children in Haiti are now one step away from famine-like conditions with the number at risk rising more than 20% in six months due to ongoing armed violence, according to Save the Children.\nAnalysis of new data from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Partnership\u2014the leading international authority on the severity of hunger crises\u2014found that about 2 million children\u2014almost half of all children in the country\u2014are facing crisis levels of hunger or worse.\nAmong them, more than 760,000 children, or one in six children\u2014are experiencing emergency food insecurity (IPC Phase 4), characterised by acute malnutrition and a heightened risk of hunger-related death.

Meanwhile, farmers are facing difficulties selling their crops due to roadblocks imposed by armed groups around Port-au-Prince, cutting off access to surrounding regions.\nArmed violence and a lack of available services and supplies are preventing Save the Children and other aid agencies from reaching many children and adults in need.\nChantal Sylvie Imbeault, Save the Children\u2019s Country Director in Haiti, said:\n\u201cThe heart-breaking reality in Haiti is that children are paying the ultimate price for a crisis fuelled by violence and instability. Armed groups are using hunger and hopelessness of children to recruit them into their ranks. As the hunger crisis tightens its grip on the country, the future of the current and future generations slips away.\n\u201cThe violence has created a chokehold on humanitarian aid, leaving us unable to reach the most vulnerable. Without immediate access to life-saving aid, we may risk losing an entire generation to preventable suffering and death. We\u2019re once again demanding unfettered access for aid workers and to urgently mobilise resources to save lives.\u201d\nSave the Children has been working in Haiti since 1978 in both urban and rural communities.\nThe child rights organisation is calling for full, unfettered access for aid workers and life-saving supplies across Haiti, especially in Port au Prince, to combat hunger and severe acute malnutrition and for all parties to do their utmost to protect children. Save the Children is also calling on the international community to urgently increase humanitarian funding for Haiti.\nSave the Children is providing cash assistance for displaced families in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince living in schools-turned-shelters to find more dignified housing solutions while helping to free up schools to resume educational activities, and cash assistance to host families in the Grand\u2019Anse and South department. The child rights organisation is also working through local partners in Haiti\u2019s West, Grand\u2019Anse and South departments to provide access to quality education and psychosocial support to students.\nENDS\nNotes to Editor:\n\u00b7 The IPC framework ranks global hunger crises on a scale from Stressed (Phase 2) to Catastrophic/Famine (Phase 5).\n\u00b7 According to the IPC, 2 million people (18 percent of the population analysed) are facing critical levels of acute food insecurity, classified as IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), one phase away from IPC 5 (Catastrophe/Famine). Of the 2 million people facing IPC Phase 4, 38% are estimated to be children, more than 760,000.\n\u00b7 The 21% increase is calculated on the basis of children in IPC4+ in the March 2024 IPC release and the latest release, published in September 2024. 91% of the Haitian population was analysed in the March report, compared to 100% of the population for this report, so some of the increase may be due to a slight increase in people analysed.", "68386": "title: Multinational police force for Haiti renewed for another year \n content: Multinational police force for Haiti renewed for another year\nBy Margaret Besheer September 30, 2024\nThe U.N.

Nearly half of the population (48 percent) are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis or worse conditions (IPC Phase 3 or above) between August 2024 and February 2025. This includes 6,000 people experiencing catastrophic levels of hunger and a collapse of their livelihoods, classified in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Another 2 million people (18 percent of the population analysed) are facing critical levels of acute food insecurity, classified as IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), while 3.4 million people face crisis levels of acute food insecurity, classified as IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). There is a 4 percent increase (1.2 million people) in the prevalence of populations in IPC Phase 3 or above compared to the previous analysis conducted for the same period in August 2023.\n\nThe escalation of violence in Gressier, Ganthier and Port-au-Prince is resulting in serious difficulties in supplying basic foodstuffs to the regions, limiting households\u2019 physical and financial access to food. Inflation remains high and food expenditure now accounts for up to 70 percent of total household expenditure. Farmers are also unable to sell their produce due to the blocking of various roads linking the metropolitan area to the regions. The Haitian people are still suffering from the residual effects of various climatic shocks such as the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the 2021 earthquake as well as periodic droughts. The rapidly declining economy is trending towards a fifth consecutive year of depression as the country experiences another year of negative growth in 2024 due to the tense security context.\n\nOf the 35 areas analyzed, 15 are now classified in Phase 4.

After relative stability in the second quarter of 2024, violence increased sharply in the third quarter. This trend will likely continue, affecting the supply chain and intensifying population displacement. Nearly 2 million people (17 percent of the population analysed) are projected to be in Phase 4, while 3.5 million are projected to be in Phase 3. In short, 49 percent of the population will need urgent action.\n\nKey Drivers\n\nArmed gang violence: Gang activity is disrupting the distribution of food supplies by blocking key transport routes and limiting market access, making it difficult for people to obtain essential goods.\n\nLimited access to food: Farmers are facing difficulties in selling local produce.\n\nEconomic shocks: The country is facing another year of negative growth in 2024 due to the tense security situation, leading to high inflation and rising food prices.\n\nClimatic shocks: Resiudal effects from Hurricane Matthew, the 2021 earthquake and periodic droughts.\n\n4 - Emergency 3 - Crisis\n\n5 - Famine 4 - Emergency\n\n4 - Emergency 3 - Crisis\n\n5 - Famine 4 - Emergency\n\nPublished on 30 September 2024\n\n> 25% of households meet 25-50% of caloric needs through assistance > 25% of households meet > 50% of caloric needs through assistance\n\nLinking emergency and\n\ngiven the strong influence\n\nAnalysis Partners CNSA, OBSERVATOIRES DEPARTEMENTAUX DE LA CNSA, MCFDF, MARNDR, DINEPA, PNCS, WFP, SAVE THE CHILDREN, FAO, OVDDHMO, MDE, ICKL, IHSI, ESUN, CARE, WHH, HI, MEF, MSPP/UCPNANu, CONCERN WORLDWIDE, AAH, FSS/HAITI, AVSI, GOAL, FAMV, Embassy of France, FewsNet.\n\nPublication date: 30 September 2024.

Due to political instability, gang violence and chronic shortages of electricity and medical supplies, the country's National Blood Transfusion Center (CNTS) and Blood Transfusion Stations (PTS) have come close to suspending their activities, putting thousands of lives at risk.\nThe blood transfusion sector, crucial to meeting the need for blood products for patients requiring urgent transfusions, has been particularly hard hit by these challenges. Shortages of essential inputs for transfusion-transmissible infection (TTI) screening threatened to prevent the CNTS from screening collected blood bags, an essential step in guaranteeing the safety of blood products for safe transfusions. The breakdown of the cold chain, due to insufficient mains power, has paralyzed several PTSs, notably those in Cap-Ha\u00eftien, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie and Jacmel. This has compromised the ability of these regions to provide safe blood to the population in a timely manner.\nA rapid, coordinated response from PAHO/WHO\nFaced with this alarming situation, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), has taken urgent measures to help maintain blood transfusion services in the country. Thanks to emergency funds provided by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), PAHO quickly placed orders for essential TTI screening inputs and reagents, enabling screening tests to continue at the CNTS. This intervention ensured the continued availability of safe blood products for the country.\nAt the same time, to compensate for the break in the cold chain, PAHO supported the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) by supplying batteries and inverters, enabling the installed Alternative Solar Energy System to get back into operation. \u201cThis support not only enabled the affected STPs to resume their activities, but also strengthened their resilience, given the chronic shortage of city power\u201d, adds Dr. Noel, Director of the National Blood Safety Program.\nOvercoming logistical challenges in a context of violence\nDelivering and distributing medical supplies in a country where gang violence regularly blocks roads and border crossings is a major challenge. In fact, the medical inputs first had to be transported using a humanitarian airlift set up in response to the closure of Port-au-Prince international airport, from where freight normally transits. Medical inputs, such as blood bags and reagents, are then safely distributed throughout the country, where the need for blood products is critical.\nA significant impact on public health\nThe combined efforts of PAHO/WHO and the MSPP were able to guarantee the supply of safe blood products and enable hospitals and health establishments to avoid a major health crisis linked to a shortage of blood, particularly in peripheral areas with difficult access.\nIn addition, PAHO worked alongside the National Blood Safety Program (PNST) to set up a campaign to raise awareness and promote voluntary blood donation. Mobile blood drives were organized to encourage the population to donate blood, thereby strengthening the country's blood product stock.\nVital support in a time of crisis\nAs Haiti continues to face multiple crises, PAHO/WHO's rapid response has been essential in maintaining vital blood transfusion services and ensuring patient safety.\n\u201cThe logistical, technical and financial support provided by PAHO has made it possible both to overcome obstacles linked to insecurity and the insufficient availability of city power, and to strengthen the resilience of the Haitian health system. However, the situation remains fragile, and challenges still persist in certain health departments, requiring ongoing support to guarantee the availability of blood products and prevent future service disruptions in this crucial sector\u201d, explains Dr Oscar Barreneche, PAHO/WHO Representative in Haiti.\nPAHO/WHO reaffirms its commitment to supporting Haiti in its efforts to overcome these challenges and ensure transfusion safety, thereby helping to save lives and strengthen the health system as a whole.", "73318": "title: Haiti: Increased internal displacement heightens food and health needs in the Grand Sud region (Anticipatory note 03 October 2024) \n content: OVERVIEW\nIn 2024, Haiti has seen a 60% increase in the number of displaced people, rising from 362,000 in March to 702,973 in September, primarily as a result of deteriorating security conditions in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Zone (ZMPAP). One-third of those displaced nationwide left their homes in the first half of the year, marking this as a period with one of the highest levels of displacement in Haiti\u2019s recent history. More than 90% of all displaced people originated from the Ouest department, particularly the ZMPAP, which accounted for 85% of the national total. These areas also experienced the highest violence-related incidents between 2023\u20132024 (IOM 09/06/2024; ACLED 07/08/2024; IOM accessed 27/09/2024).\nNearly half of those displaced (315,200) have sought refuge in the Grand Sud region, in the departments of Grande\u2019Anse, Nippes, Sud, and Sud-Est. The arrival of an increasing number of IDPs in these departments could increase pressure on already limited resources and services. In 2023, over one million people in the Grand Sud region required humanitarian assistance, including food, healthcare, and WASH services (IOM 22/09/2024; OCHA 17/04/2023; WFP 15/03/2024; STC 26/03/2024). The Grand Sud region was already sheltering over 116,000 IDPs \u2013 particularly in Sud (38,000) and Sud-Est (37,000) \u2013 by late 2023, mostly displaced from the ZMPAP as a result of violence in 2022\u20132023 (IOM 16/01/2024, and 09/06/2024; ACLED 07/08/2024; IOM/Shelter Cluster 10/10/2023).\nSud department has received the most IDPs in 2024 so far, with around 116,000 by September, a figure only surpassed by the displaced population in the ZMPAP. Despite this, however, there are no official IDP sites in Sud, forcing the displaced to stay with host communities, typically family members or acquaintances. Food shortages remain the main issue for host communities and the Grand Sud region in general (IOM 22/09/2024 and 09/06/2024).\nFood assistance is expected to be a priority need for IDPs and host communities. Over 1,050,000 people are already projected to face severe acute food insecurity in the Grand Sud region. With the growing population, more people in the region are likely to need food assistance. Agricultural production in 2024 has been below the seasonal average as a result of erratic rainfall and overall insecurity affecting access to land, the availability of seeds, and the cost of labour, among other effects. Since February 2024, gangs have also attacked trucks transporting food and blocked roads used to move products from farming areas or import zones to markets across the country, further affecting food availability (FEWS NET 13/09/2024 and 31/08/2024; FAO 10/9/2024; UN 22/04/2024).\nIn Grand Sud, the Grand\u2019Anse and Sud-Est departments have been hit hardest by rising household and transportation-related costs throughout 2024, putting host communities and the broader population at increased risk of food insecurity, as less locally produced and imported food is expected to reach the departments\u2019 local markets (WFP 27/06/2024 and 19/01/2024; FEWS NET 13/09/2024;\nWP 07/03/2024).\nThe already underfunded national healthcare system, which was further weakened by the insecurity crisis, is likely unable to cope with the high number of new arrivals. Anticipated above-average rainfall and temperature created by La Ni\u00f1a, expected mainly in eastern Haiti near the border with the Dominican Republic, could lead to a rise in waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever, requiring increased medical care for both displaced and host communities (WMO accessed 14/09/2024; IRI accessed 14/09/2024; CDC 01/05/2023; FEWS NET 14/06/2024; Lifewater 23/05/2019).\nAlthough violence against civilians has decreased in the ZMPAP in Mid-2024, as gangs appear to be consolidating their positions, renewed clashes remain a possibility. This could lead to further internal displacement, with more people fleeing the ZMPAP for Grand Sud, as seen in recent weeks in Delmas, where more than 2,000 people left their homes after gangs clashed in the Boston neighbourhood on 11 September (IOM 14/09/2024).

Security Council. The U.N. believes Haiti's gangs are armed largely by guns trafficked from the United States.\nBut Haiti's judicial system has been paralyzed for years. According to the U.N., no progress has been made in the cases of any mass killings committed since 2021, as well as several major massacres since 2017.\nPolice are alleged to have taken part in some massacres.

Many countries made formal pledges of money and troops, but so far only around 400 have arrived, mostly from Kenya.\n\"We call for increased international financial and logistical assistance\" to the mission, Al-Kheetan said, urging an urgent investigation and reparations for the victims, a call echoed by a spokesperson for U.N. chief Antonio Guterres.\nHaiti's prime minister warned last month that countries should urgently fulfill their pledges in order to contain the situation.\nThe U.N. estimated at the end of September that 3,661 people had been killed in the gang violence since January.\nHaiti's former government first requested international security support in 2022.\nCountries including the United States and the UK, which both hold territories in the Caribbean, have meanwhile continued to organize deportation flights back to Haiti, despite pleas not to do so by the United Nations.\nResponding to the \"limited\" results of the mission more than a year after it was formally approved, neighboring Dominican Republic said this week it would step up deportations of undocumented migrants to up to 10,000 per week.

Two million \u2026 is massive.\u201d\nVilleneuve told The Associated Press that she also was surprised that some of the 2 million people hit by hunger don't even live in places directly affected by gang violence.\nWhile much of the hunger is directly tied to gang violence, double-digit inflation also has limited what many Haitians can afford to buy, with food now representing 70% of total household expenditures.\nThe cost of a food basket increased more than 11% in the past year, with inflation hitting 30% in July.\nIn addition, parts of Haiti are still struggling to recover from the August 2021 earthquake, various drought episodes, and Hurricane Matthew, which struck Haiti as a Category 4 storm in 2016.\nGang violence, however, accounts for most of the hunger, with gangs controlling 80% of Port-au-Prince and the roads that lead to and from northern and southern Haiti, preventing farmers from delivering goods and nonprofits from delivering aid.\nFrom April to June, at least 1,379 people were reported killed or injured, and another 428 kidnapped. In addition, gang violence has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years.\nA U.N.-backed mission led by Kenya that began in late June and is aimed at quelling gang violence in Haiti has liberated some communities. But officials say much work remains to be done as the U.S., Haiti and others call for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to secure funding and personnel that the current mission lacks.\n\u201cHaiti continues to face a worsening humanitarian crisis, with alarming rates of armed gang violence disrupting daily life, forcing more people to flee their homes and levels of acute food insecurity to rise,\u201d the report stated.\nIn 2014, only 2% of Haiti's population was food insecure, a number that has soared to nearly 50%, according to Mercy Corps, one of several nonprofits that called for an increase in funding on Monday.\nDujarric said humanitarian food agencies and nonprofits in Haiti need an additional $230 million until year's end.\nSeventy percent of people living in makeshift shelters are experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, the report found.\nAmong those experiencing hunger is Joceline St-Louis, a 28-year-old mother of two boys, 5 and 1. \u201cFood doesn\u2019t come around very often,\u201d she said, adding that she depends on others to feed her children.\n\u201cWhen an organization does provide food, there\u2019s a major fight,\u201d she said.\nSt-Louis said she has to take her 1-year-old to a clinic so he can receive a peanut butter mix \u201cso that his body doesn\u2019t collapse in my arms.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sometimes so depressed that I sometimes want to kill the kids and myself,\u201d she said in a soft voice as she cradled the 1-year-old in her arms while the 5-year-old played with his friends.\nIn another shelter nearby, Judeline Auguste, 39, said she depends solely on remittances to feed herself and her 8-year-old boy, but the money barely lasts a week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that I can get a meal a day,\u201d she said. \u201cMy situation is hard not because of me, but because of my son. He looks at other people eating all the time, and he starts crying, \u2018Mommy, I\u2019m hungry.\u2019\u201d\nMeanwhile, those facing urgent levels of hunger live in Haiti\u2019s northern, central and southern regions, as well as in the capital.\nJean Yonel, who fled his home with his family after gangs raided their neighborhood, said there are days that he, his wife and their seven children eat only white rice or spaghetti.\n\u201cI can\u2019t provide every day for these children,\u201d Yonel said. \u201cSometimes we take just a spoonful of food and leave the rest of the food for the kids so they don\u2019t die.\u201d\nYonel used to work as a mason, but with construction jobs drying up, he is now forced to search for wood to make charcoal.

Without immediate action, the hunger crisis in Haiti will continue to deepen, with devastating consequences for millions of vulnerable people.\nAccording to the latest IPC analysis, 5.4 million Haitians are suffering from acute food insecurity, with 2 million\u2014about 18% of the population\u2014experiencing severe hunger. Of this group, 6,000 individuals are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity.\nViolence and security crisis means that people in Haiti cannot access and afford food\nIn the 1980s, Haiti\u2019s food production was self-sufficient. In 2014, only 2 per cent of Haiti\u2019s population was food insecure; today, that number has surged to nearly 50 per cent of the population, making it one of the top 10 crises in the world. In the past year, the situation deteriorated further, with another 1.2 million people plunged into food insecurity.\nAngeline Annesteus, president of CLIO, explains: \u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing in Haiti isn\u2019t a food shortage\u2014it\u2019s a hunger crisis. While markets may still have food, violence and inflation have driven prices out of reach for millions. Families are caught in a cycle of desperation, and urgent action is needed to break it.\u201d Up to 90 per cent of the capital city of Port-au-Prince is controlled by armed gangs and prices of food baskets have soared. People are struggling to access and afford nutritious food.\nWith road access cut off by gangs, many humanitarian organizations are struggling to deliver aid. \u201cSupplies from southern Haiti, a key region for food distribution, have been blocked for months. The cost of food has skyrocketed as trucks are forced to pay high bribes to pass through. It is difficult for local farmers to buy and sell agricultural products on the main markets, due to road closures between Port-au-Prince and the provinces,\u201d shares one humanitarian worker.\nViolence is driving a displacement crisis and forcing people to take desperate measures to survive\nThe endless cycle of violence has also led to almost 580,000 people being internally displaced since the escalation in gang violence which began in March 2024, more than double the figure from 2022. \u201cI left my home in P\u00e9tion-Ville because gangs were controlling the streets, fighting, burning down houses and businesses. We couldn\u2019t go out. We couldn\u2019t go to the markets. We didn\u2019t have enough food to eat. We were forced to leave the area we lived in,\u201d says Alexandra, who has fled to the outskirts of Port-au-Prince.\nWomen and children are particularly vulnerable in this crisis. In displacement camps, young girls as young as 15 are being coerced into trading sex for food. Marie, a Women Rights Militant, shares that schools can\u2019t function in several neighborhoods, so that children can\u2019t receive an education right now.\nMarie, Women Rights Militant from Limonade, North Department\nHumanitarian organizations urgently call for support\nDespite the dangers posed by gang-related violence, particularly in Port-au-Prince, local and international humanitarian organizations on the ground are managing to reach thousands of people with urgently needed assistance. Guerda Previlion, a local leader with the youth organization IDEJEN, highlights the importance of working closely with communities: \u201cWe build strong relationships with people in camps to ensure our work is successful and our staff can work safely \u2013 they are our sounding board and alarm system.\u201d\nHowever, this is not enough. To date, the humanitarian response in Haiti is critically underfunded, with less than 36 per cent of the required funding in place. This shortage of resources hinders the ability of aid agencies to respond at scale, leaving millions of Haitians in urgent need of assistance. But it is not too late to reverse this situation and ensure enough resources reach those in need.\nWe, the undersigned organizations, are urging the international community to respond to the hunger crisis in Haiti by:\n- Increasing financial support to humanitarian operations, including local actors and women-led organizations that are responding to the food and protection crises.\n- Support humanitarians\u2019 efforts to secure rapid, safe and unfettered humanitarian access to all areas in need across Haiti.\n- Strengthening diplomatic engagement with Haitians, including Haitian civil society, to find sustainable pathways to peace.\n##\nNotes to editors\nSpokespeople in Haiti are available including\n- Martine Villeneuve, Country Director, Action Against Hunger Haiti\n- Martin Dickler, Country Director, CARE Haiti\n- Kwanli Kladstrup, Country Director, Concern Worldwide Haiti\n- Angeline Annesteus, Country Director, Alianza por la Solidaridad/ActionAid Haiti, President, CLIO\n- Laurent Uwumuremyi, Country Director, Mercy Corps\nSignatories:\n-\nAction Against Hunger\n-\nInsecurity Insight\n-\nWorld Vision\n-\nActionAid\n-\nCARE\n-\nConcern Worldwide\n-\nGOAL\n-\nSave the Children\n-\nSOS Children Villages Ha\u00efti\n-\nCLIO \u2013 Cadre de Liaison Inter-Organisations\n-\nDKH \u2013 Diakonie Katastrophenhilfe\n-\nMercy Corps\nFor media inquiries, contact usa.media@care.org", "103832": "title: Haitian gang slaughters at least 70 people as thousands flee \n content: SUMMARY\nThis is AI generated summarization, which may have errors.

Gran Grif gang leader Luckson Elan took responsibility for the massacre, saying it was in retaliation for civilians remaining passive while police and vigilante groups killed his soldiers.\nSome 6,270 people had fled their homes due to the attacks, the UN migration agency said. Most of these are being sheltered by families living in nearby Saint-Marc and other towns, while others are staying in makeshift camps.\nThe gang members set fire to dozens of homes and vehicles, local authorities said, in one of the deadliest attacks in recent years in the Caribbean nation that has seen many massacres and little justice for their victims.\n\u201cThis odious crime against defenseless women, men, and children is not only an attack against victims but against the entire Haitian nation,\u201d Prime Minister Garry Conille said on X, adding that security forces were reinforcing the area.\nA spokesperson for Haiti\u2019s national police told Reuters on Friday evening that the director of police in charge of the Artibonite department had been replaced.\n\u201cFor now, reinforcements are at the location to contain the situation and security forces are in control,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe killings are the latest sign of a worsening conflict in Haiti, where armed gangs control most of the capital Port-au-Prince and are expanding to nearby regions, fuelling hunger and making hundreds of thousands homeless. Promised international support continues to lag and nearby nations have deported migrants back to the country.\n\u201cThe gang did not meet any resistance,\u201d Bertide Horace, spokesperson from the Dialogue and Reconciliation Commission to Save the Artibonite Valley, told Reuters, adding that police officers remained in their station, perhaps thinking they would be outgunned by the gang members.\nAn armored truck stationed in nearby Verrettes also failed to mobilize, said Horace, adding that two of her own family members were injured during the attack.\nMany victims were shot in the head as gang members went house to house, Horace said. \u201cThey were left to shoot anybody, everybody was running everywhere. They were walking, shooting people, killing people, burning people, burning homes, burning cars.\u201d\nRights organization RNDDH said the death toll was likely higher as entire families had been wiped out. \u201cAt the time of writing, corpses are strewn on the ground as their loved ones have not yet been able to recover them,\u201d it said in a report.\nRNDDH said rumors had been circulating for two months about a potential massacre in retaliation for residents\u2019 help for a vigilante group that was preventing the gang from extorting money on the national highway through the town.\n\u201cIf funds allocated to the intelligence service of various state institutions had been used effectively, the Pont-Sonde massacre could have been avoided,\u201d it said.\nParalyzed justice\nThe Artibonite has been the scene of the worst violence outside the capital, and residents have long called for more protection. Many residents of Pont-Sonde fled to Saint-Marc, where the already under-resourced public hospital is struggling to treat the injured.\nThe Gran Grif gang is based in the area and has been accused of mass kidnappings, rapes, murders, hijackings and forcing farmers off their lands, as well as child recruitment. Elan was added to the U.N. sanctions list last month.\nIn an audio message shared on social media on Thursday, Elan blamed the town\u2019s victims and the state for his gang\u2019s attack.\nAccording to the UN, no progress has been made in the cases of any mass killings committed since 2021, as well as several major massacres since 2017.\nPolice are alleged to have taken part in some mass killings.

The number of IDPs in MAPAP has decreased (-6%)\n---\nreflecting a continued outflow of people to provinces but at a lower volume compared to the period of March to April 2024.\n\nThe situation for displaced women and girls remains desperate as they struggle to secure even the most basic necessities. Current efforts to protect women and girls from violence in Haiti are not being delivered at the scale needed despite recent commitments from governments, UN agencies and NGOs to prioritize this crucial issue. Currently only 15 out of 85 IDP sites in Haiti receive protection services, including services for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV). Women and girls urgently need protection services, as well as access to reproductive health services, shelter, food, water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nFood insecurity, and the scarcity and costs of products at markets, is amplifying the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and increasing reliance on harmful coping mechanisms. Around 94 percent of women and girls are at risk of GBV and almost three-quarters (72 percent) of GBV incidents are sexual violence.\n\nUNFPA and its implementing partners continue to provide sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and GBV services where access is possible and security allows. This includes deploying mobile teams to IDP sites to provide integrated SRH/GBV services; the provision of remote psychosocial support, referrals, case documentation and GBV information via a hotline; and awareness raising activities on GBV and SRH and available services. UNFPA continues to support the GBV coordination mechanism at the national level and in Artibonite, in close collaboration with the Ministry on the Status and Rights of Women.\n\nSituation Overview\n\nGang violence continues to drive displacement, including in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Ganthier and Bas-Delmas. More than 700,000 persons are internally displaced across the country. Women and girls are particularly affected by the crisis \u2013 the risks of sexual violence in displacement sites has risen, in part, due to the poor living conditions.\n\nCriminal incidents, including armed robberies, burglaries and kidnappings, have recently increased in Haiti, particularly in MAPAP . Between January and end of August alone, more than 3,400 people were killed and 1,600 others injured in gang violence \u2014 with over 1,000 people kidnapped.\n\nThe Haitian government has renewed and extended a state of emergency to 19 September 2024 throughout the West Department and in all other communes where gangs are present, including Artibonite, the Central Plateau and Nippes.\n\nTensions between IDPs and host communities are more frequently reported in MAPAP than in provinces. Factors for tensions include a lack of resources, access to food, water and the high prices of products on the market since the arrival of IDPs. Access to land was also mentioned, especially in provinces.\n---\nDespite an improvement in the security situation, humanitarian access remains a challenge and is impacting service provision in areas where there are risks of attacks and abductions. Improving security conditions is the first factor reported by households who are considering returning home: 84% of households in IDP sites and 77% of households in host communities.\n\nAlthough more than 5 million people, roughly half the population, are going hungry and hundreds of thousands have been displaced, a $674 humanitarian appeal for Haiti has received just over a third (36 percent) of the funding. UNFPA has only managed to mobilize 19% of its required funding.\n\nThe Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission to support the Haitian National Police continues.

Two million \u2026 is massive.\u201d\nVilleneuve told The Associated Press that she also was surprised that some of the 2 million people hit by hunger don\u2019t even live in places directly affected by gang violence.\nWhile much of the hunger is directly tied to gang violence, double-digit inflation also has limited what many Haitians can afford to buy, with food now representing 70% of total household expenditures.\nThe cost of a food basket increased more than 11% in the past year, with inflation hitting 30% in July.\nIn addition, parts of Haiti are still struggling to recover from the August 2021 earthquake, various drought episodes, and Hurricane Matthew, which struck Haiti as a Category 4 storm in 2016.\nGang violence, however, accounts for most of the hunger, with gangs controlling 80% of Port-au-Prince and the roads that lead to and from northern and southern Haiti, preventing farmers from delivering goods and nonprofits from delivering aid.\nFrom April to June, at least 1,379 people were reported killed or injured, and another 428 kidnapped. In addition, gang violence has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years.\nA U.N.-backed mission led by Kenya that began in late June and is aimed at quelling gang violence in Haiti has liberated some communities. But officials say much work remains to be done as the U.S., Haiti and others call for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to secure funding and personnel that the current mission lacks.\n\u201cHaiti continues to face a worsening humanitarian crisis, with alarming rates of armed gang violence disrupting daily life, forcing more people to flee their homes and levels of acute food insecurity to rise,\u201d the report stated.\nIn 2014, only 2% of Haiti\u2019s population was food insecure, a number that has soared to nearly 50%, according to Mercy Corps, one of several nonprofits that called for an increase in funding on Monday.\nDujarric said humanitarian food agencies and nonprofits in Haiti need an additional $230 million until year\u2019s end.\nSeventy percent of people living in makeshift shelters are experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse, the report found.\nAmong those experiencing hunger is Joceline St-Louis, a 28-year-old mother of two boys, 5 and 1. \u201cFood doesn\u2019t come around very often,\u201d she said, adding that she depends on others to feed her children.\n\u201cWhen an organization does provide food, there\u2019s a major fight,\u201d she said.\nSt-Louis said she has to take her 1-year-old to a clinic so he can receive a peanut butter mix \u201cso that his body doesn\u2019t collapse in my arms.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sometimes so depressed that I sometimes want to kill the kids and myself,\u201d she said in a soft voice as she cradled the 1-year-old in her arms while the 5-year-old played with his friends.\nIn another shelter nearby, Judeline Auguste, 39, said she depends solely on remittances to feed herself and her 8-year-old boy, but the money barely lasts a week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that I can get a meal a day,\u201d she said. \u201cMy situation is hard not because of me, but because of my son. He looks at other people eating all the time, and he starts crying, \u2018Mommy, I\u2019m hungry.\u2019\u201d\nMeanwhile, those facing urgent levels of hunger live in Haiti\u2019s northern, central and southern regions, as well as in the capital.\nJean Yonel, who fled his home with his family after gangs raided their neighborhood, said there are days that he, his wife and their seven children eat only white rice or spaghetti.\n\u201cI can\u2019t provide every day for these children,\u201d Yonel said. \u201cSometimes we take just a spoonful of food and leave the rest of the food for the kids so they don\u2019t die.\u201d\nYonel used to work as a mason, but with construction jobs drying up, he is now forced to search for wood to make charcoal. His wife sells second-hand clothes.\nOn days when they can\u2019t afford a proper meal for their children, she mixes flour with spinach to keep their stomachs from rumbling.\n___\nCoto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In the capital city of Port-au-Prince, gangs are committing extreme acts of violence that are directly and indirectly affecting citizens. Many citizens have fled areas where gangs have taken over, leaving many displaced from their homes and in urgent need of humanitarian aid. The International Organization of Migration estimates that, in early 2024 alone, a record number of nearly 580,000 Haitians were internally displaced by the conflict.\n\nPrime Minister Garry Conille announced on August 29, 2024 that Haitian forces working with Kenyan police had launched a joint operation to oust criminal gangs from Bel Air, one of the roughest neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince. Kenyan police forces are a part of the multinational security support mission (MSS) that is working to secure public safety and protect critical infrastructure, including the airport and critical roads.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund and the Center for Strategic and International Studies both report increasing levels of GBV. Risks were noted in 14 of the surveyed displacement sites, with more than half of the latrines and many showers not separated\n\nComplex Emergency in Haiti \u2014 July 2024 Page 1 of 5\n\nAugust 2024 Impact 33,600+ participants reached\n\nHealth: 8,681 patients received medical care and treatment through Project HOPE\u2019s mobile medical units (MMUs). 2,853 patients received primary health care services at five health facilities that Project HOPE is supporting in the Sud and Grand\u2019Anse departments.\n\nProtection: Project HOPE provided 9,974 people with mental health and gender-based violence (GBV) awareness activities.

Women and girls, in particular, have continued to be disproportionately impacted by the crisis in Haiti, with 2023 reporting by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) showing a 49% increase in GBV and pregnant women facing difficulties accessing essential maternal health services.\n\nThe United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti, reports that at least 1,379 people were killed or injured and another 428 were kidnapped between April 1 and June 30, 2024. These numbers represent a decrease in the number of killings, compared with the more than 2,500 killings reported in the first quarter of 2024, while the number of kidnappings has remained similar. The report also highlighted an increase in rape and other GBV in gang-controlled neighbourhoods and sites for internally displaced people (IDPs), with service providers reporting receiving an average of 40 rape survivors each day in areas of Port-au-Prince.\n\nChildren continue to be impacted by the violence and are increasingly targeted for recruitment by gangs. Gangs also continue to vandalize, steal, and set fire to public buildings, with more than 450 homes and businesses destroyed in the period.\n\nProject HOPE\u2019s Response in Haiti\n\nProject HOPE is responding to health; protection; and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) needs in the Sud, Nippes, and Grand\u2019Anse departments. Our programs focus on increasing access to primary health care and protection services, training frontline health workers, providing pharmaceuticals and medicines, promoting sanitation and hygiene, and responding to extreme weather and health crises as they arise.\n\nDuring the month of August 2024, Project HOPE's activities reached 2,058 IDPs, including 887 through mobile clinic activities, 572 through hygiene promotion activities and 599 through protection activities. There are still restrictions to humanitarian access, which is negatively impacting communities. Organizations are preparing for hurricane season, as the risk of water-borne and vector-borne disease outbreaks increases during this time. Project HOPE reamains committed to providing quality health services and humanitarian assistance to communities in the Grand Sud region of Haiti.\n\nA member of Project HOPE team in Haiti talks with a mother at a mobile medical unit clinic in the Sud Department of Haiti.

Project HOPE was able to increase the number of MMUs from one to eight per week and double the number of patients assisted. Out of those 8,681 patients, 887 were internally displaced persons, 284 identified as male and 603 identified as female.\n\nProject HOPE is currently supporting five health facilities across the Sud and Grand\u2019Anse departments by providing a variety of primary health care services, including infectious disease, noncommunicable disease, sexual and reproductive health, clinical mental health, and GBV care consultations. At these health facilities, Project HOPE staff cared for 2,853 patients in August, treating 485 for communicable diseases, 973 for non- communicable diseases, 623 for injuries, 10 for mental health disorders, 363 for reproductive health services, and 399 for other health issues. In August, Project HOPE also conducted trainings and refresher courses for the mobile clinic teams and conducted supervisor visits to the supported health facilities.\n\nAs hurricane season approaches and gang violence continues in Haiti, national and local supply chains may be interrupted unexpectedly. In preparation of hurricane season, Project HOPE will continue to provide medical supplies and essentials to MMUs and health facilities promote a stronger health system. Project HOPE is also coordinating with other humanitarian actors to prepare for potential future cholera outbreaks.\n\nA Project HOPE staff member talks with a young girl about proper use of medicines at a mobile medical unit clinic in the Sud Department.

In August, our team reached over 9,900+ people in the Sud and Nippes departments with awareness-raising activities on GBV and mental health. Some topics that were highlighted were: sexual harassment,\n\nComplex Emergency in Haiti \u2014 July 2024 Page 3 of 5\n---\ndomestic violence, physical violence, harmful traditional practices, and stress management. The team provided psychosocial support through Program Management Plus (PM+) to 528 people, including 26 IDPs, addressing adversity, stress management, problem management, depression, and anxiety concerns.\n\nIn Grand\u2019Anse and Nippes departments, hygiene kits were distributed to GBV survivors, women and girls at risk of harm, and IDPs. In August, the Project HOPE team made plans to honor World Suicide Prevention Day on September 10th by hosting activities in Camp- Perrin and Maniche. Project HOPE aims to continue strengthening mental health and GBV prevention resources by providing referral services, psychosocial support through PM+ group sessions, and follow-up services.\n\nWASH\n\nIn August, Project HOPE reached 15,297 people with hygiene promotion and awareness- raising activities, covering topics such as hand hygiene, food safety, and waste management. Our teams report that, following increasing numbers of IDPs in the communities Project HOPE is providing assistance in, the urgency and scale of need for clean water sources and hygiene promotion have been exacerbated.\n\nA Project HOPE team member listens to a mother\u2019s heartbeat as she holds her daughter in her lap at a mobile medical unit clinic in Sud Department.

Heavy fighting in and around Jabaliya, which is under siege, continues to be reported, as does indiscriminate rocket fire by Palestinian armed groups toward Israel,\" she said.\nIt is estimated that 55,000 people have been displaced from the Jabaliya area, while others remain stranded in their homes with water and food running out.\nShe added that 13 members of a single family were killed on Tuesday after rescue workers were again prevented from reaching the wounded trapped under the rubble.\n\"The images emerging from the camp show a traumatized population, running for their lives, with no safe place to go,\" she said.\nConcern for pregnant women\nMeanwhile, only three of the 10 hospitals in North Gaza Governorate are now operational, but only at minimum capacity, and with dire shortages of fuel, blood, trauma treatment and medications.\nMs. Msuya highlighted the situation of the 155,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women in Gaza, where giving birth is exhausting and traumatic.\n\"There is no antenatal care. There is no medication. And then there is hunger,\" she said. \"Some 11,000 pregnant women are suffering hunger and malnutrition, putting not just their lives at risk, but also the lives of their newborn babies.\"\nHelp to hospitals\nShe said that following nine separate attempts, an inter-agency team from the UN, an international non-governmental organization (NGO) and the Palestine Red Crescent Society, was finally able to reach the Kamal Adwan and Al-Sahaba hospitals in northern Gaza on 12 October.\nThey eventually transferred more than a dozen critical patients from Kamal Adwan to Al-Shifa hospital. Additional patients and their companions - who had earlier been transferred to Kamal Adwan from Al-Awda hospital - were also taken to Al-Shifa.\nThe team also delivered fuel to keep Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda functioning, while Al-Sahaba Hospital received fuel as well as blood units, \"but humanitarian aid cannot be provided in one-off batches,\" she said.\nHumanitarians under fire\nMs. Msuya recalled that the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Kamal Adwan hospital is overwhelmed, receiving between 50 and 70 newly injured patients each day.\n\"These missions were completed amid fierce ongoing hostilities,\" she told the Council.\n\"Drivers from the United Nations and the Palestine Red Crescent Society were subjected to humiliating treatment during security screening and temporary detention at a checkpoint.\"\nFood aid running out\nMs. Msuya then turned to the dire food situation in the north. She said no food entered from 2 to 15 October, \"when a trickle was allowed in, and all essential supplies for survival are running out.\"\nShe stressed that distributions of existing food supplies need to continue, but stocks are dwindling.\nShe said that in Gaza City, more than 110,000 meals are distributed each day by at least 10 kitchens, including to support the influx of people displaced from North Gaza governorate.\nMeanwhile, between 11 and 13 October, UN partners in North Gaza governorate distributed more than 1,500 food parcels and 1,500 bags of wheat flour to displaced people trapped or sheltering in and near schools in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahya.\nShe warned, however, that there is now barely any food left to distribute, and most bakeries will be forced to shut down again in the next several days without additional fuel.\n\"Given the abject conditions and intolerable suffering in north Gaza, the fact that humanitarian access is nearly non-existent is unconscionable,\" she stated.\nAid missions impeded\nMs. Msuya reported that during the first two weeks of October, Israel facilitated just one out of 54 coordinated movements to the north via the Al Rashid checkpoint, while another four were impeded but eventually accomplished.\nShe said 85 per cent of the movements were denied, and the rest were impeded or cancelled, due to security or logistical issues.\n\"Throughout Gaza, less than a third of the 286 humanitarian missions coordinated with Israeli authorities in the first two weeks of October were facilitated without major incidents or delays,\" she said.\n\"Every time a mission is impeded, the lives of people in need and humanitarians on the ground are put at even greater risk. This woeful and unacceptable trend must change.\"\nUNRWA and partners have started the second round of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza.\nPolio campaign continues\nHumanitarians recently launched the second phase of a mass polio vaccination campaign in Gaza which has reached nearly 157,000 children so far, according to WHO.\nMs. Msuya said the campaign once again underscored the critical role of UNRWA, the UN Palestine refugee agency, whose teams vaccinated 43 per cent of the children reached on the first day.\n\"It is now critical that the parties continue to respect the agreed humanitarian pauses and that access be granted throughout Gaza to ensure that we can reach all children in need of the vaccine, including in the north,\" she said.\nAlgeria calls for decisive action on Northern Gaza crisis\nAlgeria's Ambassador Amar Benjama reiterated that the situation in Gaza has reached a \"catastrophic level\", calling on Israel to fulfil its obligation to protect civilian lives under International Law.\n\"How is it possible that we can vaccinate these children, yet we cannot feed them?\", he asked, in relation to the second round of polio vaccinations underway, adding that the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is explicitly prohibited - referring to a \"deliberate, calculated Israeli policy of starvation.\"\nReferring to Council resolution 2728, which \"reiterates its demand for the lifting of all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale,\" the Ambassador said in the past week \"a mere six trucks per day have been permitted to enter Gaza, a number so paltry it borders on the absurd given the scale of need.\"\nMr. Benjama also issued a warning over legislation in the Israeli Knesset which could potentially halt UNRWA's operations: \"Such actions,\" he said, \"would strip Gazans of the backbone of humanitarian aid and further complicate the United Nations' mission.\"\nFrance laments 'human toll' in northern Gaza\nThe Ambassador of France, Nicolas de Rivi\u00e8re, condemned Israeli airstrikes on civilian infrastructure in Gaza. He called on the authorities to guarantee the protection of all civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law.\n\"We express our alarm at the extremely grave nature of the situation in the north of Gaza,\" he said, noting that the \"human toll is already very heavy\".\nCiting local authorities, he said there have been almost 300 victims, and 100 people wounded, in a week.\nMr. de Rivi\u00e8re said Israeli authorities must lift the obstacles hindering aid delivery. \"Access has never been as restricted since the start of the conflict,\" he added.\nHe also urged Israel \"to cease projects aiming to criminalize UNWRA activities\" and prevent the agency from operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\"That would only worsen a humanitarian situation which is already catastrophic,\" he warned.\nAny 'policy of starvation' would be 'horrific and unacceptable': US\nUnited States' Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield expressed deep concern reflecting on the devastating scenes of civilian casualties following Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza saying there were \"no words\" to describe the horror of seeing some burned alive.\nThe Ambassador highlighted US diplomatic efforts that saw the Erez crossing reopened, with Israel now committed, she said, to \"at least one other route\" for aid. However, levels remain inadequate she added: \"Food and supplies must be surged into Gaza immediately.\"\nMs. Thomas-Greenfield called again for humanitarian pauses across Gaza and she said in relation to media reports of a so-called \"policy of starvation\" plan by Israel, any such move \"would be horrific and unacceptable under international law and US law.\"\nMoreover, she affirmed that the Government of Israel had guaranteed that \"food and other essential supplies will not be cut off,\" further stating: \"We will be watching to see that Israel's actions on the ground match this statement.\"\nLooking ahead, the Ambassador urged Israel to collaborate with the UN and the international community to plan for the eventual reconstruction of Gaza. \"I repeat, the United States calls for this work to begin now.\"\n'There is no rule Israel did not break': Palestine\nPalestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour condemned Israel's actions as systematic violations of international law.\n400,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza face bombings, starvation, and a lack of humanitarian aid, forced to choose between \"staying and dying or leaving to face death elsewhere\".\n\"That is not war,\" he added. \"These are crimes. They must be stopped. And they must be stopped now.\"\nThe Ambassador highlighted Israel's attacks on Palestine refugee agency UNRWA and framed these actions as part of a larger strategy to make life unlivable in the enclave.

The mobile teams provide Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS), basic health care, water and connectivity. The teams also provide access to InfoDigna, a digital platform created to support people on the move, enabling them to make informed decisions, stay\n\nsafe, access essential services, and understand their rights. Access to documentation is an additional critical priority. Due to restrictive migration policies and\n\nbacklogs in asylum applications, obtaining documents for legal stay in Mexico has becom e increasingl y challenging .

This highlights the need for programs that exten d beyond humanitarian aid, even in transit areas, due to the increased waiting times in Mexico. Illustrativel y, almost half of the people on the move Marginalized groups, including individuals with disabiliti\n\nes, people wi th diver se SOGIESC , those with out r egular status in Mexi co, a nd non-S panish sp eakers , face the greatest challenges in accessing their rights.\n\nThe\n\naffected population\n\nThe affected population continues to face significant protection risks. Among 817 respondents in DRC\u2019s Protection Monitoring from January through August 2024 in Reynosa, Matamoros and Tapachula, 42% reported that a member of their household had experienced violence while in Mexico, with extortion, kidnapping, physical aggression and sexual and gender-based violence being the most common forms reported. More than half of all of these incidents were reported to have taken place during transit through the country.\n\nWhile criminal groups were the main perpetrator reported by respondents, nearly one third of incidents of violence reported to DRC were attributed to the authorities. This not only suggests significant patterns of corruption, but also evidences the unavailability of protection from violence for those on the move in Mexico. The exposure to violence is compounded by the unsafe and precarious conditions in which many people on the move are housed, with 29% of respondents reporting that they do not feel safe in their current shelter.\n---\nAt the same time, coercion in multiple forms continues to threaten those on the move in Mexico, including through arbitrary detention and family separation. While litigation led to limitations on the length of immigration detention, the nature of those restrictions on liberty continues to be characterized by its automatic and discretionary nature, without any consideration of the need or proportionality of the detention, and without respect for due process. During the first 6 months of 2024, Mexican authorities detained twice as many people on the move as they did during the same period last year. A pattern of automatically detaining individuals at check-points in the northern part of the country and subsequently transferring them to detention facilities in the southern part of the country prior to release was reported by numerous respondents throughout the year. Although just under 7% of respondents confirmed that a member of their household had been held in a detention center, more than 20% reported facing check-points, of which nearly 90% reported the occurrence of abuses at these check- points. Some of those interviewed reported having been separated from family members as a result of these measures.\n\nAt the same time, coercion in multiple DRC teams in Mexico are experienced in implementing a robust, evidence-based and context-specific\n\nprotection response informed by regular Protection Monitoring. On the southern border in Tapachula, DRC has focused efforts on providing legal assistance in obtaining documentation of legal stay in Mexico, including temporary stay for humanitarian reasons and permanent status through family-based regularization, and in supporting asylum-seekers with navigating the process with the COMAR. In parallel, DRC provides tailored in-kind assistance to mitigate specific protection risks while also distributing kits and providing cash and voucher assistance to targeted profiles. On the northeast border in Reynosa and Matamoros, DRC\u2019s efforts have grown to include specific measures to support survivors and those at heightened risk of sexual and gender-based violence, including through targeted distribution of non-food items to reduce the harm of these forms of violence and through cash and voucher assistance. DRC\u2019s Tamaulipas team will also offer group and individual psychosocial support by the end of 2024. DRC has a growing network of local partner organizations in different locations within the country in order to expand the impact of its humanitarian intervention while also strengthening local capacities to provide a high- quality and principled response.\n\nSimilarly, numerous deliberate deprivations persist, including the denial of the right to seek asylum, both in Mexico and the U.S., for certain groups. Mexican asylum authorities continue regular procedures, but practices like triaging and postponing application receptions have delayed asylum- seekers from seeking protection. On the northern border, the multiple policies implemented by U.S. authorities continued to deliberately prevent Mexicans intending to apply for asylum from leaving the country where they fear persecution and people of multiple other nationalities from having a meaningful opportunity to seek effective protection. Asylum processing is now predominantly managed through the the CBP One app, an appointment system inaccessible to many in need of international protection.\n---\nThe available statistics illustrate how the restrictions in both countries force individuals to take more dangerous routes: a record number of migrant deaths on the U.S.-Mexico border was reported in July, despite significantly lower levels of people entering the country. PROTECTION The IRC implements projects The IRC implements projects to support those at risk along Mexico\u00b4s main migration routes. By offering case management for survivors of violence, gender-based violence prevention activities, child protection interventions and technical support to shelters, the organization works to prevent and respond to violence. Through the InfoDigna platform, tailored information is provided to aid safe decision-making, and to facilitate access support after rights violations. To promote safe access to effective asylum procedures, the IRC collaborates with the Mexican Commission for Refugees (COMAR) to improve accessibility and inclusivity. This partnership includes training, legal assistance, interpretation support, and providing information and services for successful integration. IRC directly supports a network of local actors providing protection services to the population on the move.

One-third of those displaced nationwide left their homes in the first half of the year, marking this as a period with one of the highest levels of displacement in Haiti\u2019s recent history. More than 90% of all displaced people originated from the Ouest department, particularly the ZMPAP, which accounted for 85% of the national total. These areas also experienced the highest violence-related incidents between 2023\u20132024 (IOM 09/06/2024; ACLED 07/08/2024; IOM accessed 27/09/2024).\n\nNearly half of those displaced (315,200) have sought refuge in the Grand Sud region, in the departments of Grande\u2019Anse, Nippes, Sud, and Sud-Est. The arrival of an increasing number of IDPs in these departments could increase pressure on already limited resources and services. In 2023, over one million people in the Grand Sud region required humanitarian assistance, including food, healthcare, and WASH services (IOM 22/09/2024; OCHA 17/04/2023; WFP 15/03/2024; STC 26/03/2024). The Grand Sud region was already sheltering over 116,000 IDPs \u2013 particularly in Sud (38,000) and Sud-Est (37,000) \u2013 by late 2023, mostly displaced from the ZMPAP as a result of violence in 2022\u20132023 (IOM 16/01/2024, and 09/06/2024; ACLED 07/08/2024; IOM/Shelter Cluster 10/10/2023).\n\nSud department has received the most IDPs in 2024 so far, with around 116,000 by September, a figure only surpassed by the displaced population in the ZMPAP. Despite this, however, there are no official IDP sites in Sud, forcing the displaced to stay with host communities, typically family members or acquaintances. Food shortages remain the main issue for host communities and the Grand Sud region in general (IOM 22/09/2024 and 09/06/2024).\n\nFood assistance is expected to be a priority need for IDPs and host communities. Over 1,050,000 people are already projected to face severe acute food insecurity in the Grand Sud region. With the growing population, more\n\nAny comments or questions?

Agricultural production in 2024 has been below the seasonal average as a result of erratic rainfall and overall insecurity affecting access to land, the availability of seeds, and the cost of labour, among other effects. Since February 2024, gangs have also attacked trucks transporting food and blocked roads used to move products from farming areas or import zones to markets across the country, further affecting food availability (FEWS NET 13/09/2024 and 31/08/2024; FAO 10/9/2024; UN 22/04/2024).\n\nIn Grand Sud, the Grand\u2019Anse and Sud-Est departments have been hit hardest by rising household and transportation-related costs throughout 2024, putting host communities and the broader population at increased risk of food insecurity, as less locally produced and imported food is expected to reach the departments\u2019 local markets (WFP 27/06/2024 and 19/01/2024; FEWS NET 13/09/2024; WP 07/03/2024).\n\nThe already underfunded national healthcare system, which was further weakened by the insecurity crisis, is likely unable to cope with the high number of new arrivals. Anticipated above-average rainfall and temperature created by La Ni\u00f1a, expected mainly in eastern Haiti near the border with the Dominican Republic, could lead to a rise in waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever, requiring increased medical care for both displaced and host communities (WMO accessed 14/09/2024; IRI accessed 14/09/2024; CDC 01/05/2023; FEWS NET 14/06/2024; Lifewater 23/05/2019).\n\nAlthough violence against civilians has decreased in the ZMPAP in Mid-2024, as gangs appear to be consolidating their positions, renewed clashes remain a possibility. This could lead to further internal displacement, with more people fleeing the ZMPAP for Grand Sud, as seen in recent weeks in Delmas, where more than 2,000 people left their homes after gangs clashed in the Boston neighbourhood on 11 September (IOM 14/09/2024). If gangs continue to expand their presence and increase activities in more areas of the country, food could become even less available and accessible throughout the region, as happened previously (WFP 15/03/2024; STC 26/03/2024).\n---\nKEY NEEDS IN THE GRAND SUD REGION\n\n1,000,000 people were to face acute food insecurity by mid-2024, not including the latest IDPs.\n\nAccess to food is the main humanitarian need of IDPs and host communities in the Grand Sud region. The combination of insecurity, logistical limitations, and below-average local food production increases the challenge of supplying local markets with affordable food, especially in more remote areas of the Grand\u2019Anse and Sud departments (OCHA 19/01/2024; IPC 22/03/2024).\n\n600,000 people required shelter in the Grand Sud region by late 2023.\n\nDisplaced people face barriers accessing shelter as a result of rising rental prices, a lack of IDP sites in the region, and the limited capacity of host communities (OCHA 19/01/2024).\n\nHUMANITARIAN CONSTRAINTS\n\nThe deterioration of security conditions in Port-au-Prince has directly affected the work of humanitarian responders across Haiti. Gang-imposed roadblocks have limited the ability to cross and leave the ZMPAP, leading to the closure of major routes connecting the capital with the rest of the country, including Grand Sud, and hindering humanitarian access to those in need outside the ZMPAP (OCHA 27/03/2024).\n\nPort-au-Prince is the country\u2019s main entry point for international aid. Logistical disruptions, such as the airport closure between February\u2013May and sporadic seaport closures, dependent on security conditions, have translated into less humanitarian aid being distributed nationwide, particularly healthcare supplies (MSF 21/05/2024; UNICEF 16/03/2024; BBC 21/05/2024). At the end of September, the port was closed by the Caribbean Port Services as a preventive measure against gang attacks. This closure blocked the entry of humanitarian goods arriving by sea and increased the overall cost of bringing supplies into the country (Reuters 26/09/2024; Crisis24 27/09/2024).\n\nInsecurity may also reduce the number of humanitarian personnel in the country, as the risk of attack, kidnapping, or being caught up in clashes has increased since the beginning of 2024 (OCHA 19/08/2024; La Croix 27/05/2024).\n\nAnticipatory note | 03 October 2024\n\nCURRENT HUMANITARIAN NEEDS Food and nutrition\n\nAn estimated 4.4 million people are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse levels of food insecurity in 2024, a 4% decrease from 2023, thanks partly to increased humanitarian aid. For the Grand Sud region, more than one million people were to face acute food insecurity (IPC 3+) by mid-2024, including 61% of the population of Grand-Anse facing acute food insecurity (OCHA 19/01/2024; IPC 22/03/2024).\n\nOver one million people in Haiti will require treatment for malnutrition in 2024, a 35% increase from 2023. Severe malnutrition remains the primary challenge across Haiti, particularly in the Sud department, where displaced children can no longer engage with humanitarian programmes aimed at combatting malnutrition. Such children had been attending these programmes in their hometowns within or near the ZMPAP, but it is unclear if such humanitarian responders are present in Grand Sud (OCHA 19/01/2024; UNICEF 26/03/2024; IPC 08/03/2024).\n\nBetween June and November 2024, 277,000 children up to five years of age are expected to face acute malnutrition across Haiti. Parts of the Nippes, Sud, and Sud-Est departments are also expected to move from None (IPC Phase 1), the acceptable level on the IPC acute malnutrition scale, to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) levels or IPC 3 by November 2024 (IPC 08/03/2024).\n\nFood inflation is a major factor limiting displaced people\u2019s access to food. Since the beginning of 2024, food prices have risen by 40%, driven by supply chain disruptions caused by insecurity and anticipated low production from the spring harvest. Road disruptions affecting supply routes to markets in the Sud-Est and Nippes departments may further reduce food availability in these areas (FEWS NET 14/06/2024).\n\nAccess to food is particularly difficult for host communities in the Grand Sud region, as they struggle to provide for more people while seeing further strain on incomes and diminishing food availability (FEWS NET 14/06/2024).\n\nHealth system\n\nIn 2024, an estimated 4.7 million people \u2014 40% of Haiti\u2019s population \u2014 are expected to require assistance to access health services, as the fragile healthcare system is unable to meet the population\u2019s needs. Hospitals in departments such as Grand\u2019Anse, Nippes, and Sud\n---\nare unable to meet growing healthcare needs, including for pregnant women and newborns, as a result of inadequate infrastructure, limited funding, and a shortage of healthcare professionals (HOPE 09/05/2024; WB 06/04/2023; MSH 09/02/2023).\n\nAt the end of 2022, 73% of the country\u2019s 22 major hospitals reported an inability to function normally owing to road blockages, supply import issues, logistical challenges moving supplies and staff across the country, and poor funding, which only worsened with rising insecurity in the first half of 2024 (MSF 21/05/2024; UNICEF 16/03/2024; BBC 23/05/2024).\n\nIn the Grand Sud region, there is concern that supplies will be insufficient to aid the increasing number of displaced people in need of health services, especially if import limitations resulting from port closures in Port-au-Prince continue. In Nippes, there is a risk that poor infrastructure will mean that IDPs in rural communities cannot access healthcare services (HOPE 26/03/2024).\n\nEducation\n\n52% of Haiti\u2019s displaced population are children, whose access to education is severely limited in the regions to which they fled. This is particularly evident in Grand Sud, where some schools are still awaiting repair from the effects of natural hazards, including those affected by the 2021 earthquake. Schools that are open are overwhelmed by the arrival of new students (IOM 09/06/2024; UNICEF 19/09/2023, 09/02/2022, and 11/09/2024).\n\nShelter and housing\n\nIn 2023, 4.6 million people required assistance accessing housing, particularly displaced individuals unable to find shelter with host families and forced to reside in makeshift IDP sites. Over 600,000 people required shelter in the Grand Sud region by the end of 2023, a number that has likely increased with the arrival of new IDPs and the absence of formal IDP sites (OCHA 19/01/2024).\n\nRising rental prices, especially for rooms rented to IDPs, are worsening the housing crisis in Grand Sud. Landlords are increasing rental prices as the displaced population grows, further limiting access for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (OCHA 19/01/2024).\n\nSome people living in host communities in Sud department are likely to be living in crowded conditions, in houses built with mud, sand, cane, and palm. These materials are less resistant to strong winds and rainfall, making them more vulnerable to natural hazards (USAID accessed 29/09/2024).\n\nAnticipatory note | 03 October 2024\n\nDRIVERS OF THE CRISIS AND AGGRAVATING FACTORS Political instability\n\nPolitical instability is a driver and aggravating factor of both displacement across Haiti and the limited services for IDPs and host communities in Grand Sud. In 2021, President Jovenel Moise was assassinated, leaving a power vacuum and political uncertainty, which propelled Ariel Henry into the role of Interim Prime Minister. Despite promises, elections were postponed and Henry was forced to step down in March 2024 as a result of the surge in gang violence earlier in the year (BBC 12/03/2024; IRC 07/04/2023 and 13/12/2023). Since 2023, no elected officials have been in power in Haiti.\n\nCurrently, Garry Conille serves as Interim Prime Minister, appointed by a transitional council comprising several Caribbean countries. It is unclear how much control Conille has over the Government in the capital, however, as gangs have gained control of and cut off Port-au- Prince from the rest of the country (DW 12/06/2024; NYT 09/07/2024).\n\nLimited law enforcement also contributes to insecurity, while the instability of the administration and economic challenges diminish the State\u2019s capacity to support those in need.\n\nInsecurity\n\nInsecurity is the main driver of increased displacement in Grand Sud. Since March 2024, gangs have launched attacks on government infrastructure, prisons, police stations, the airport, and the seaport in the ZMPAP, effectively paralysing the Government and limiting the work of humanitarian responders (UNICEF 16/03/2024; HRW 08/03/2024).\n\nIn response, a Kenyan contingent was deployed to Port-au-Prince in June to support the Haitian police attempt to regain control of the capital. By September, however, gangs still controlled parts of the city (HRW 28/05/2024; Africa News 13/08/2024; BBC 05/09/2024). Fighting, extortion, road blockages, and attacks on public institutions have continued, leading to further forced displacement (BBC 05/09/2024; Ayibopost 29/07/2024; IOM 14/09/2024).\n---\nLa Ni\u00f1a and related hazards\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a is expected to bring above-average rainfall to Haiti by the end of 2024, especially in the Grand Sud region, and temperatures are expected to be above average from September to early 2025. These conditions raise the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever spreading in the region (WMO accessed 19/09/2024, CDC 01/05/2023).\n\nThe consequences of La Ni\u00f1a may be worse in Grand\u2019Anse and Sud, the two departments whose location and lack of preparedness make them most vulnerable to hurricanes and drought (USAID accessed 29/09/2024).\n\nMAP AND TABLE 1. IDPS AND IPC FOOD INSECURITY PROJECTIONS IN THE GRAND SUD\n\nAnticipatory note | 03 October 2024\n\nContinuing obstacles to accessing WASH services further worsen the humanitarian crisis. At least 26% of Haitians lack access to clean water, 75% have no soap for handwashing, and about 70% have no access to improved sanitation systems \u2014 a situation only worsened by increased displacement since early 2024. Such conditions also aggravate the spread of waterborne diseases (UNICEF 08/05/2024; OCHA 26/08/2024).\n\nSources: ACAPS with data from IOM (22/09/2024); IPC (22/03/2024) Note: IPC projections were published in March, at the beginning of increased number of IDP arrivals to Grand Sud. The new IDPs are not counted in the projections.", "160362": "title: HAITI Impact of conflict on children and youth \n content: HAITI Impact of conflict on children and youth\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSince the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in July 2021, conflict in Haiti has intensified, and armed gangs have taken control of large parts of the country. The situation worsened in March 2024 when gangs attacked the country\u2019s two largest prisons, the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince (PAP) and the Croix-des-Bouquets civil prison, freeing over 4,000 inmates. In the same month, they also besieged the airport and forced Prime Minister Ariel Henry into exile (TNH 26/06/2024; ACLED 06/03/2024; InSight Crime 27/05/2024).\n\nThe escalating violence has aggravated the already dire conditions of poverty and political instability facing civilians. ACLED estimates that over 5.1 million people (around 56% of the population), including children, will continue to be exposed to violence throughout 2024 (ACLED 07/08/2024).\n\nThe area most affected by violence and insecurity is the capital city, the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (including communes in Carrefour, Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Delmas, P\u00e9tion-Ville, PAP, and Tabarre), where the population has decreased significantly because of massive displacement towards other areas of the country (Flowminder Foundation 03/05/2024). In March 2024 alone, 300,000 people (more than 10% of its pre-March population of 2,980,000) left the city because of insecurity (MT accessed 16/09/2024; Mercy Corps 27/08/2024). Artibonite department is also among the most affected areas; between April\u2013June, at least 312 (73%) of the 428 reported kidnappings countrywide occurred in the department (BINUH 30/06/2024).\n\nWhile exact figures on the number of children affected by violence are not available, the recent developments in the country have significantly affected the protection, shelter, education, and physical and mental health needs of civilians, including children. Increased food insecurity and malnutrition, a cholera outbreak, and the current hurricane season compound this situation. In June 2024, nearly three million children (out of a total of 4.3 million children countrywide) were in urgent need of humanitarian aid (WCP accessed 20/09/2024; UNICEF 15/06/2023).\n\nAny comments or questions?

They face violence from several perpetrators, including armed gangs and self-defence brigades (armed civilians aiming to protect people from these gangs) (AJ 28/03/2024; ICG 03/07/2023).\n\nChildren are at high risk of forced recruitment into armed gangs, sexual abuse, and other protection threats. Women and girls are at particularly high risk of gender-based violence (GBV), especially in IDP communities.\n\nEducation access is limited because many schools are serving as IDP centres. At the same time, insecurity is preventing many children from going to school.\n\nThere is limited information on unaccompanied and separated children, but the increase in internal and cross-border displacement is separating children from their families.\n\nSevere acute malnutrition among children increased by almost 20% between January\u2013 July 2024, with nearly 125,000 Haitian children facing severe acute malnutrition in July.\n\nIncreased malnutrition, violence, and poor WASH and health access, which has resulted in decreased vaccination rates, heighten children\u2019s vulnerability to injury and waterborne, vector-borne, gastrointestinal, and other diseases. Children have limited healthcare access, with 40% of inpatient facilities in PAP closed since May 2024 because of insecurity.\n\nAbout this report\n\nAim: the report aims to provide an overview of the humanitarian needs and risks children are facing given the escalating violence in Haiti. While mainly covering the escalation of conflict in 2024 and its impact on children, the report also provides contextual information. It covers the situation across the country, with a particular focus on Port- au-Prince (Ouest department) and Artibonite, where the conflict has been most severe.\n\nMethodology: the report is based on a secondary data review. This is complemented by three key informant interviews conducted in August 2024 with NGOs focused on children\u2019s needs and protection at the national and regional levels.\n---\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n\nUntil 23 September 2024, the country remained in a state of emergency, which was declared on 17 July in PAP and extended on 4 September to cover the entire country (US DOS accessed 27/09/2024; BBC 05/09/2024; Jamaica Observer 21/08/2024; Reuters 05/09/2024;\n\nACLED 12/08/2024). In 2024 alone, the country has declared two states of emergency: one in February, which lasted until April, and this recent one in July, which was extended in September and remains active (OCHA 24/04/2024; AJ 08/03/2024).\n\nOn 18 September, the Government established an electoral council comprising journalists, activists, representatives of farmers, religious communities and unions, and government officials. This council aims to develop the legal framework to hold elections in 2026 (Reuters 19/09/2024; AJ 19/09/2024). Democratic elections can be a step forward for Haiti, which has been without elections since 2016, but they can also generate tension and clashes between different groups interested in gaining political control of the country. This also implies a risk of increasing humanitarian needs for civilians, including children.\n\nAround 600 Kenyan police officers have been deployed in Haiti between June\u2013July 2024 under a Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission to address gang violence (Africanews 16/07/2024). On 12 September, Jamaican soldiers were deployed to Haiti to back up the Kenyan police (AP 12/09/2024; ABC 12/09/2024). Since July, the Kenyan police have concentrated on crucial defence duties, including the protection of key infrastructure, such as airports and oil terminals (FEWS NET 31/07/2024).\n\nStarting in April 2024, gang violence appeared to decrease, until ransom kidnappings and attacks on civilians surged in July as armed gangs sought to reinforce their resources and strengthen their capacity to challenge the MSS mission (ACLED 12/08/2024). As a result, forced child recruitment into armed gangs has increased significantly (BINUH 30/06/2024).\n\nOn 5 July, Jimmy \u2018Barbecue\u2019 Ch\u00e9rizier, leader of F\u00f2s Revolisyon\u00e8 G9 an Fanmi e Alye (G9 gang), publicly announced intending to lay down arms to facilitate national dialogue. On 25 July, he signed a peace treaty with the Government (EFE 06/07/2024; Kenyans 26/07/2024). There is little information about the implementations of this treaty; until 21 September, violence persisted, with reports indicating that armed gangs continued to block roads, burn homes and police stations, loot businesses, and commit acts of murder and kidnapping (DW 21/09/2024).\n\nAppointed Prime Minister Ariel Henry left the country on 11 March and formally resigned on 25 April because armed groups threatened him and blocked his return to the country. Gary Conille, a former senior UN official, was appointed to replace Henry on 3 June (Brookings 12/07/2024; BBC 26/04/2024).\n\nFurther information on Haiti\u2019s political and contextual information is available in ACAPS\u2019 Haiti: Criminal Gang Violence in Port-au-Prince.\n\nThematic report | 30 September 2024\n\nTERMINOLOGY\n\nArmed gangs are criminal groups that primarily seek to control urban areas. They are estimated to dominate 60% of PAP (AJ 13/03/2024). The most prominent is the G9 gang, a federation of nine powerful gangs in the city led by Jimmy \u2018Barbecue\u2019 Ch\u00e9rizier, a former police officer. G9 has previously been linked to past politicians as enforcers and supporters of certain governments. Their main rival is GP\u00e8p, another gang federation headed by Gabriel Jean-Pierre, mononymously known as \u2018Gabriel\u2019. Another notable group is the 5 Seconds gang. These armed gangs engage in extortion, kidnappings for ransom, and the seizure of buildings and public services (such as electricity and water), for which they demand payment for access (AJ 13/03/2024; InSight Crime 21/03/2023).\n\nSelf-defence brigades are armed civilians who aim to fill the security void left by a lack of police in some areas of the country and neighbourhoods of PAP. They have been responsible for some mob killings \u2013 the violent act of a group of people executing or attacking an individual under the pretext of administering justice \u2013 against suspected gang members (AJ 28/03/2024; ICG 03/07/2023).\n\nUnaccompanied children are children who have been separated from both parents and other relatives and are not under the care of an adult legally or traditionally responsible for them (ICRC 01/2004).\n\nSeparated children are children separated from both parents or their previous legal or customary primary caregiver but not necessarily from other relatives, meaning they are not necessarily unaccompanied (ICRC 01/2004).\n\nOrphans include any child under the age of 18 who has lost one or both parents to death. (STC 2007).\n---\nCONTEXT\n\nHaiti has experienced a series of unstable governments that has strengthened the control of armed gangs over the country. It is estimated that between 150\u2013200 armed gangs dispute territorial and social control in Haiti (UN 04/04/2024; AJ 13/03/2024). The situation has been particularly severe in PAP, Artibonite, and the southwestern communities of Carrefour and Gressier, where gangs exert significant control and influence (HT 26/08/2024; Le Monde 26/08/2024).\n\nPolitical instability deepened in 2016 when Haiti entered a political vacuum resulting from allegations of fraud against prime minister candidate Jovenel Mo\u00efse. His election sparked mass protests, and he was assassinated in 2021. Since then, two prime ministers have led the country: Ariel Henry and Gary Conille (CFR accessed 27/09/2024; ICG 23/05/2024). While democratic elections are anticipated in 2026, the current political instability and lack of coordinated authority have empowered armed gangs, severely affecting the safety, health, and development of children and creating a long-term impact on their future.\n\nMap 1. Reference map of Port Au Prince and Artibonite in Haiti\n\nSource: ACAPS using HT 26/08/2024\n\nThematic report | 30 September 2024\n\nDisplacement\n\nThe increasing control of armed gangs has resulted in heightened insecurity and violence, which has been the main driver of displacement. Between March\u2013August 2024, the violence displaced nearly 600,000 people (including children), which is three times higher than the same period in 2023 (OCHA 26/08/2024). The population of PAP has been decreasing as people leave because of the concentration of gangs in the city. In June 2024, around 80% of IDPs were residing with host families, and 20% were sheltering across more than 110 IDP sites, many of which were in schools (USAID 06/09/2024).\n\nCross-border displacement to the Dominican Republic, the US, and other countries is also increasing. This displacement is separating families; in many cases, this includes the separation of children from their parents (KII 08/08/2024; VOA 05/04/2024; Le Monde 10/03/2024).\n\nThere have been reports of the deportation and forced return of unaccompanied minors to Haiti, exposing them to human trafficking, sexual abuse, and other protection risks. Deported and repatriated children usually lack support networks when they arrive, besides facing violence, child recruitment, educational disruption, and psychological trauma (Al Momento 30/08/2024; El Pa\u00eds 28/08/2024; BBC 29/08/2023; USCRI 06/06/2024).\n\nLimitations/information gaps\n\nThere are discrepancies in the exact mortality rate in Haiti. According to the UN, there were more than 4,700 homicide victims across the country in 2023, while an independent survey reported more than 2,300 violent deaths in Cit\u00e9 Soleil alone in the same year. ACLED recorded 1,980 reported fatalities countrywide in 2023 (MSF 07/03/2024; ACLED 17/01/2024). The figures are likely even higher, with insecurity limiting the gathering of information in the country. It is also uncertain how many of the fatalities were children.\n\n2024 figures also vary depending on the source. Between 1 April and 30 June 2024, BINUH documented 1,379 victims of killing and injury, as well as 428 victims of kidnapping. Men represented 77% of victims of killing, injury and kidnapping, women 20%, and children 3% (BINUH 30/06/2024). There are no disaggregated figures of the kidnapping and injury of children in Artibonite, PAP, and countrywide.\n\nThere is little to no information on children with disabilities and little information on separated and unaccompanied children.\n---\nPROTECTION IMPACTS ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nViolence\n\nAn estimated 500,000 children in Haiti are living in neighbourhoods under the control of armed groups, putting them at higher risk of violence and child recruitment (UNICEF 04/06/2024). Children are at risk of violence from diverse perpetrators, including armed gangs and so- called self-defence brigades, mostly in neighbourhoods of PAP (KII 01/08/2024; HL 03/04/2024).\n\nBetween January\u2013June 2024, an average of five children died from the violence per week. Many were killed or injured by stray bullets, but others were targeted because of their suspected support for rival gangs or perception as police informants (STC 13/08/2024). Gangs are also increasingly recruiting children to participate in criminal activities (BINUH 30/06/2024 and 11/03/2024).\n\nThe actual number of child casualties is expected to be significantly higher because of the underreporting of casualties. It is uncertain how many cases of kidnapping countrywide involve children.\n\nMinors who leave armed gangs or are suspected of belonging to them face other significant protection risks, such as torture, degrading treatment, and stigma. Children face a high risk of killing, kidnapping, or torture, particularly in territories with the presence of armed gangs or self-defence brigades (KII 08/08/2024).\n\nForced recruitment\n\nThe exact number is unknown, but between 30\u201350% of children in Haiti are involved with armed groups (KII 08/08/2024; UNICEF 04/06/2024). Humanitarian responders suggest that the recruitment of minors to armed gangs is increasing after the deployment of the Kenyan and Jamaican MSS troops (KII 08/08/2024). Armed gangs recruit children to reinforce their ranks and solidify their role and legitimacy within communities. They offer children enlisted as soldiers work and social recognition and often distribute food or cash to their communities to gain validation and legitimacy (GITOC 24/07/2024).\n\nThere is no disaggregated information on how many of the recruited children are boys or girls, but the impact of recruitment is gendered.\n\nBoys are used as fighters more frequently than girls. Some girls and boys are used as key informants, collecting information from the national police, Kenyan army, Jamaican army,\n\nThematic report | 30 September 2024\n\nand other armed groups. They are also assigned various small tasks and duties, such as buying groceries (KII 01/08/2024; KII 08/08/2024). At the same time, there are testimonies and reports of girls joining armed groups to avoid sexual violence but who nonetheless face sexual assault upon integration into the armed groups (KII 08/08/2024).\n\nChild recruitment contributes to a cycle of violence in the country, and there is a risk that many affected children may grow up to become combatants and perpetuate further violence.\n\nSeparated, unaccompanied, and orphaned children\n\nThe violence has resulted in many children becoming separated, unaccompanied, or orphaned and dependent on aid organisations. These children are highly exposed to protection risks, such as forced recruitment, forced labour, and sexual and psychological abuse (UNICEF 02/07/2024). As of August 2024, there were approximately 30,000 orphaned children registered in Haiti, some of whom had lost both parents while others had only one parent who could not take care of them (Heartline Haiti 10/08/2024; Lumos 09/10/2017). In 2023, there were 750 orphanages in Haiti, over 500 of which were in PAP alone. The exact number of orphans in PAP and Artibonite is unknown (AP 12/06/2023; Ashley et al. 13/11/2019).\n\nThere is little information on separated and unaccompanied children in Haiti, their needs, and the impact of conflict in their lives. According to local organisations, most unaccompanied children tend to be on the borders of Haiti. Being alone makes them more vulnerable to forced recruitment from armed gangs and sexual violence (KII 08/08/2024). Unaccompanied and separated children are often displaced in situations with little access to services, such as education, healthcare, nutrition, and safe spaces (UNICEF 02/07/2024).\n\nDetention\n\nBy the end of June 2023, the Centre for the Rehabilitation of Minors in Conflict with the Law, located in the commune of Delmas (part of the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince), became the only functional detention centre in the capital after gang attacks on the National Penitentiary in PAP and the Croix-des Bouquets prison in early March 2024. Since then, new inmates arrested in the capital have been held in this centre. By June, it had reached four times its capacity, with 230 inmates sharing a space built to accommodate only 60 minors. Currently, there are adults (men and women) detained with minors (boys and girls) in the same compound (BINUH 30/06/2024). These overcrowded conditions increase protection risks, particularly for boys and girls, whom adults in detention are likely to attack or harass. There is also an increased risk of sexual violence.\n---\nGender-based violence\n\nSexual violence is often used as a weapon of war, mainly as a tactic to instil fear and seize social and territorial control (UNFPA 26/06/2024). Around 1.2 million women and girls need protection from GBV (UNFPA 28/03/2024). Since June 2024, different international and regional NGOs have expressed concerns about increasing cases of sexual violence against women and girls in several neighbourhoods and IDP sites in PAP. Groups of armed men often attack women and girls as they travel on foot or by public transport to get to work or school. There have been cases of children as young as three years old being raped in their homes or IDP sites (BINUH 30/06/2024). The consequences for children can be severe, including unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Girls are frequently forced to drop out of school, resulting in social exclusion and limiting their future opportunities (STC accessed 13/09/2024; IRC 22/08/2023).\n\nFrom January\u2013May 2024, 839 (over 20%) of the 3,949 survivors of reported GBV incidents across the country were minors (796 girls and 43 boys) (Protection Cluster/MCFDF 25/07/2024). Between April\u2013June, humanitarian organisations reported receiving an average of 40 rape survivors (not only children) per day in PAP alone (BINUH 30/06/2024).\n\nMost GBV survivors are IDPs (43% living in the community and 18% in displacement sites). Between January\u2013May, 66% of the cases were perpetrated by armed gang members and 45% by someone in the same household (Protection Cluster/MCFDF 25/07/2024). The number of sexual abuse cases is likely higher given the underreporting of GBV cases, mainly out of fear of being revictimised and stigmatised and the lack of an effective justice system (KII 08/08/2024; UNFPA 26/06/2024).\n\nAccess to health services after sexual violence is scarce in Haiti. According to the GBV Cluster, from January\u2013February, only 3% of rape cases (including adults and minors) were treated within 72 hours of the incident because of access constraints, a lack of medicine, and inadequate resources to support case management and referrals (OCHA 25/03/2024). There are many challenges for survivors, including the insecurity in the country blocking access to safe spaces, the inadequacy or absence of care facilities, and the lack of trained staff. Some survivors do not press charges for fear of reprisal. Legal services are expensive, and there are no resources to support the courts (Protection Cluster/MCFDF 25/07/2024).\n\nThematic report | 30 September 2024\n\nSECONDARY IMPACTS Education\n\nBy June 2024, approximately 156,000 students had already lost a substantial portion of their academic year because of school closures and violence. Some of these children have experienced education disruptions on several occasions \u2013 such as in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2022, when gang-related violence blocked education access for 500,000 children (UNICEF 06/05/2022).\n\nMany schools in the capital city remain either closed or inaccessible because of gang violence (UNICEF 06/05/2022). By 11 September 2024, at least 919 schools in Artibonite and western departments had been closed since January. Many schools also serve as IDP sites, while others are under the control of gangs as coordination bases or housing (UN 11/09/2024; OCHA 27/08/2024; EI 26/04/2024). Even when education is available in some areas of the country, children struggle to focus and concentrate because of trauma and a lack of sleep from sleepless nights punctuated by gunfire (AP 12/05/2024).\n\nThe new school year was delayed from September, and is expected to start on 1 October. By 14 September, humanitarian responders and the Haitian authorities were still trying to find a relocation site for IDPs, as around 30 schools in PAP were being used as IDP shelters (OCHA 14/09/2024 and 27/08/2024). If the Government is unable to relocate IDPs and violence persists, it is likely that education in PAP will continue to be disrupted for many children (VBI 17/09/2024). Those that will be able to attend school are expected to face overcrowded classroom conditions, with some classes expected to double the number of students to 80 (STC 26/09/2024). There are some online courses available for children unable to attend school, but these are only accessible to those who can afford Wi-Fi and a generator. Most Haitians spend a lot of time in the dark without electricity because of chronic power outages (AP 12/05/2024).\n\nDisruptions to education also prevent children\u2019s access to school feeding programmes implemented under the Government\u2019s national school feeding policy and strategy (WFP 15/03/2024). WFP, the largest implementer of this programme, was providing school meals to 420,000 children across Haiti until 29 January 2024 (WFP 29/01/2024 and 02/04/2024; MENFP 01/2016). The exact impact of increased insecurity since March on this programme is unclear, although WFP reported providing 163,500 children with school meals that month, representing a reduction from January that may be attributable to the increased insecurity (WFP 16/04/2024). It is likely that access to meals has drastically decreased because of the school closures resulting from insecurity, leaving children without reliable sources of nutrition.\n---\nEducation is often a coping mechanism for children to escape violence, meaning school closures further constrain their ability to cope. The lack of education is expected to have a long-term impact not only on children but also on the country\u2019s development and economic growth (KII 01/08/2024; UNICEF 06/05/2022). It has also forced some children to start working to support their families, with an increase in cases of forced child labour being observed countrywide at a rate of 13% (PI 19/08/2024). Other children have been forced to join armed gangs, as was the case in 2022 when violence also increased (UNICEF 06/05/2022).\n\nMental health and psychosocial needs\n\nThe effects of war on children are both physical and psychological, with trauma from conflict often having long-lasting consequences. Children and adolescents have reported feeling unsafe in shelters and experiencing anxiety and fear because of violence, threats, and attacks from armed groups. They are also increasingly worried about robberies, kidnappings, and disappearances linked to human trafficking (KII 08/08/2024; PI 19/08/2024). Children who have survived sexual abuse and family separation are also in need of psychosocial support (UNFPA 26/06/2024).\n\nMany children have been exposed to the violence, and it has become normalised in their lives, causing trauma, agitation, and the belief that violence is acceptable. This pattern is likely to perpetuate generational violence (KII 08/08/2024; AP 12/05/2024).\n\nThere is a shortage of humanitarian aid for mental health and psychosocial support to address the current needs of communities (KII 08/08/2024). The lack of health workers prevents children from accessing proper care and causes further mental health issues and trauma; in September alone, OCHA registered 3,493 newly displaced children (including 2,264 girls) in need of psychological support (OCHA 14/09/2024).\n\nThematic report | 30 September 2024\n\nAGGRAVATING FACTORS Food insecurity and malnutrition Map 2. Projected mapping of food insecurity from October 2024 to January\n\nSource: FEWS NET (31/07/2024)\n---\nIn March 2024, 50% of the population (around five million people) faced Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity levels. 1.6 million of these faced Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels (WFP 26/08/2024; IPC 22/03/2024). Almost 125,000 children experienced severe acute malnutrition in July, a 20% increase compared with the start of the year (FAO 11/09/2024). The areas facing the highest food insecurity are also the same ones more affected by violence, such as Artibonite Valley, rural Grand\u2019Anse, La Gonave, the transverse part of Ouest department, and some neighbourhoods of Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Croix-des-Bouquets, and PAP (IPC 22/03/2024). According to testimonies, many people are able to eat only once a day (PI 19/08/2024).\n\nFood insecurity increases children\u2019s vulnerability to diseases and hampers their ability to learn as they struggle to stay awake and alert. This issue affects both their physical and psychological health, as well as their overall development (Gallegos et al. 26/08/2021).\n\nSince February, increasing insecurity has constrained the delivery of aid, particularly food. This has significantly increased communities\u2019 vulnerability to food insecurity and malnutrition, affecting not only urban but also rural areas that have also come to host IDPs (FAO 10/09/2024). Some farmers have had to abandon their land, especially in Artibonite, because of escalating violence. This has reduced agricultural production and the distribution of goods, in particular, supplies to markets (USAID 06/09/2024; FEWS NET 31/07/2024).\n\nHealth\n\nHealthcare access, particularly in PAP, remains extremely limited. Many hospitals have closed or reduced their operations because of medicine and staff shortages (UNFPA 26/06/2024). According to the Ministry of Health, 40% of facilities providing beds for patient care in PAP, including the country\u2019s main university hospital, have closed since May 2024 because of insecurity and looting by armed gangs (UN 01/07/2024).\n\nOrganisations have been delivering some vaccines, but insecurity across the country prevents children from accessing vaccination and other health services (UNICEF 27/08/2024). This can increase the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B.\n\nThe lack of access to antenatal care and safe delivery facilities raises the risk of maternal complications and increases neonatal mortality. According to UNFPA, the closure of hospitals and health facilities has left approximately 3,000 pregnant women in the capital city without maternal health services, while over 84,000 pregnant women nationwide are unable to access secure health services. This situation endangers both women and their babies. Many are at risk of complications and need emergency obstetric care, including Caesarean sections that can only be performed in health facilities (UN 28/06/2024U; UNFPA\n\nThematic report | 30 September 2024\n\n28/03/2024). Living in conflict also affects infant feeding because stress and poor nutrition can affect a mother\u2019s capacity to breastfeed. Around 26,800 pregnant and breastfeeding women face acute malnutrition across the country (IPC 08/03/2024).\n\nHaiti has been dealing with a resurgence of cholera since October 2022. Between January\u2013 July 2024, the country reported over 2,670 cases of the disease and 13 related deaths (WHO 15/08/2024). In August 2024, there were over 88,000 suspected cases of cholera countrywide. Since October 2022, when the country declared the current cholera outbreak, there have been over 86,600 suspected cases, 4,800 confirmed cases, and 1,300 deaths, mostly in Grand\u2019Anse, Nippes, Ouest, and Sud-Est departments (UNICEF 27/08/2024). Children who experience malnutrition are usually more vulnerable to illness as their immune systems may be weaker. In the first month of the cholera outbreak, children under the age of 14 accounted for almost half of the 1,700 suspected cases (UNICEF 24/10/2022).\n\nThe risk of cholera and waterborne diseases increases between August and mid-November, when the country is expected to experience light to moderate rain (FEWS NET 04/09/2024; ClimeChart accessed 10/09/2024).\n\nHurricane and exposure to climate hazards\n\nThe country\u2019s exposure to environmental hazards aggravates the situation, with more than 96% of the population exposed to natural hazard-related shocks. Some communities are still recovering from previous shocks, such as the magnitude-7.2 earthquake that hit in 2021 (Dawn 13/09/2023). In September 2024, the country experienced rainfall deficits between 5\u201360% of the average in northern and southern Haiti, which is likely to affect crops and vegetation (FEWS NET 19/09/2024).\n\nHaiti is poorly prepared for and lacks effective mitigation strategies for extreme weather events. Having already experienced heavy rainfall in the early months of 2024, the country is at heightened risk during the current hurricane season, which extends through November in the Caribbean. In October, the country is forecast to experience around 17\u201325 weather- related events (including four to seven hurricanes) (FAO 10/09/2024; IRI accessed 27/08/2024). The current insecurity and instability make displaced people, including children, more vulnerable to the effects of climate hazards (STC 20/06/2024).\n\nExposure to climate events can have a negative impact on children\u2019s health. Hurricanes and other extreme weather events can lead to physical injuries or increase the incidence of diseases, such as diarrhoea, dengue fever, and malaria. Extreme events usually affect crops and cattle, reducing household incomes and frequently causing food prices to rise. This often affects household food security and children\u2019s nutritional intake (ODID 01/06/2023).\n---\nPoverty\n\nHaiti remains the poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean and among the poorest in the world (WB accessed 27/09/2024). People are highly reliant on remittances for food (PI 19/08/2024). Haiti\u2019s deep poverty facilitates convincing children to take up arms or work as informants or armed group members (The Guardian 23/08/2024).\n\nRESPONSE CAPACITY AND ACCESS CONSTRAINTS\n\n\u2022 Numerous checkpoints set up by heavily armed gangs along National Roads 1, 2, and 3 constrain access in PAP and Artibonite (BINUH 30/06/2024). This limits the humanitarian response to civilians, including children.\n\nThere are many challenges that constrain access to children recruited by armed gangs. Armed groups usually do not allow humanitarian assistance, mostly in Artibonite and some areas of PAP (KII 08/08/2024). That said, some humanitarian responders have been able to negotiate with various gangs for access to children and to sensitise them about violence prevention and recruitment (KII 01/08/2024).\n\nRadio is the primary source of news, with numerous regional and privately owned stations available. The sponsorship of private entities, however, can be detrimental to the objectivity of information, as their interests can influence news. At the same time, journalists face threats and other challenges to information gathering in all areas of the country (BINUH 30/06/2024; BBC 21/05/2024; VOA 05/04/2024).\n\nJudicial personnel have faced intimidation and attacks, impeding their ability to perform their duties and compromising their neutrality. Between April\u2013June, at least five judges and lawyers were killed or injured in Artibonite and Nord departments (BINUH 30/06/2024).

The Directorate General of Civil Protection (DGPC) and the IOM\u2019s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) have been conducting periodic assessments of locations hosting displaced populations since August 2022. Data is collected through direct observations as well as interviews with key informants at the lowest administrative level, which is the neighborhood in the Metropolitan Area of Port-au-Prince (MAPAP) and the communal section outside the MAPAP.\n\n\u2713The last round of these assessments (Round 7 \u2013 published in June 2024) had indicated that 578,074 people were internally displaced in Haiti. This new round indicates the presence of 702,973 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), almost 22% more than in Round 7. The armed attacks in the municipality of Gressier (located in the West department, outside the MAPAP) are the main reason for this increase; this municipality has been almost emptied of its population following these attacks and has become the second municipality of origin for IDPs in the country whereas it was in 5th position during Round 7.\n\n\u2713A slight decrease (6%) in the number of IDPs was observed in the MAPAP, reflecting the continuation of displacement from the capital to provinces but in smaller proportions compared to the period of March-April 2024. Returns of some IDPs was also observed, in particular in certain neighborhoods of the municipality of Cit\u00e9 Soleil (see section on returnees).\n\n\u2713The MAPAP currently hosts a quarter of the country's IDPs, compared to about a third during the previous Round (25% in Round 8 vs 32% in Round 7).\n\n\u2713 Provinces host 75% of the country's IDPs. In particular, the Great South (departments of South, Grande'Anse, South- East and Nippes) hosts almost half of all IDPs: 45% of the country's IDPs are hosted in these 4 departments.\n\n\u2713 The West Department, particularly the MAPAP, is the place of origin of the vast majority of IDPs in all departments. The only exception is Artibonite, where 56% of IDPs fled from areas within the same department..\n\n\u2713 At the national level, the majority of IDPs are hosted in host families/out of sites: 83% (vs 17% in sites). However, in the MAPAP the majority of IDPs reside in sites (63% in sites vs. 37% in host families/out of sites), while in provinces the opposite is true (98% in host families/out of sites vs. 2% in sites).\n\n\u271365,535 returnees formerly IDPs were identified, particularly in the commune of Cit\u00e9 Soleil where a 151% increase in the number of returnees was observed. It should be noted that for the moment these returns remain very fragile and are not sustainable, particularly in the MAPAP. Indeed, returnees are often displaced again following new attacks in their return area: in the MAPAP, 52% of IDPs have already been displaced more than once and these repeated movements include new displacements after having returned home (see the report on displacement dynamics for more details).\n\n1,042 3,688 assessed locations interviewed key informants\n\nInternally Displaced Persons (IDPs)\n\n702,973 Internally Displaced Persons\n\n170,255 Displaced households\n\n+22%\n\nIncrease in the number of IDPs compared to Round 6\n\n83% of IDPs in host families / out of sites\n\n17% in sites sites\n\nin MAPAP (1 less compared to Round 7) in province (+4 compared to Round 7)\n\n54% of IDPs are women (adults and minors) IDPs\u2019 period of displacement <1% 4% 4% Before 2021 2022 Returnees formerly IDPs\n\n52% of IDPs are children 27% 65% 2023 2024\n\n65,535 31% more than 15,980 in Round 7 Returned persons Returned households\n\nINTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATIONS Website: https://dtm.iom.int/haiti Contact: dtmhaiti@iom.int\n---\nDisplacement situation in Haiti \u2013 September 2024 IDPs\u2019 AGE AND SEX DISAGGREGATION Figure 1.

The slight decrease in IDPs\u2019 number can be explained by the continued departures of people leaving the capital to go to provinces and by the return of IDPs in certain areas of the MAPAP, particularly in Cit\u00e9 Soleil (see page 20 for more details).\n\nLa citation The following suivante est citation requise is required lors de when l\u2019utilisation using the des data donn\u00e9es and information et informations included incluses in this dans report: ce rapport \u201cInternational : \u00ab Organisation Organization Internationale for pour les Migration Migrations (IOM), (OIM), September septembre 2024, 2024, DTM Evaluations Assessment de of la situation the displacement de d\u00e9placement situation en in Ha\u00efti.

Most sites in the MAPAP are located in the municipality of Port-au-Prince (60 of the 95 sites are located in this municipality). 89% of all IDPs in this municipality are hosted in sites, and 11% are in host families/out of sites (see Figure 19 on the next page).\n\nWhen significant displacement started to happen in the MAPAP in 2022, most IDPs were hosted in host families: by the end of 2022, only a quarter of all IDPs were in sites. A year later, by the end of 2023, the situation had reversed, with the majority of IDPs residing in sites (58%). This trend continued in 2024 and currently, more than 6 out of 10 IDPs reside in sites (63%) (see Figure 17).\n\nThe growing insecurity restricting possibilities to seek refuge with relatives, the lack of resources of host families to accommodate IDPs for a relatively long period of time, and the deterioration of social cohesion, are the main reasons for this. Surveys carried out by the DTM among displaced households and host communities in the country have shown that tensions and conflicts between IDPs and host communities are more frequent in the MAPAP than in the provinces.\n\nIDPs in sites represent the category of households that most often reports the existence of tensions or conflicts with host communities.

This increase is due to the displacement of people who fled the municipality of Gressier, which has become, along with Port-au-Prince, the main place of origin for IDPs in the Great South, particularly those living in the Southeast (see Figures 34 and 35).\n\nThis region is the leading host region for IDPs in the country, hosting nearly half of the country's IDPs (45%).
