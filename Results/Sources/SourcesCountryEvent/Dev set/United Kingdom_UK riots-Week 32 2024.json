In Rotherham, South Yorkshire, asylum seekers were trapped in their accommodation as rioters smashed windows and set the building on fire.\nThe riots are being fueled by racist and Islamophobic misinformation shared online, which should focus policymakers\u2019 minds on how easily social media platforms can be harnessed to promote hate. The misguided and ignorant interventions of X, formerly known as Twitter, owner Elon Musk should also raise serious questions about how these platforms are managed, with parliamentarians suggesting Musk be called in to answer questions.\nIt is understandable many people in the UK are angry and frustrated that their living standards continue to decline and that they feel neglected or forgotten as local facilities close, benefits are cut, and funding to services is slashed.

Even in the midst of this situation, Conservative leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick made Islamophobic comments that risk fanning the flames. By adopting the rhetoric of the far right, politicians have sanitized and mainstreamed Islamophobia and xenophobia, emboldening extremists. The willingness, indeed eagerness, of some media to vilify and demonize certain communities and groups has also made this possible. When the government conducts a postmortem of the riots, it should not ignore the role politicians and media played in stoking fear, mistrust, and hostility towards these groups.\nThe new Labour government inherits a country divided, in which the far right is a real and present danger. But to focus solely on the violent disorder is to treat the symptom of a much broader problem. To tackle the threat posed by the far right, the government needs not only to hold to account those spewing dehumanizing rhetoric and address ongoing structural racism and Islamophobia, but also begin to address the many and varied structural issues, including rising inequality and poverty, that are ripe for cynical exploitation to push a xenophobic agenda", "19178": "title: UK slams 'deeply irresponsible' Musk comments on riots \n content: UK slams \u2018deeply irresponsible\u2019 Musk comments on riots\nLONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) \u2014 A UK government minister on Tuesday slammed American tech billionaire Elon Musk for his \u201cunacceptable\u201d comments on social media about far-right riots gripping England and Northern Ireland.\nThe owner of X drew criticism for writing on the site on Sunday that a British \u201ccivil war\u201d was inevitable.

This incident saw 51 police officers injured as they tried to keep rioters out \u2013 a particularly high casualty event for law enforcement in a medium-sized English town.\nOther factors have distinguished the violence: its overtly racist nature; the occasional presence of women and children; and the extent and apparent spontaneity of the disorder as it is quickly organised on social media platforms.\nBut while long-time far-right extremists are suspected of being key organisers, a potent and long-simmering mix of prejudice in the UK has been blamed as an underlying factor for the unrest. Xenophobic and bigoted views, particularly against Muslims and asylum seekers, have become more normalised in the country, with lies and conspiracy theories often repeated by senior ministers in the former Conservative government and some mainstream media outlets.\nSocial media has come under particular scrutiny, with X, formerly known as Twitter, having played a prominent role. The platform, along with others, was used to spread the lies which preceded the first riots: a false name for the Southport attacker \u2018Ali al-Shakati\u2019 was mentioned more than 30,000 times on X one day after the murders, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\nOwner Elon Musk has fanned the flames, writing on X that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in the UK.

It is, as Sir Keir Starmer clearly intends, imperative that they are swiftly seen to suffer the consequences of such thuggery in court.\nIt will not, however, be sufficient to address these events primarily through the legal lens of violent disorder and criminality. In Southport and places such as Sunderland and Stoke, hundreds of rioters, mobilised through social media, brought the spirit of the far-right pogrom to the streets of our towns and cities. In Middlesbrough, masked youths targeted an area with a large immigrant population, smashing the windows of houses and car windscreens. These actions were a challenge to Britain\u2019s peaceful multi-ethnic identity.\nAs Dame Sara Khan, the independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience under Rishi Sunak, told this newspaper, that did not come about in a political vacuum. According to Ms Khan\u2019s own research, the inflammatory rhetoric deployed by successive Conservative governments in relation to immigration has palpably nourished extremism on the ground. \u201cYou just see extremists co-opting that,\u201d she notes. \u201cYou see people saying, well, if politicians can use that language, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Nigel Farage\u2019s insidious manipulation of social media is further contributing to this merging of horizons between Reform, parts of a radicalised Conservative party and the extra-parliamentary far right.\nThankfully, the likes of Suella Braverman, who as home secretary described irregular migration as an \u201cinvasion\u201d and later suggested that \u201cIslamists\u201d were now running Britain, will not be in office anytime soon. But the pious condemnation of the violence by senior Conservative figures sits uneasily with their party\u2019s relentless framing of immigration as a menace to the nation. It also leaves Labour with a task that goes far beyond the rapid administering of criminal justice in the courts.\nAs Ms Khan argues, ineffective legislation permits pernicious racist narratives to be freely propagated, particularly on social media. This lacuna in our extremism laws must finally be addressed. Just as importantly, the mainstreaming and normalisation of far-right discourse on immigration in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, is a political fact that requires a response. The reality of Britain as a multicultural society needs to be defended and celebrated, both rhetorically and through the provision of real resources and support to challenged areas.\nAs has been said many times in the aftermath of Southport, the overwhelming majority of Britons will view the events of the past few days with utter revulsion. But the riots are also evidence that the ideas of the far right have gained much more than a foothold in our national politics. It will perhaps be the most important task of this new Labour government to take them on.", "25142": "title: British PM says \u2018standing army\u2019 of police ready to deal with rioters \n content: British PM says \u2018standing army\u2019 of police ready to deal with rioters\nKeir Starmer says violent protesters who target Muslim communities would face \u2018full force of the law\u2019 as he blames misinformation for the riots.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer says a \u201cstanding army\u201d of specialist police would be set up as he promises \u201cswift criminal sanctions\u201d to check violent riots that have broken out in the country over the past week.\nStarmer convened an emergency meeting on Monday with ministers and police chiefs, including Scotland Yard boss Mark Rowley, to discuss how to quell the violence that first broke out in Southport in northwest England on Tuesday.\nKeep readinglist of 4 items\nFar-right riots flare in another UK city amid anti-immigrant protests\nFar-right protesters clash with police in UK cities as unrest spreads\nUK braces for more far-right protests as gov\u2019t warns of tough response\nHe blamed the lawlessness on far-right activists and misinformation on social media that has whipped up anger over a stabbing attack at a dance class last week that killed three girls.\nFalse rumours spread online that the suspect was a Muslim and an asylum-seeker, leading to attacks on immigrants and Muslims.\nPolice said the 17-year-old suspect was born in the United Kingdom and they are not treating the stabbings as a terrorist incident.\nStarmer said a \u201cstanding army\u201d of specially trained police officers was ready to be deployed to support local forces where any further riots break out.\n\u201cWhatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest.

Far-right groups on social media had called for protests to target visa processing centers and immigration lawyers\u2019 offices at more than 100 sites around the country at 8 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET).\nBut by the early evening, thousands of counter-protesters had gathered at more than a dozen cities to guard the immigration centers and prevent them being targeted by the far right.\nWhether Wednesday\u2019s counter-protests represent a turning point is not yet clear, but fears of another night of unrest have abated for now. The fizzling out of the planned protests will come as a major relief for the new Labour government, and for communities that had prepared for the worst.\nIt may also be a sign that many have been deterred from taking to the streets, after previous far-right protests turned violent and hundreds of rioters were arrested over the weekend, with some already receiving prison sentences.\nIn Walthamstow, east London, the immigration center was entirely boarded up, protected by a heavy police presence and surrounded by around three or four thousand counter-protesters.\n\u201cWe today have got such brilliant numbers in our community,\u201d an organizer shouted through a megaphone to a hastily organized crowd. \u201cWe have shown them whose streets these really are.

There was no particular buildup, no clearly discernible pressure-cooker process\u201d (Starmer is being tough on the rioters, but history shows that preventing further unrest is the real challenge, 7 August). I find this unbelievable. People have been warning for years that the relentless triangulation of Nigel Farage and Reform by both the Tory party and the Labour party would eventually open the door for the far right.\nThe drift to the right has been across the board in UK politics since Margaret Thatcher. If not, then could someone please explain why Labour were so uncritical of the immorality of the entire \u201cstop the boats\u201d gimmick? And why go so far themselves in the same direction, promising they could indeed stop the boats, but with border control?\nThere has been no pushback whatsoever against the frankly racist campaign to demonise refugees and Muslims. Instead, we have seen centrist strategists enthusiastically endorsing the triangulation of both the right of the Conservative party and, shamefully, the more unhinged rantings of Reform.\nThese riots come as no surprise to me. We have a mainstream political culture that those people who fought against the rise of the National Front and the BNP in the 1970s and 80s would be utterly ashamed of. They would have seen and called out the debased adoption by all parties of \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d for the racist nonsense it so clearly always was and still is.\nJonathan Callan\nLondon\nDespite the Kaiser Chiefs song, Martin Kettle is right that you can\u2019t predict a riot. The appalling attack on young girls in Southport and misinformation about it appears to have been a spark. However, the previous Saturday, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon and others had held a rally of 15,000 in London. It was opposed by a large Stand Up to Racism presence, but it was obvious trouble would be brewing at some point.\nKettle is right too that Britain has a long history of riots. The Church and King mobs of the late 18th and early 19th centuries violently attacked the houses and meetings of radicals and religious dissenters. They were inspired, just as the current riots seem to be, by ideas formulated not at the grassroots but at the top of society. In the early 1800s these focused on opposition to the French Revolution and to any democratic instincts such as the demand for the vote. The mother of William Hulton, the magistrate who sent the yeomanry in at Peterloo in August 1819, owned a prize horse. Its name? Church and King.\nDr Keith Flett\nEditor, A History of Riots\nMartin Kettle is right to draw attention to the longer term. So far Sir Keir Starmer has held a strong line in making clear that these rioters are engaging in criminal acts and will be punished. However, locking people up for a relatively short time does not deal with the root causes, and may lead to even more embittered individuals on release. If only the punishment for each could be to be \u201clocked into\u201d a programme that helps them to explore their anger and maybe even become advocates for peace.\nElspeth Cardy\nLondon\nViolent rioters are being jailed. The prisons are full. Here is an alternative. The government could start up a scheme similar to the Voluntary Service Overseas. Those who choose this as an alternative to prison are sent on a programme of providing aid where it is needed, in countries which are open to it.\nGiven that hatred largely stems from ignorance, boredom, frustration, poverty and fear, this could have the added value of showing the participants other cultures, and that difference does not necessarily have to be something to be afraid of.\nWould James Timpson, our new prisons minister, be interested in backing such a project?\nCaroline Stewart\nGlasgow", "26734": "title: Piers Morgan calls out Elon Musk for \u2018all communities\u2019 comment amid far-right riots \n content: Piers Morgan calls out Elon Musk for \u2018all communities\u2019 comment amid far-right riots\nCritics have called for a travel ban on the billionaire tech owner as he is accused of causing waves \u2018at a very dangerous time\u2019\nSupport truly\nindependent journalism\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\nLouise Thomas\nEditor\nPiers Morgan has hit out at Elon Musk over his inflammatory remarks about Britain\u2019s ongoing race riots.\nViolent disorder has spread across the country in the wake of the stabbings of three young girls in Southport, after misinformation spread that the killer was a Muslim asylum seeker.\nHundreds of people have been arrested, with thousands of police officers deployed to prepare for further actions throughout the week.

The suspect accused of the killings was born in Britain.\nTraditionally, the monarch does not comment on anything that could cause political controversy.\nBut in calls with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and police chiefs, the king said he had been \"greatly encouraged\" by the reaction \"that countered the aggression and criminality from a few with the compassion and resilience of the many\".\nWhile extra police have been put on standby, there have been many counter-demonstrations in cities where far-right protests had been planned.\n'Perilous moment'\nHis call for unity followed a silence that had concerned some royal watchers.\n\"I am surprised that the king as head of state hasn't come out more forcefully, given that it's a perilous moment for the United Kingdom,\" historian and royal commentator Ed Owens said before the statement's release.\nAccording to constitutional law expert Craig Prescott, however, \"the monarchy does not comment on current political events\".

The question of \"illegal migration\" is politically divisive and sensitive in Britain, said Owens.\nBut as heir to the throne, Charles made known his opposition to the previous government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.\nAnd the king has been more vocal about topics such as climate change over the years. Since becoming the monarch he is seen as having presented himself as more accessible than his predecessors, including by opening up about his health.\nBut for Graham Smith, head of Republic, a pressure group which campaigns for an elected UK head of state to replace the monarch, the lack of a response to the riots showed that the monarchy is an institution \"for someone who isn't able to speak really\".\nAccording to media reports, quoting palace sources, the king has asked for a daily update on the crisis.\nBut Smith said: \"There's no value in a billionaire sitting in his holiday home being updated about what's happening.

The U.K.\u2019s Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday condemned the violence as \"far-right thuggery,\" pledging swift prosecution of those involved.\nHundreds of extremist demonstrators have attacked police and set fire to mosques and shops, with hundreds of masked individuals rampaging through city centers.\nIn the northern English town of Rotherham on Sunday, a mob of hundreds of people attacked a hotel that was housing asylum seekers.

It is organised, violent thuggery.\u201d\nThe unrest has quickly overshadowed plans Starmer rolled out when he came to power last month after his Labour Party swept Conservatives out of office in a landslide.\nThe new government wanted to focus on getting a sluggish economy moving and fixing public services, such as Britain\u2019s revered national healthcare system, that have been hobbled by deep cuts following the 2008 financial crisis, said Patrick Diamond, a public policy professor at Queen Mary University of London.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t ideally want to be dealing with these kinds of identity conflicts,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cI think the protests, the riots are undoubtedly uncomfortable. Governments have plans when they come to office but they often get blown off course and this is another demonstration of that.\u201d\nDiamond, who was a policy adviser to the previous two Labour prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, likened it to the crisis Brown faced when he found his agenda swamped by a flooding crisis when he took office in 2007.\nStarmer, who was chief prosecutor for England and Wales during the last major outbreak of riots in 2011, has responded with a message of reassurance that communities will be kept safe and perpetrators will be harshly punished.\nHe has also announced plans to create a \u201cstanding army\u201d of specialist police to deal with rioting and improve communication and cooperation between law enforcement agencies, as mobs of protesters are believed to be travelling to different towns to stir up trouble.\nOne of the political issues facing Starmer is whether he\u2019s seen to be in control of events and is using the whole government in response, effectively providing public services and dealing with issues of community cohesion, Diamond said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important early test of the ministers,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cAre they in control of the crisis or is the crisis in control of them?\u201d\nSo far, Starmer\u2019s main political foes have been united in condemning the violence and there hasn\u2019t been much criticism of his response.\nJames Cleverly, the former Conservative home secretary, has said the government should have been quicker in its response to the riots. He has also questioned the purpose and need for the so-called army of police Starmer has called for.\nNigel Farage, leader of the right-wing populist Reform UK party, which only has five seats in Parliament despite winning 14 per cent of the vote, has been widely criticised for making the divisive claim that rioters are subject to \u201ctwo-tier policing\u201d and are treated more harshly than others, such as Black Lives Matter protesters.\nA large fiscal shortfall could complicate efforts to respond to the crisis as Starmer\u2019s government pledges to pay police overtime, potentially hold night and weekend court sessions to deal with an influx of cases from the mayhem, and make space in an already overcrowded prison system for more than 500 additional inmates.\nOn the day of the stabbings in the northeast seaside town of Southport, Treasury Secretary Rachel Reeves had announced what she said was a newly discovered \u00a322 billion (US$28 billion) \u201cblack hole\u201d in public finances left by the previous administration.", "30753": "title: UK riots: Shock as young girl shouts racist abuse while holding hands with adult in Belfast street \n content: UK riots: Shock as young girl shouts racist abuse while holding hands with adult in Belfast street\nVideo shows young girl repeatedly shouting \u201cP***s out\u201d while skipping down the street\nSupport truly\nindependent journalism\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\nLouise Thomas\nEditor\nA video circulating on social media showing a girl shouting racial slurs in the street while holding hands with an adult has attracted widespread condemnation.\nIn the footage, a girl can be seen skipping down the street holding the arm of an older woman as she repeatedly chants \u201cP***s out\u201d ahead of an anti-immigration demonstration in Belfast.\nThe woman filming the clip can be heard challenging them as she accuses the older woman of teaching the girl racism.\n\"It is really embarrassing that you would bring your child and let them say something like that.

It is essential that the wider public help us with this by telling us what they know about those involved in this disorder.\u201d\nJoe Mulhall, director of research at Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cWe have been appalled to see evidence of parents bringing their children to watch horrifying scenes of far-right violence at numerous events over this past week.\n\u201cThere have also been examples of young people involved in rioting and racist chanting. Some of those involved will find themselves in serious legal trouble.

Instead, he was emotionally traumatised.\n\"At the moment, I do not feel targeted... even if you do not feel targeted, you could be a target because you do not know the intent of the other person in the bus, at the bus station, while walking or passing by a handful of people,\" he said.\nThis calm was short-lived.

We are good people and we behave ourselves in an orderly manner in this country and should not be made to feel unsafe or suffer,\" he added.\nAlthough Mrs Oyindamola sympathises with the loss of the young girls, she believes it is being used as a cover to act on existing grievances.\n\"A lot of Brits are of the notion that immigrants come here free, get all the jobs, stay in five-star hotels and take all the benefits,\" she noted.\nShe said she is comforted by her British friends, who have condemned the ongoing violence. \"We will continue to be upstanding members of society and hope to be accorded the same respect and dignity.\"\nWhile the protests continue to spread across different cities, the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has assured the public that offenders will be made to face the law.\n\"I utterly condemn the far-right thuggery we have seen this weekend.

However, Labour under Starmer faces significant criticism for its handling of the crisis.\nThe survey reveals that the vast majority of Britons oppose the riots. An overwhelming 85pc of respondents denounce the violent unrest, with 7pc expressing support. Even the broader peaceful protests only garner support from one-third of the population (34pc), while over half (54pc) are against them. This opposition is widespread across all voter groups, with even Reform UK voters, the most supportive group, showing only 21pc approval for the riots.\nOnly 8pc of Britons resonate with the rioters\u2019 views. Moreover, the public firmly believes that the rioters do not represent the majority, with 76pc asserting they do not reflect the views of most Britons.\nYouGov poll finds over one-third of Britons agree with far-right being characterised as \u2018thugs\u2019\nKeir Starmer\u2019s characterisation of the rioters as \u201cfar-right thugs\u201d has sparked debate. However, a significant portion of the public agrees with this description. Two-thirds (67pc) find the term \u2018thugs\u2019 appropriate, and 52pc support labeling them as \u2018far-right\u2019. Yet, the public remains divided on whether the rioters should be considered \u2018terrorists\u2019, with only 23pc endorsing this label.\nThe survey also indicates dissatisfaction with Labour\u2019s management of the crisis. Only 31pc believe that Keir Starmer is handling the riots well, whereas nearly half (49pc) think he is doing poorly. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper fares similarly, with 23pc approving her handling of the situation against 43pc who disapprove. Labour and Lib Dem voters tend to have a positive view of how well Starmer and Cooper are handling the crisis, while Conservative and Reform UK voters are generally critical\nWhile a slight majority (52pc) believe the police are handling the riots well, confidence in their ability to prevent further violence is low. Only 38pc express confidence in the police\u2019s capacity to protect people and property.\nDeployment, convictions\nThe government, only one month old, has vowed to take a tough line on the unrest.\nAt least 6,000 specialist police are on standby to deal with the disorder, which has seen more than 425 people arrested and at least 120 charged, according to latest police figures.\nA 19-year-old man became the first person to receive a prison sentence for the unrest when he was jailed for two months, PA Media reported.\nAnother man was convicted after he admitted assaulting a police officer outside a hotel for asylum seekers in Rotherham, northern England, on Sunday.\nA 15-year-old boy pleaded guilty to committing violent disorder in Liverpool on Saturday after he was identified from a TikTok video. A man in Leeds admitted posting threatening words on Facebook to stir up racial hatred.\nPolice have blamed the disorder on people associated with the now-defunct English Defence League (EDL), a far-right Islamophobic organisation founded 15 years ago, whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.\nCriticism against Starmer\nIn a comment for The Telegraph, former Labour MP Tom Harris wrote that Starmer is failing his first major test. \u201c\nPolitical commentator and Guardian columnist Owen Jones posted, \u201cNobody is saying Keir Starmer is single handedly responsible for far right violence.

And it has been an issue that has long been on the feminist agenda.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that choosing motherhood has been proven to lead to missed promotions, slower career progression, or a gap in work experience,\u201d gender activist Fiona Samuels said. \u201cSocietal expectations about what a mother should prioritise, as well as workplace policies, and the lack of support for working mothers, contribute to these challenges.\u201d\nSamuels, who has a master\u2019s in gender studies, and is reading for her doctorate, said women often face a range of challenges related to pregnancy and motherhood in the workplace, and with continuing their careers.\n\u201cPregnancy and the associated leave can interrupt a woman\u2019s career progression. An unsupportive partner insistent on traditional gender roles can exacerbate this. Any break time often results in missed opportunities for promotions or professional development,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMany women also experience a wage penalty after having children,\u201d she added. \u201cThis gap can result from taking time off work, reduced hours, or being perceived as less committed to their jobs compared to colleagues without children.\n\u201dAlso, pregnant women and mothers may face discrimination, such as being passed over for promotions, receiving fewer high-profile projects, or being stereotyped as less capable or less committed to their careers.\u201c\nFor three mothers interviewed, though they\u2019re working across different industries, their experiences were eerily similar once motherhood interrupted their careers.\n\u201cI was actually given a \u2018promotion\u2019 of sorts after my second baby; it wasn\u2019t paid, but they valued a certain talent I had, and asked me to do some hours in another department,\u201d Destiny, a 26-year-old financial advisor said.\n\u201cThen it became predatory \u2014 work should end at 5:00, and the on-site child care ended at 5:00, so at times I had to take my children into my enclosed office.

There is nothing that can justify or rationalise the far-right violence and racism that we have seen in various parts of the country. There is a danger that people can use an economic justification for these riots and that would be incorrect.\n\u201cIt would be remiss for us not to acknowledge that there is a certain level of deprivation in some of the areas where violence has taken place.\n\u201cDeprivation, high levels of inequality and significant budget cuts from austerity can be used as descriptors for some of these places. However, the economic status of an area is not a justification for violence which was whipped up online and does not represent the communities it has impacted.\u201d\nA number of other areas that saw violence have pockets of deprivation.

In Southport, 24 neighbourhoods fall into the most deprived five per cent nationally and five are in the most deprived one per cent.\nFigures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) showed Middlesborough has a child poverty rate of 41 per cent - the highest of any area in the North East.\nAndy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesbrough since 2012, told PoliticsHome a legacy of \u201crampant inequality\u201d had left the way open to the \u201cterrible behaviours and abuse\u201d of recent days.\nHe said: \u201cOver these years of rampant inequality, our public services have been so appallingly resourced that it leaves the way open to terrible behaviours and abuse.\n\u201cAnd this was such an opportunity, an excuse for those who know about just how weakened we\u2019ve been over these years to really indulge themselves.\u201d", "33290": "title: Far-right violence caused by UK failure to address institutional racism, campaigners warn \n content: Far-right violence caused by UK failure to address institutional racism, campaigners warn\n\u2018People of colour have faced a rowback on their civil and political rights over the past five years,\u2019 UK\u2019s leading racial justice thinktank says\nSupport truly\nindependent journalism\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\nLouise Thomas\nEditor\nThe UK\u2019s failure to address institutional racism is to blame for the recent eruption of far-right violence on the streets, leading campaign groups have said.\nA damning new report by prominent global human rights organisation Amnesty International and the UK\u2019s leading racial justice think tank Runnymede Trust exposed a slew of troubling racial disparities.\nRioters have attacked mosques, ambushed riot police, set fire to a hotel housing migrants and torched a public library and Citizens Advice Bureau building in the aftermath of the fatal stabbing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport at the end of July.\nThere have been multiple incidents of ethnic minorities being attacked on the streets. In the aftermath of the Stockport stabbing, false information spread rapidly online claiming the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker who came to the UK on a small boat crossing.\nA joint submission from the Runnymede Trust and Amnesty International UK to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination discovered that government legislation and policy infringes on key articles of the International Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination \u2013 a UN treaty.\nCampaigners accused successive governments of failing to make sufficient progress on tackling racism as they warned of a ten-year surge in faith-based hate crimes and four-year gridlock on the disparities people of colour grapple with in the criminal justice system, education, health, employment, and immigration.\nThe study, which has gained the backing of over 40 civil society organisations, found 47 per cent of children of colour are living in poverty, in comparison to 24 per cent of white children.\nWhile police are 6.5 times more likely to subject Black children to strip searches, and 4.7 times more likely to strip search Black adults, than their white counterparts.\nResearchers also found Black people are 16 times more likely to be prosecuted, and Asian people 4 times more likely to be prosecuted than their white counterparts under controversial Joint Enterprise laws that effectively enable numerous people to be convicted for one offence.\nThe study drew attention to the fact British Bangladeshi women are over eight times more likely to be out of work than White British women, while women of colour are three times as likely as white men to be in work that relies on zero-hour contracts.\nAlba Kapoor, of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cAs far-right thugs attack, harass and intimidate people of colour in the UK, there could be no more urgent time to address racial injustice.\n\u201cPeople of colour have faced a rowback on their civil and political rights over the past five years. From the inhumane changes to our asylum system, to the introduction of legislation that restricts protest rights and ramps up harmful policing powers, it is time to shift the dial.\u201d\nShe said these issues had occurred in tandem with \u201cdeep-rooted inequalities\u201d in relation to housing, education and wealth amid the cost of living crisis.\n\u201cIt is scandalous that in 2024 people of colour, children included, are facing these levels of poverty and deprivation. These are structural issues, and will need radical solutions to undo them,\u201d Ms Kapoor added.\nResearchers found religious hate crimes against Muslims or those seen to be Muslims make up the greatest proportion of hate crimes. This stands at 44 per cent and is followed by 19 per cent for Jewish people or those assumed to be Jewish.\nAmong other recommendations, campaigners are calling for the government to get rid of the two-child limit benefit cap, stop the usage of strip searches on children and prohibit the use of rap lyrics and music as evidence in prosecutions.\nIlyas Nagdee, Racial Justice Director at Amnesty, said: \u201cThe racist and Islamophobic violence unfolding on the streets of the UK highlight the failures of successive governments to make progress on institutional racism.\n\u201cSince the last reporting period, the Committee should be alert to the myriad ways racism and discrimination have been embedded in legislation and policy practice, rather than tackled by successive governments.\u201d\nResearchers found people of colour who rent their homes are 87 per cent more likely to have endured illegal acts at the hands of their landlord than White British or Irish renters, as well as being 22 per cent more likely to be exposed to damp or mould in their homes.\nA spokesperson for the Home Office and for the Conservative Party has been contacted for comment.", "34012": "title: UK Riots: Fear, uncertainty, caution characterise lives of Nigerians in UK \n content: Blessing Oyindamola, a Nigerian working as a customer service advisor, lives in Manchester, one of the first cities to be attacked by rioters.

Internet chat groups shared a list of agencies and law firms specializing in immigration as possible targets.\nBut in parts of London, Bristol, Oxford and Birmingham, peaceful crowds of anti-racism protesters gathered in such large numbers that they either vastly outnumbered anti-immigrant agitators \u2014 or there was no protest to counter.\nThe head of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service said officers were focused on protecting immigration lawyers and services. In addition to thousands of officers already deployed, about 1,300 specialist forces were on standby in case of serious trouble in London.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll protect those people,\u2033 Commissioner Mark Rowley said. \u201cIt is completely unacceptable, regardless of your political views, to intimidate any sector of lawful activity, and we will not let the immigration asylum system be intimidated.\u201d\nCities and towns have been wracked by riots and looting for the past week as angry mobs, encouraged by far-right extremists, clashed with police and counter-demonstrators. The disturbances began after misinformation spread about the stabbing rampage that killed three girls in the seaside community of Southport, with social media users falsely identifying the suspect as an immigrant and a Muslim.\nRioters spouting anti-immigrant slogans have attacked mosques and hotels housing asylum-seekers, creating fear in Muslim and immigrant communities. In recent days, reports have emerged of violent counterattacks in some areas.\nBy early evening Wednesday, though, trouble had not erupted.\nA couple hundred supporters of immigrants who showed up outside a law office on a residential street in the London neighborhood of North Finchley found themselves largely alone with several dozen police officers.\nThe crowd chanted \u201crefugees welcome\u201d and \u201cLondon against racism.\u201d Some held signs saying \u201cStop the far right,\u201d \u201cMigration is not a crime\u201d and \u201cFinchley against Fascism.\u201d\nOutside an immigration center in the Walthamstow area in east London, a counter-protest leader barked \u201cfascists gone\u201d to which a crowd of hundreds responded: \u201coff our streets.\u201d\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has described the previous disturbances as \u201cfar-right thuggery,\u201d rejecting any suggestion that the riots are about the government\u2019s immigration policies. He has warned that anyone taking part in the violence would \u201cface the full force of the law.\u201d\nPolice have made more than 400 arrests and are considering using counter-terrorism laws to prosecute some rioters. The government has pledged to prosecute those responsible for the disorder, including those who use social media to incite the violence.\nAmong the first to be sentenced was Derek Drummond, 58, who received three years in prison after admitting to violent disorder and punching a police officer in the face in Southport on July 30. He was one of three men jailed after their cases were heard Wednesday at Liverpool Crown Court.\n\u201cThe three men sentenced today are the tip of the iceberg, and just the start of what will be a very painful process for many who foolishly chose to involve themselves in violent unrest,\u2033 said Jonathan Egan, the senior district crown prosecutor. \u201cMany of those involved will be sent to prison for a long time.\u201d\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a post on X that the police, city hall and community leaders were working to protect targeted buildings and places of worship.\n\u201cI know the shocking scenes have left many Muslims and minority ethnic communities scared and fearful, so I ask my fellow Londoners to check on their friends and neighbors and show them that care and compassion is what Londoners are all about,\u201d he said.\nIn Walthamstow, in east London, real estate agents shut down storefronts early and told staff to work from home. The Nags Head pub informed customers via social media it wouldn't open because of \u201cpotential protest.\" The council closed the local library.\nSmaller communities were affected as well. Businesses owners in Westcliff-on-Sea, in southern England, boarded up shopfronts.\nSaira Hussain, who runs a small architectural practice, described the unrest as \"upsetting.''\n\u201cI\u2019m a third-generation British Pakistani,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI was born here, studied here, trade here and employ people from this country.

The hotel is not a stranger to protests. It is contentious locally and had become the scene of anti-immigration outrage in the past \u2013 though there were few who anticipated what a terrifying turn Sunday would take.\nBut the signs that it would be a flashpoint for violence had been there all along. It is an area with deep, decades-long community tensions and a history of clashes over immigration. Over a weekend of escalating violence it flared again.\nAmong the substantial group of local residents who had come to tidy up on Monday morning, the mood was sombre. There was a huge sense of exasperation with their own community and those who stoked violence from farther afield.\nLocals recalled only half an hour of peace before the first missile was thrown. Within two hours more than a dozen hotel windows were broken, rioters had entered the hotel and, in what police described as a \u201cparticularly sickening moment\u201d, attempted to set the building on fire. It was, police said, \u201ca concerted effort to cause \u2026 serious harm to those inside\u201d.\nOne local resident, Susanne, said she had come for a peaceful protest on Sunday but was shocked at what began to unfold. \u201cIt was disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I saw them attack the police, I was nearly crying.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe adrenaline was pumped and they didn\u2019t care what trouble they get into, they were gonna keep going.\u201d\nSome felt the asylum seekers \u2013 who were teenagers in some cases \u2013 had antagonised the baying rioters outside by appearing in the windows and making what they said were offensive gestures. They claimed they had seen the asylum seekers with weapons, though the Guardian understands these were most likely poles from the wardrobes and crutches that one man used to walk.\nAnti-fascist protesters from the local Stand Up To Racism group and the Trades Union Congress were overwhelmed early on and kettled by the violent far-right mob. One Muslim man, Muj, who had been called over from Bradford to help his frightened friend who was stuck at the scene, said he was called a racial slur. Police took them a mile away to safety.\nDozens of officers were brought in from Sheffield, where an anticipated riot never unfolded, and assistance was provided by other local forces to tackle a crowd that had grown to 750 people, police later said.\nThey used riot shields to push violent and aggressive men back. Chants of \u201cTommy Robinson\u201d and, to the disdain of other local people, \u201cYorkshire\u201d could be heard from people who said they \u201cwant our country back\u201d. Police succeeded in gaining significant ground throughout the evening, despite a constant barrage of bottles, bricks and pieces of wood, some of which were set on fire from a large bonfire that filled the sky with smoke.\nA bus stop was smashed and occasionally members of the crowd were pulled through the police line to get treatment from the ambulance as they were hit by errant missiles.\nPolice horses backed up, startled, as fireworks careened in their direction. The officers were not as easily spooked in their fireproof riot gear, standing stoic with their shields as explosives popped at their feet, showering them with sparks. The perpetrators later on were exclusively young, with a local 16-year-old girl saying she knew most of them from school, though some had been in and out of prison.\nThe Guardian spoke to some of the hotel residents through a smashed second-storey window before being moved on by police. Most said they were OK and gave thumbs up but one man shouted down: \u201cI am not OK.\u201d\nIn quiet corners, exhausted police were looked after by colleagues. Some lay on grass verges catching their breath; others simply sat with their heads in their hands. At about 5pm, relieved officers received word their colleague who had been knocked unconscious was being treated in hospital. At least 12 officers were injured in total, according to South Yorkshire police.\nWatching the events, which eventually finished at 5am, unfold with South Yorkshire police silver command was the mayor of South Yorkshire, Oliver Coppard.\n\u201cIt genuinely made me angry and sad,\u201d he said afterwards.\nThe asylum seekers in the hotel were eventually taken to safety in the early hours, he confirmed. \u201cPhysically they were OK, they were safe. Psychologically, though, these are people who come from some of the most violent, poorest parts of the world, and they have come here looking for safety. And then they\u2019ve been attacked, in our community, and faced the same sort of violence as they\u2019ve faced at home here in South Yorkshire. And I\u2019m appalled by that.\u201d\nAppearing at the scene on Monday, the South Yorkshire police assistant chief constable Lindsey Butterfield said it had been \u201ca dark day and we know this was felt across the county\u201d.\nOutside, handing out bottles of water to the helpers, media and police, were two local women who worked in the hotel, one of whom had been behind a barricaded door and powerless in the face of the unfolding violence. She looked fragile, lips trembling as she quietly explained she was not allowed to talk to the media about what had happened.\nWas it terrifying? Tears ran down her face.\n\u201cThat\u2019s your story,\u201d her colleague said sadly.", "35413": "title: Farage joins calls for Parliament to be recalled and claims \u2018soft policing\u2019 at BLM protests to blame for riots \n content: Farage joins calls for Parliament to be recalled and claims \u2018soft policing\u2019 at BLM protests to blame for riots\nThe House of Commons is currently not sitting as a result of summer recess, with MPs not due to return until September 2\nSupport truly\nindependent journalism\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\nLouise Thomas\nEditor\nNigel Farage has joined calls for Parliament to be recalled over riots sweeping the UK, while suggesting the escalation in violence has come as a result of \u201csoft policing\u201d during Black Lives Matter protests.\nThe Reform UK leader condemned the violence taking place on Britain\u2019s streets, saying \u201cthe levels of intimidation and threat to life have no place in a functioning democracy\u201d.\nBut he went on to claim there is a widespread impression of \u201ctwo-tier policing\u201d, which he said is contributing to a \u201csense of injustice\u201d.\nIn a statement on Monday, Mr Farage said: \u201cI have been totally appalled by the levels of violence seen in the last couple of days. The levels of intimidation and threat to life have no place in a functioning democracy.\n\u201cThat so many police officers have been injured trying to keep the peace is shocking, and we should not discount the use of the army if the situation were to deteriorate further.\u201d\nThe MP for Clacton also expressed concern over prime minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s response to the riots.\nHe added: \u201cIn the short term, we will quell the riots, but deeper longer-term problems remain. Ever since the soft-policing of the Black Lives Matter protests, the impression of two-tier policing has become widespread. The Prime Minister\u2019s faltering attempts to address the current crisis have only added to that sense of injustice.\n\u201cThe majority of our population can see the fracturing of our communities as a result of mass, uncontrolled immigration, whether legal or illegal.\n\u201cYet to attempt to debate this in the public arena leads to immediate howls of condemnation. A population explosion without integration was always going to end badly. I have said this for many years.\n\u201cWe must have a more honest debate about these vital issues and give people the confidence that there are political solutions that are relevant to them. A recall of Parliament would be an appropriate start to this.\u201d\nFormer home secretary Dame Priti Patel pushed back against Mr Farage\u2019s remarks, saying they are \u201csimply not relevant\u201d nor correct.\nAsked about the Reform UK leader\u2019s statement, the former home secretary told Times Radio there is a \u201cstark difference\u201d between the \u201cthuggery, violence and racism\u201d seen over the last week and the \u201cprotests that were being policed\u201d during the pandemic.\nShe added that \u201ca lot of what we have seen is down to misinformation and social media\u201d, warning it is \u201cirresponsible\u201d to think everything on social media is factual.\nViolence has broken out in several parts of England and Northern Ireland following the killing of three young girls in Southport last week.\nMore than 145 people have been arrested so far after riots rocked major cities including Manchester, Liverpool, Hull and Stoke.\nA large crowd gathered outside a mosque in Middlesbrough on Sunday night and others have also been targeted. In Rotherham, anti-immigration rioters smashed the windows of the Holiday Inn Express before starting fires.\nDowning Street will hold an emergency Cobra meeting will be held today, as the violence and public unrest enters its sixth day.\nMr Farage has faced criticism for his remarks surrounding the unrest, with Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside Kim Johnson calling his comments \u201cdangerous\u201d and calling for them to be examined by the parliamentary standards commissioner.\nHe has released two videos since the Southport attack last week. The first saw him question whether police were withholding information about the suspect, while the second saw him question Sir Keir\u2019s argument that the protests were the fault of the far-right.\nOn Wednesday, deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said politicians have \u201ca level of responsibility \u2026 and it\u2019s not to stoke up what conspiracy theories or what you think might have happened\u201d.\nThe House of Commons is currently not sitting due to the summer recess, with MPs not scheduled to return until September 2. The government can ask the Speaker to recall the House because of events of major national importance.\nParliament was last recalled in the summer of 2021 during the chaotic UK evacuation from Afghanistan. Ex-Tory MP David Cameron also ordered MPs to return in 2011 in response riots and looting.\nMr Farage joins a growing list of MPs calling for the recall of Parliament, which includes Labour MP Diane Abbott, who urged for MPs to sit due to: \u201cnationwide anti-immigrant riots on a scale never seen before. Threatening life, property and our police force.\u201d\nDame Priti and left-wing MP Zarah Sultana also called for Parliament to be recalled.\nBut on Monday, Yvette Cooper said the government is not currently planning to do so.\nAsked whether MPs will be recalled, the home secretary told LBC radio: \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing right now. What we\u2019re doing right now is keeping in close contact with MPs.\u201d\nShadow home secretary and Tory leadership candidate James Cleverly also disagreed with calls to recall Parliament, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything that parliament needs to sign off. If the flow of information is fast enough that will give the reassurance that Parliament wants.\u201d", "35481": "title: A week of riots across the UK filled me with fear, but Wednesday\u2019s show of solidarity has given me hope \n content: When three little girls, Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar, were so callously killed in Southport last week, I \u2013 along with the entire country \u2013 was sickened and shaken to the core. But there was no time for their families to grieve in peace, or space for the solidarity that arises from a period of national sorrow. Instead, the tragedy was violently hijacked by far-right thugs on the basis of flagrant lies, emerging from a climate of Islamophobia and racist, divisive rhetoric that has always been a threat to us all.\nOver the past week, my mobile phone has been pinging with messages conveying anxiety and fear from family, friends and colleagues. Clips have been circulating of Muslim businesses torched, ethnic minority members of the public being attacked and chants of \u201cPakis out\u201d at passersby on the streets.\nAn American Pakistani friend asked whether her family should cancel their flight to London. A friend\u2019s law firm, which represents asylum seekers, was on a list of supposed \u201ctargets\u201d. My brother, a GP, decided not to do a home visit in a deprived white area for fear of attack by far-right sympathisers. While others are defiant and refusing disruption to their daily routines, I am bitter and resentful about how many people\u2019s lives now have to be approached with caution, and how safety is now a consideration for everyday, often trivial decisions. All of this because of extremist fearmongering.\nI have been watching the news incessantly. I can\u2019t switch off because it is all so painfully, exhaustingly personal. When Zarah Sultana, an MP and an Asian Muslim woman like me, was derided, interrupted and gaslit while pointing out the reality of Islamophobia to an all-white panel of hosts on Good Morning Britain this week, it was like our experiences were being undermined. Even the dead couldn\u2019t lie in peace: Muslim graves in Burnley were daubed with paint, and I felt it could have been my own father\u2019s grave that was desecrated. When a black care worker\u2019s car was torched, it was all frighteningly close to home.\nIt\u2019s not as if I, or others like me, haven\u2019t faced instances of racism before. I was first called a \u201cPaki\u201d at the age of five, as a teen told to \u201cgo back to your own country\u201d, and as an adult was taunted while riding a London bus by an intoxicated passenger: \u201cYou Muslims, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d But I could brush these off as isolated, even innocuous, incidents in a largely peaceful life. Through the years, I have learned to scoff at the occasional passive-aggressive look from strangers to remind me of my \u201cotherness\u201d. But nothing has shaken me as much as the levels of violence seen during these terrifying riots; scenes that for many people older than me will trigger unsettling memories of the racist attacks of the 1970s and 80s.\nI am not alone by any means. It\u2019s not only minorities that feel this way: everyone is scared to some degree, everyone feels attacked because, and I cannot stress this enough, far-right extremism is a threat to us all. A threat to our way of life, our peace and safety, and to the thriving diversity that I still believe Britain is the beacon of \u2013 despite the divisive forces that seek to destroy it.\nThe fascists have done one constructive thing: an abundance of goodwill and solidarity has come to the fore as different communities have united to defy their racism and thuggery. In Southport, the mess they left brought people on to the streets to clean up after the attack on a mosque; in Liverpool, an imam launched a crowdfunder to help repair the local library and buildings damaged by riots; and people are now willing to unite to fight against racism even more tenaciously.\nI was moved to tears by the beautiful solidarity on display across the country as thousands of people voiced their unity against hate in large anti-racism demonstrations on Wednesday evening. Gathering to protect their local communities and places rumoured to be targeted by the far right \u2013 who were barely to be seen \u2013 they held aloft placards that read \u201cNans Against Nazis\u201d, \u201cRefugees welcome\u201d and \u201cThis is what community looks like\u201d. The people of Britain sent a clear and strong message \u2013 there is no place for fascism in our country.\nSuch demonstrations are a testament to a resilient community spirit. Yet until we see a marked change in public and political discourse that challenges the insidious rhetoric of division and racism in all its forms, until we see accountability for those inciting hate and spreading lies, and until we address institutional racism, the danger of far-right extremism will not be suppressed. It will continue to drip-feed from the top down and manifest in ugliness on our streets and in our society, negatively affecting all British lives.\nWe each have a role to play: politicians, the media, leaders, philanthropists and all members of local communities have the agency to define the political climate through the power of togetherness, through truth-telling, through investment and the celebration of diversity in every field.\nHow long the scars of this violence will last, and how more organised or underground these extreme groups will become, remains to be seen. But challenging the discourse, and protecting and building a society where everyone feels they belong, is a continual process that we can all lend our hands to.\n-\nRemona Aly is a journalist and broadcaster with a focus on faith and lifestyle\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The bad, mad and testosterone-crazed stormtroopers of Britain\u2019s racist right were driven off the streets of towns and cities by the better people who would have none of it. Decency, humanity and the forces of civilisation prevailed by sheer force of numbers.\nA month in, Labour faced its first crisis blowing in from a clear blue sky. Who\u2019s in control? That\u2019s the primary test of any government. \u201cI will keep you safe,\u201d Keir Starmer promised early in the day, and indeed the \u201cfull force of the law\u201d and a \u201cstanding army\u201d of 6,000 police did just that, aided by the crowds of citizens praised today by police chiefs. Met police commissioner Mark Rowley cited \u201cthe show of unity from communities\u201d that \u201ctogether defeated the challenges we have seen\u2019\u2019. Let that message go far and wide.\nSlapping instant sentences on the violent, their faces and names plastered on screens while warning that hundreds more would follow them into jail, helped to do what the state must do, beyond all other duties: safeguard its people. How very close we came to the unspeakable horror of hotels full of terrified migrants incinerated by mobs of haters. If things are calmer today, let\u2019s not forget what has passed.\nRiot hovers ever-present just beneath the veneer of civilisation, a layer of male violence ready to erupt in exuberant hate. This time, and not for the first time, it was encouraged by shameless leaders nowhere near the streets themselves.\nBuilding through the Brexit years, increasing in toxicity, the right and their press allies have singled out group after group as \u201cthe enemies of the people\u201d. From those who have agitated on social media to a home secretary now gone who talked of a migrant \u201cinvasion\u201d, they have given the hooligans cause to target \u201cothers\u201d. It\u2019s par for that course. Go as far back as you like and it\u2019s usually the \u201celite\u201d and their press barons who ignite the fight. The vicious Gordon riots against the Catholics were led by Lord Gordon. Now it\u2019s the likes of Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick\u2019s call just yesterday to criminalise the words \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and Rishi Sunak\u2019s poisonous \u201cstop the boats\u201d campaign that have stoked the flames. They seek the respectability of mainstream politics, but they disgrace it. They, like Tommy Robinson and Laurence Fox, stand accused as inciters and exploiters of that strand of ever-ready violence.\nWe know what happened last night. We know who took a stand. Yesterday\u2019s mendacious Express headline \u201cUK riots spark far-left protests\u201d symbolises the attempt of the right to deny the uprising of ordinary decency against the right and the likes of the despicable Express. But we saw with our own eyes the sheer numbers, thousands upon thousands, who went out to defend mosques with homemade cardboard signs of wit and sincerity: hail to the \u201cnans against Nazis\u201d in Liverpool. We know. Note how much of the press refers mainly to the decent defenders of law offices, mosques and churches giving food to penniless asylum seekers as \u201ccounter-protesters\u201d, not anti-racists. We are not fooled. Anti-racism was the catalyst for the pushback. Anti-racists were at the forefront.\nWhat we learned last night and what we told the world was that the rightwing media, the GB News presenters and the Telegraph hysterics, for all their foghorn power, do not represent a country that just elected a social democratic government with a huge majority. The great uniting election message was a determination to oust a Tory government that shamelessly tried to use immigration as an \u201canti-woke\u201d distraction from the economic and social destruction caused by their austerity policies.\nAs parts of the country were effectively shut down last night, with shuttered shops and boarded-up offices, the police and the new government moved to reintroduce decency to our streets.\nStarmer faced a primal hazard for any government, but he and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, emerged as competent and equal to the challenge. That bodes well.\nStill, riots do have effects. Watch now as everyone tries to interpret what has happened to their own political advantage. Nigel Farage claims \u201cthe public have woken up\u201d as a YouGov poll shoots immigration to the top of the list of public concerns, which it never was in the election. The editor of the Sunday Telegraph, Allister Heath, in full froth, under the headline, \u201cThese sickening riots have exposed our social model as a fraudulent sham\u201d, says: \u201cOur zero-sum game welfare state is crippled by massive dependency and a misplaced sense of entitlement. We need a rethink on immigration \u2026\u201d\nImmigration was always going to be as much of a problem for Labour as for the Tories. At least it can begin to address it without making impossible Canute-like pledges such as Sunak\u2019s \u201cstop the boats\u201d.\nWhen the fighting stops, the battle for the narrative begins, and if we have reached that stage, hold the thought today that it was not just forces of law and order that won the day, but also the multitudes of people, ordinary decent people, who came out on the streets to defend the streets, defend their values, protect vulnerable people and to prevent more outrages.

Eight officers were injured including two who required hospital treatment, the prosecutor said.\nBitten by dog\nMs Masters said Mailen ignored repeated demands to leave and was struck in the leg by an officer with an extendable baton.\nThat prompted his partner, 29-year-old Ryan Sheers, to approach police, with footage showing him shouting at officers not to touch him and that he \"paid [their] wages\".\nA police dog then bit Sheers, of Powlett Road, on the buttocks and both he and Mailen were arrested.\nMs Masters said it took at least five officers to restrain Mailen, who the court heard used to be a school governor and postmaster and had never been in trouble with the law before.\nHe later told officers he and Sheers had been at bingo during the afternoon and came across the gathering when they went out to buy more drink.\nBoth men told police they had been \"cheeky\" to officers and were sorry.\nIn mitigation for the pair, Nigel Soppitt said neither man knew the protest was planned and had encountered it by chance.\nMr Soppitt said the pair \"despised\" far right ideology and, as gay men in Hartlepool, had suffered and called out prejudice all their lives.\nHe said both were drunk having spent a day at the bingo and Mailen realised now he should have left as ordered, while Sheers played a lesser role and only confronted police after he saw his partner being struck with a baton, causing a \"red mist\" to descend.\nThey were each jailed for two years and two months.\nMeanwhile, Kieron Gatenby, 19, and Bobby Shirbon, who turned 18 on the day of the protests, were part of a group \"shouting racial slurs and the word 'Tommy'\" while throwing missiles including wooden planks and glass bottles at police at about 22:30, Ms Masters said.\nShe said both Gatenby, of Yeovil Walk, and Shirbon, of Cornwall Street, were seen smashing house windows.\nIn his police interview, Gatenby said he threw an egg after coming across the protest while going to visit his girlfriend, but \"denied having any racist beliefs\".\nIn mitigation, Calum McNicholas said Gatenby \"saw something kicking off and decided to get involved\" and he was now \"disgusted\" at himself.\nGatenby was detained for 16 months at a YOI.\nShirbon, who was arrested the following day after throwing a beer bottle at a police vehicle, told officers it was \"ok\" as \"everyone else [was] doing it\".\nHis barrister, Michael Cahill, said Shirbon had been out celebrating his birthday and \"foolishly went to see what was going on\".\nShirbon was detained for 20 months at a YOI.\nA fifth defendant, 30-year-old Carl Holliday of Tankerville Street, threw several large metal sheets at police while aggressively shouting and swearing at officers over a 30-minute period, Ms Masters said.\nIn mitigation, Duncan McReddie said Holliday had been a \"chronic alcoholic\" since the age of 15 and on 31 July he had drunk about 30 cans of lager when he \"heard a commotion\" several streets away.\nMr McReddie said Holliday was a \"drunken fool\" who \"joined in\" with the mob, but he held no \"racist\" or \"extreme political views\" at all.\nHolliday was jailed for two years and eight months.\nJudge Francis Laird KC said the men's behaviour had been \"truly disgraceful\" and they were part of a \"violent mob\" which wrought \"devastation and chaos\".\nHe also said he accepted the men had \"no racist or ideological motives\" for their violence, but the public were \"rightly outraged\" by their \"behaviour on the streets of our country\".\nIn a statement read to the court, Cleveland Police Chief Constable Mark Webster said the violent protests which hit Hartlepool and Middlesbrough had an \"immense impact\" on the public and the force.\nHe said: \"People genuinely fear for their own safety in communities they have lived in their whole lives.\"\nMr Webster said officers facing aggression was part of the job, but the \"level of hatred and violence\" during the protests had been unprecedented and there had been \"determined efforts to seriously injure officers\".\nDetectives were now investigating 150 crimes linked to the protests, said the chief constable who estimated the cost of damage to police equipment, including 14 vehicles, at more than \u00a3300,000.\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Six thousand trained police officers were on standby to respond. In the end, it did not materialise on anything like the scale feared: relatively few agitators were dwarfed by huge crowds of anti-racist demonstrators sending a message that the far-right were not welcome in their communities.\nThat was a huge relief, but, as the prime minister warned on Friday, there is no room for complacency. With hindsight, the social media posts that claimed there would be action in many locations looked more like an attempt to instigate it than a sign of networked organisation. The prompt arrest of so many rioters in preceding days, with some already sentenced to long spells in prison, undoubtedly had a deterrent effect. But on Thursday and Friday nights, anti-immigration unrest continued in Belfast and the police remain on alert this weekend.\nWhat we have seen so far remains on a much smaller scale than the England riots of 2011. But effort must now be devoted to understanding what drove this far-right hijacking of the killing of three young girls, propelled by misinformation about the identity of their attacker. Just 7% of the British public say they support the 2024 riots, but the targeting of mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers has revealed the extent of latent prejudice, including virulent Islamophobia, among a small minority of the population, and heightened fears among minority communities. There is a risk that misinformation about how the state is dealing with unrest \u2013 such as the false claim that white offenders are being dealt with more harshly than those of other ethnicities \u2013 will stoke further tensions.\nMuch of the explanation posited so far has come from those looking at the unrest through the prism of their own worldviews. This is not helpful to understanding why it occurred and how to prevent future disorder. The government needs to commission a proper inquiry into who instigated it, who took part and the underlying causes.\nThe review must look at the role that far-right ideology and organisation played, including the spread of misinformation online. The far right has long exploited the issue of asylum hotels, as highlighted in a 2024 review by the government\u2019s social cohesion adviser, Sara Khan; in 2023, protests outside a Merseyside hotel used to house asylum seekers turned into violent clashes with the police. Extremists of all types have become adept at using disinformation and conspiracy theories to attract and provoke people online. That creates an even more challenging context for the Prevent programme whose objective is to prevent the radicalisation of individuals into far-right, Islamist and other forms of extremism. Social media companies should be doing more to reduce the spread of harmful misinformation; the Online Safety Act is yet to be fully implemented and should help, but it is complex to design levers that work effectively without compromising lawful free expression online.\nIn light of evidence that most of the 2011 riots occurred in areas ranking in the bottom 10% on measures of social cohesion, the government needs to develop a proper social cohesion strategy. Khan highlights that cohesion is a much broader concept than integration. The former is about supporting \u201cdiverse yet established citizens and communities to live well together and be resilient to inevitable tensions that will occur from time to time\u201d; that includes intra-minority and intra-faith tension. The latter is about helping new arrivals to integrate into British life.\nToo much commentary in recent days has loosely attributed the riots to poor levels of integration; in fact, the UK performs relatively well on certain measures of integration, with sustained intergenerational falls in levels of prejudice, gradual decreases in levels of residential segregation, and second-generation immigrant children outperforming non-immigrant children at school. Despite several reports on community cohesion since 2000, the government does not have a framework with which to measure it nor an evidence base on what works. There are examples of incidents flaring up and being dealt with very poorly by local authorities; for example, the appalling treatment of the teacher in Batley, West Yorkshire, forced to go into hiding after he taught a lesson on free speech and blasphemy that included images of the prophet Muhammad.\nFinally, community cohesion is inevitably undermined by economic hardship. Too many people have poor experiences of a dysfunctional housing market, insufficient economic opportunities and cannot access good public services. This is the product of years of political failure and creates fertile territory for rightwing populists to blame the country\u2019s ills on immigrants: such populism has dominated Conservative politics for the past decade and found recent success in the guise of Reform. There are legitimate debates to be had about the right levels of immigration and how asylum should work; what is illegitimate is pretending that immigration is responsible for the underfunding of the NHS, or a lack of school places, or the high cost of housing, when they are overwhelmingly the product of political choices.\nThe worst of the unrest is hopefully behind us. But what has played out over the past two weeks serves as a reminder that we cannot take a healthy, pluralistic and tolerant society for granted; it is something that political leaders must learn to nurture.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

About 400 people have been arrested.\n\u201cI guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, either directly or those whipping up this disorder online,\u201d Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a televised address on Sunday. He has cast the riots as \u201corganised illegal thuggery\u201d by a minority of Britons.\nIn the grips of a sixth day of violence, Downing Street held a Cabinet Office briefing room (Cobra) emergency meeting.\nHere\u2019s what you should know:\nWhat led to this moment?\nLast week, during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop at a community centre in Southport, England, three young girls were stabbed to death by a 17-year-old suspect, Axel Rudakubana. He was born in Cardiff, the Welsh capital, reportedly to Christian Rwandan parents.\nFalse information on social media claimed the suspect was a Muslim immigrant.\nThose rioting are vocal about their hatred of immigrants. But there is also a sense of underlying xenophobia against minority communities in the UK, especially Muslims, said analysts.\nRosa Freedman, a professor at the University of Reading, told Al Jazeera that the riots were a result of the former Conservative government\u2019s complicity with such \u201cracist\u201d far-right groups.\n\u201cInstead of hiding their faces, they have now been coming out \u2026 we cannot blame a Labour Party that has [only] been in government [for] the past four weeks,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, agitators like Tommy Robinson are stoking tensions.\nBorn Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, the far-right activist and co-founder of the English Defence League (EDL), has been busy posting inflammatory video rants to his 800,000 followers on X, decrying Muslims, migrants, the political establishment and police.\nHe\u2019s posting from afar, reportedly in Cyprus. A High Court judge issued an arrest warrant for Robinson after he failed to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice on Monday for a hearing in a contempt of libel court case he lost against Syrian refugee Jamal Hijazi.\nInfluencer Andrew Tate, who has suggested the Southport suspect arrived in the UK on a boat, and MP Nigel Farage, more on him later, are also accused of stirring division.\nWhere are the riots?\nIn multiple cities and towns across the country.\nIn addition to Southport, Rotherham and Tamworth, clashes have also been reported in Manchester, Liverpool, Belfast in Northern Ireland, and other cities.\nPosts are swirling on social media describing other planned far-right events. Al Jazeera could not independently verify these claims.\nWhat has the government said?\nPrime Minister Starmer said he \u201cutterly\u201d condemns \u201cfar-right thuggery\u201d.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper stated in a recent interview with Sky News: \u201cThere will be people who were thinking they were going on their summer holidays this week, and instead they will face a knock on the door from the police.\u201d\nNigel Farage, the anti-immigration leader of the populist movement Reform UK who is now a sitting MP, has stoked tensions. In May, he suggested Muslims do not share British values.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve seen on the streets of Hartlepool, London or Southport is nothing compared to what could happen over the course of the next few weeks,\u201d Farage said recently.\nHe\u2019s also justified the riots.\n\u201cThe far right are a reaction to fear, to discomfort, to unease that is out there shared by tens of millions of people,\u201d he said.\nNeil Basu, the UK\u2019s former head of counter-terrorism policing, has accused Farage of not going far enough to condemn the violence.\n\u201cHas Nigel Farage condemned the violence? Has he condemned the EDL? Fomenting discord in society is what these people seem to exist for,\u201d Basu stated.\nPolicing minister Dame Diana Johnson promised consequences and action against those responsible for the disorder and violence in the streets.\n\u201cWhen I saw people looting some of the shops in the city centre, that\u2019s nothing to do with genuine protest or people having different opinions about immigration,\u201d Johnson said.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nPolice and officials are telling the public that perpetrators of violence and abuse will be punished. Meanwhile, ethnic minority and migrant communities are becoming more fearful.\nIn a recent news conference, South Yorkshire Police\u2019s Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield stated, \u201cIf you were there, we will find you and you will be held accountable for yesterday\u2019s violence.\u201d\nVeteran Labour MP Diane Abbott said on X, \u201cNationwide anti-immigrant riots on a scale never seen before.

The disinformation, since neither is true, fuelled the worst bout of violence to hit the nation in years.\nThe riots, which took place in dozens of areas, have been extinguished thanks to the thousands of antiracism protesters who outnumbered them in a show of solidarity with those affected. Police have handed heavy sentences to rioters, which has also dissuaded others from joining in.\nBut several Liverpudlians, and many other Britons, are now questioning years of integration.\nObservers have blamed politicians and some sections of the media for railing against immigration while demonising Muslims and asylum seekers.\n\u201cAfter the \u2018War on Terror\u2019, the political conversation and legislation around counterterrorism was about targeting Muslim communities as a threat to national security,\u201d said Shabna Begum, head of Runnymede Trust, a race equality and civil rights think tank.\n\u201cAnd now they have been identified as a cultural threat to British democracy based on ages-old tropes on the Muslim civilisation being barbaric.\u201d\nOver the years, mainstream politics and some media soaked up that narrative which paved the way for the \u201cnormalisation of an Islamophobic rhetoric\u201d in the UK and therefore the dehumanisation of Muslims, she explained.\nAs political attention shifted towards a rise in undocumented migrants crossing the Channel, many say brown and Black asylum seekers have been thrown into the same category.\nMuslims, refugees and non-white people were attacked at random in the riots.\nAccording to Chris Allen, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Leicester, both Labour and the Conservatives have contributed to the vilification of Muslims, clearing the way for the general populace to slur minority groups.\n\u201cThis is partly the legacy of the Brexit Leave campaign\u2019s toxic rhetoric on popular views about immigration that continued right up to the recent general election,\u201d Allen said, adding that politicians have failed to call out Islamophobia when they see it.\nThe sneering contempt of \u2018journalists\u2019 will never stop me from calling out racism and Islamophobic hate. pic.twitter.com/cQoNKDzJ78\n\u2014 Zarah Sultana MP (@zarahsultana) August 5, 2024\nOn a recent popular morning television show, Labour politician Zahra Sultana was asked why identifying Islamophobia and the racialised nature of many attacks was important in tackling racism. As she tried to answer, she was interrupted by the panel, which many on social media said exemplified an attempt to silence discussions on racism.\n\u201cWe need to call this racism, and we need to call this Islamophobic, because if we don\u2019t, we fail to address what is going on. Language is really important,\u201d Sultana said on the programme.\nTellMAMA, which monitors anti-Muslim hate crimes, said Islamophobic incidents have more than doubled in the past decade.\nDuring Israel\u2019s continuing war on Gaza, anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased \u2013 according to TellMAMA, such incidents tripled in the first four months of the conflict. Research by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also shows a sharp rise in anti-Muslim content across online platforms during the same period. Similarly, UK groups that monitor anti-Jewish hate crimes have reported a rise during the war.\nAccording to Imam Adam Kelwick, the missing element is dialogue.\nStanding outside Liverpool\u2019s Abdullah Quilliam mosque, he has just returned from an unusual meeting over coffee.\nHe had sat across the table from a far-right protester who was among the dozens who rallied outside the mosque recently.\nAt the time, Kelwick confronted the situation by crossing police lines and offering burgers and chips to the angry crowd. He hugged protesters and promised more dialogue.\n\u201cWhat happens when you come together is that you start talking and listening. You start to find out that many of the concerns that the other side has are also your concerns,\u201d said Adam. \u201cAll it takes is a human interaction.\u201d\nHe plans to open the mosque\u2019s gates on Saturday to engage in more discussions with members of the far right.\nBut as he attempts to talk, others need time to heal.\n\u201cThere was a feeling that we were so embedded in the community \u2013 all the progress of the past years seemed to have dashed in the course of one evening,\u201d said Tawhid Islam, a member and trustee of the Liverpool Region Mosque Network. \u201cA seed of doubt has now been planted and people ask themselves, \u2018Am I part of this community if I am not white?\u2019\u201d", "36973": "title: Who is behind the race hate violence? \n content: Who is behind the Belfast race violence?\nToxic algorithms, far-right alliances across sectarian divides and old-fashioned race hate with an \u201celement\u201d of paramilitarism.\nThese are just some of the issues that converged in a week that saw racist violence hit the streets of Belfast.\nMuslim businesses were burnt down, a man\u2019s head was stamped on, and houses were targeted in racially-motivated attacks.\nBBC News NI has asked the question: Who is behind it all?\nIt is a difficult question to answer because the reality is: No one truly knows.\nBut a good place to start is to ask how did we get here?\nIt was the murder of three children in Southport that led to riots in towns and cities across England.\nThis triggered the anti-immigration protest at Belfast City Hall last Saturday, which descended into a day and night of violence, before further disorder followed.\nBut in reality, race hate has been rising in Northern Ireland over recent months and years.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is an escalation but in reality a continuum of a long-term issue of racist intimidation and racist violence, largely driven by elements of loyalist paramilitarism,\u201d said Daniel Holder, director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice.\n\u201cAnd one of the issues is, because there has been a high level of impunity for that activity, that has potentially emboldened those to go on and do this even more out in the open, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen this week.\u201d\nThe PSNI said it was in no doubt that a paramilitary \u201celement\u201d was involved in the disorder. But loyalist sources insist none of it has been orchestrated at organisational level.\n\u201cI mean, loyalism is not a monolith there are those who do wish to move on,\u201d said Daniel Holder.\n\u201cWe really need armed groups to go away completely but there are certainly elements of loyalist paramilitary groups engaged in racist violence and intimidation.\u201d\nWhether the leadership of those groups have moved to discourage those engaging in violence remains to be seen.\nOne loyalist source likened the recent flare-up of trouble in south Belfast to \u201ca bag of marbles, it's hard to know what will happen next\".\nThere is an argument that those engaged in disorder are frustrated by a lack of social housing, but at the same time, there\u2019s been an element of recreational rioting at play.\nThe claim that young people have been spurred onto the streets by older people with links to paramilitaries is something the police are investigating.\nBut it is also argued that those rioting have been fuelled by disinformation fed online through social media pages and groups managed by anonymous actors.\nOne man was arrested on suspicion of publishing written material intended to stir up hatred.\nPosts on one such page included encouragement to attend planned anti-immigration protests \u2013 but those behind the page insist they are not the organisers of the events.\nOne post stated the protests \"should remain peaceful/respectful at all times\".\nOn the other hand, other posts appear to try to whip up anger and resentment towards ethnic minorities.\nThe page also posted about an unlikely cross-border alliance that emerged at last Saturday\u2019s protest and that saw union flags and tricolours carried side-by-side.\nSocial media impact\nProtesters carrying a \u201cCoolock Says No\u201d banner marched through the streets.\nIt is believed those carrying it were associated with the movement in Dublin which is opposed to asylum seekers moving into a site in the north of the city.\nOne of the men, who travelled from Dublin with the group, posted a video on social media, which appears to have since been deleted, saying \u201chistory [was] being made\u201d with loyalist and nationalists marching together.\nIn another, he said: \u201cWhen you be seeing tricolours and union jacks marching side-by-side with a common goal, walking together as opposed to tearing lumps out of each other?\u201d\nMark Malone, from the civil society organisation Hope for Courage Collective, suggested that, in some cases, this solidarity might be an example of alliances being formed by the far-right.\n\u201cThere have always been attempts by very small numbers of people to try to make alliances across traditional sectarian divides, on the basis of white supremacy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHowever, in the context of the north itself, those alliances have never really lasted or gone anywhere.\u201d\nHe said when talking about relatively small numbers of protesters, the effects online can still be large.\n\u201cPart of the issue is the sort of amplification of even small numbers on social media that can give the appearance of broad swell of support rather than an actual reflection of the particular numbers of the people who are involved in the act of organising itself,\u201d he said.\nWhen it comes to the spreading of misinformation, social media platforms do have incentives in place to try and crack down, but obviously this is a big job.\nWhile liking a page or following a particular account on social media is the user\u2019s choice, there are concerns that extreme content is being \u201cpushed\u201d on people by the companies behind the platforms \u2013 by something called \u201ctoxic algorithms\u201d.\nThese determine what social media users see in their feeds, based on things like their age, gender and search history.\nJohnny Ryan, from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, said he is really worried about the issue.\n\u201cIf, for example, you\u2019re concerned about or maybe if you\u2019re only curious about the opening of a centre near you to house refugees, that is the kind of signal that these completely wild recommender systems may pick up on and start pushing content about young males of fighting age and all of that kind of stuff,\u201d he said.\nHe added that while there have always been niches of people with extreme views, they have tended to remain in that niche.\n\u201cBut this system is finding that type of stuff and it is artificially amplifying what otherwise would not be seen by people, and it\u2019s pushing it and recommending it into your feed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this system push the seeds of angst and hate and loathing and despair at people who it has judged are sensitive to receiving it.\u201d", "37048": "title: Anti-racism Muslim group urge government to ramp up safety commitments for women after riots \n content:

Britain across the past week which have left dozens of people injured and hundreds arrested.\nShaista Aziz, Amna Abdullatif and Huda Jawad, who are known as \u201cThe Three Hijabis\u201d due to their heritage and Islamic religious dress, have been contacted by Muslim women across the country with worries and reports of their hijabs being pulled off in the street.\nYet, there is no specific government strategy in place to safeguard Muslim women, despite the government\u2019s stated \u201cmission\u201d to protect women and girls.\n\u201cMuslim women being afraid to travel into their town and city centres \u2013 making them no-go areas for them, is gendered Islamophobia,\u201d a statement, first seen by The Independent, from The Three Hijabis says.\n\u201cMuslim women have told us that they have changed their daily routine taking care not to be outside of their homes due to fear of being attacked by far-right mobs.\n\u201cMuslim women shared their concerns about the safety and wellbeing of their children, brothers, husbands and family members, particularly when attending mosque. Mosques have been the target of coordinated far-right Islamophobic attacks.\u201d\nThe statement continued: \u201cWe call for gendered Islamophobia to be acknowledged as a specific form of violence against women and girls at the highest levels of government.\u201d\nThe Three Hijabis are also calling on specialist services to advocate for the safety of Muslim women and girls, recognising that it is part of their work to stand up for all women and communities.\nMuslim women have also expressed concerns over rumours circulating of them being targets of far-right violence including acid attacks.\n\u201cWhile acid attack rumours are currently unsubstantiated, having the intended impact of sending fear throughout British Muslim communities, pushing Muslim women and girls back in their homes, the aim of misogyny and gendered Islamophobia,\u201d The Three Hijabis explained.\nSpeaking with The Independent, Ms Aziz, Ms Abdullatif and Ms Jawad have expressed fear for their own safety and that of loved ones due to the race riots.\nMs Jawad, who fled Iraq and came to England as a two-year-old refugee, feels she may well be safer in the warzone that she once left.\n\u201cThis is triggering because the far right is targeting refugees, as well as Muslims. It feels like many different parts of me are attacked all at the same time,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI came to this country because I thought there is rule of law and there were values around respecting humanity and human rights. But it\u2019s very clear that I am probably safer in a despotic regime in the Middle East than here.\u201d\nDuring a press conference last week, prime minister Sir Keir Starmer branded the riots as \u201cfar-right thuggery\u201d but stopped short of describing rioters as racist or Islamophobic.\nInstead, he mentioned \u201cracist rhetoric\u201d and acknowledged the targeting of Muslim communities, however campaigners including The Three Hijabis don\u2019t think Sir Starmer went far enough.\n\u201cI am surprised at the naming of it as racism,\u201d Ms Jawad said.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the lack of kind of preparation by the government and why are we always thinking that the only answer is the police, when the police are actually part of the problem? They are the Islamophobes, they are the misogynists and they are the racists.\u201d\n\u201cI feel extremely devastated but I\u2019m not surprised at all that this is happening,\u201d Ms Aziz said.\n\u201cThis is the inevitable outcome of decades of dehumanising Muslims, refugees, migrants and Black people.\n\u201cThere has been more and more mainstreaming of Islamophobia and the genocide unfolding in Gaza is part of the equation here as well.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI feel very emotional because I\u2019m going around telling women in my family to be careful, and men in my family and my friends. I\u2019m telling them not to go out, to be careful.\n\u201cI\u2019m terrified; I\u2019m not that type of person and I don\u2019t want to be that person, but there is a real change in the air.\u201d\nMs Abdullatif, a mother of two, echoed this and said she\u2019s asked her daughters to avoid leaving the house.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this anxious about going out,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn previous iterations, where we\u2019ve had spikes in Islamophobic abuse, I would just show up because we shouldn\u2019t be scared to come out in our communities and in the cities where we live.\n\u201cBut this feels much more scarier than anything I\u2019ve experienced before in the UK.\u201d\nThrough lobbying the government and pointing to how local communities around Britain are rallying against the far right, in support of one another, The Three Hijabis feel compelled to resist hateful forces and are heartened by people power.\nMs Aziz said: \u201cWe\u2019re moved by how the communities are coming together and how they\u2019re supporting each other; the kindness, the love, the compassion. Not just Muslims towards Muslims; there\u2019s an understanding people have that this is about shared humanity.\u201d\n\u201cPart of this conversation needs to shine the light on our resistance as Muslim women,\u201d Ms Jawad said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a victim narrative (around Muslim women) that we\u2019re \u2018woe is us, come and save us\u2019, and that\u2019s been a part of the very violence that has been perpetrated against us.\u201d\nA Labour MP has said the government should define Islamophobia to combat \u201cthe racism and vitriol we are seeing by a minority of far-right activists on Britain\u2019s streets\u201d.\nThe government has been approached for a response.", "37108": "title: Big tech firms profit from disorder. Don\u2019t let them use these riots to push for more surveillance \n content: Far-right riots may not be the calmest moment for a reasoned debate about the regulation of big tech, but the eruption of racist violence in England and Northern Ireland raises urgent questions about the responsibilities of social media companies, and how the police use facial recognition technology. While social media isn\u2019t the root of these riots, it has allowed inflammatory content to spread like wildfire and helped rioters coordinate. Keir Starmer has pledged to address online impunity and increase the use of live facial recognition technology. We should applaud the former but be very wary of the latter idea.\nBoth technologies have profound implications for democratic accountability. Take social media. We are used to the adage that what\u2019s illegal in the real world is illegal in the virtual universe too. But in practice, years of cuts to the justice system have left it ill equipped to deal with the growth in racist and inflammatory content online. Explicit violent threats, and incitements to violence, have gone unpoliced, and dangerous and deliberate misinformation has spread. Both can be weapons used by hostile actors, including enemy states.\nThe great elephant in the room is the wealth, power and arrogance of the big tech emperors. Silicon Valley billionaires are richer than many countries. Some believe they can buy current and recently retired politicians, and see themselves as above both democracy and the law. That mature modern states should allow them unfettered freedom to regulate the content they monetise is a gross abdication of duty, given their vast financial interest in monetising insecurity and division. Is Elon Musk the legitimate arbiter of whether Mr Yaxley-Lennon\u2019s social media broadcasts are a threat to public order and security in the UK or anywhere else? Isn\u2019t it time we had judicial processes that would allow for the removal of particular material and the proportionate blocking of certain users?\nSimilar questions arise at the sharp end of law enforcement around the use of facial recognition. In recent years, this technology has been used on our streets without any significant public debate or any parliamentary authorisation. We wouldn\u2019t dream of allowing telephone taps, DNA retention or even stop and search and arrest powers to be so unregulated by the law, yet this is precisely what has happened with facial recognition, thanks to a Conservative government that was casual with both the law and the doling out of public money to private contractors.\nOur facial images are gathered en masse via CCTV cameras, the passport database and the internet. At no point were we asked about this, nor is there any statutory legal basis for it. People are placed on \u201cwatchlists\u201d with no statutory criteria. These lists typically include victims and vulnerable people alongside \u201cpeople of interest\u201d and convicted criminals. Individual police forces have entered into direct contracts with private companies of their choosing, making opaque arrangements to trade our highly sensitive personal data with private companies that use it to develop proprietary technology. And there is no specific law governing how the police, or private companies such as retailers, are authorised to use this technology.\nFacial recognition is incredibly intrusive and capable of achieving complete societal surveillance. It can also create significant injustice, particularly when it\u2019s deployed in real time as opposed to after a crime is captured on camera. Live facial recognition depends on cameras situated in public places that capture everyone who passes by. This increases the risk of false positive matches, where members of the public are incorrectly identified and flagged to police or security staff. Unless that person can then persuade an officer that they\u2019re not the person on the list, they risk facing an intrusive stop and search, or even an arrest.\nThis poses a huge threat to everyone\u2019s civil liberties, but there are further concerns about racial bias. Experts at Big Brother Watch believe the inaccuracy rate for live facial recognition since the police began using it is around 74%, and there are many cases pending about false positive IDs. One involved a black youth worker who was subject to a false match and detained on the street even after he had identified himself to the police. Another involved a teenager (who was also black) who was subject to a search and ejected from a shop after being told that she had been banned. Again, the shop\u2019s facial recognition camera misidentified her. As the post office operators will testify, such are the human dangers of believing in the infallibility of the machine.\nIn Europe the AI act, which came into force in the EU on 1 August, bans the use of live facial recognition in anything but extreme circumstances (such as an imminent terrorist threat). Why doesn\u2019t the UK have something similar? If we want to lead the world in exciting new technologies, we must surely seek to regulate them as our international partners do. The police and the government have so far been silent on this legal black hole.\nWhen corporate lobbyists descend on Liverpool for the first party conference of a new Labour government this September, ministers must not be deterred from making big tech more fairly accountable. Nor should companies be given yet more unaccountable contracts for intrusive technology that replaces legal code with opaque computer code. Total societal surveillance is a dangerous and poor substitute for intelligence-led community cooperation and policing. VIP lanes and cosy chats with billionaires at Bletchley Park must be replaced by parliamentary process and primary legislation. Not only would this protect our liberties under the law, but it could also go some way towards rebuilding people\u2019s trust in politics.\n-\nShami Chakrabarti is a lawyer, Labour member of the House of Lords and the author of Human Rights: The Case for the Defence\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Still, the Islamophobic narrative had already taken hold.\nThe name \"Ali al-Shakati\" was attributed to the alleged attacker, with no official source given to the name. Fact-checkers have since traced it to a dubious Russian-linked fake news outlet masquerading as a legitimate American news site.\nThe claim was picked up by far-right agitators online, including anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.\nControversial influencer Andrew Tate incorrectly said on X that an \"undocumented migrant\" who \"arrived on a boat\" was behind the killings, while Nigel Farage, leader of the far-right Reform UK party, questioned whether police were telling the truth when they said the attack wasn't terror-related.\nThe claims quickly spiralled among xenophobic, far-right groups, who quickly came together to spark riots in more than a dozen towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland.\nStarmer takes swipe at social media\nThe UK government has repeatedly denounced the violence, with Starmer making a series of emergency speeches in which he blasted the \"far-right thuggery\" gripping certain pockets of the UK and announced new measures to crack down on those taking part \u2014 whether directly or from afar.\nIn one speech, the prime minister noted the dangerous role that social media can play in whipping up public disorder, which some saw as him throwing barbs at Elon Musk.\nMusk enters the fray\nCriticism of social media and X in particular for their part in provoking the riots soon began making the rounds online, with much of it aimed at X's owner Elon Musk.\nThe story caught the eye of the tech billionaire, who soon began making his own incendiary remarks against the situation in the UK, such as \"civil war is inevitable\" and likening the country to the Soviet Union.\nAs Starmer and the rest of the UK government continued to update the country on the state of the violent unrest, Musk continued to wade in.\nThe prime minister's spokesperson said there was \"no justification\" for Musk's comments and that social media companies should be doing more to stop the spread of hateful messages.\nAmong his potshots against Starmer, Musk has regurgitated the unsubstantiated idea of different approaches to policing pushed by the likes of Robinson and Farage. Government ministers and police have repeatedly refuted the claim.\nRobinson has since seized on Musk's words and used them to amplify his own as he continues to fan the flames of racism and violence online.\nIn other posts, Musk appears to repeat a claim that has been circulating widely among the far right that the UK media is stacked against them. This is misleading: broadcasters are bound by impartiality rules and regulated by the telecommunications authority Ofcom.\nThe British print and digital news industry on the other hand does not have the same impartiality requirement and newspapers often show their political ideology. However, the vast majority, such as the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, are right-leaning and therefore naturally misaligned with the UK's centre-left Labour government.\nSometimes the Tesla CEO refrains from commenting himself but instead boosts controversial claims made by others.\nHe often responds to posts such as those below with single-word messages expressing his agreement with or approval of what is being said. At other times, he responds with posts such as '!!'.\nDoing so hugely amplifies the original post, owing to his vast following on X (over 190 million followers) and inevitable influence on the algorithm, which has the potential to give misinformation and incendiary messages significant reach online.\nHis posts can easily pick up hundreds of thousands of views.\nMusk is no stranger to courting controversy online. He routinely makes inflammatory remarks on his social media platform about a whole host of topics, including US politics, transgender issues and immigration.\nThanks to his high status and significant sway in the social media world, such comments can easily catch the media spotlight, driving users back to X and ultimately back into Musk's sphere of influence.\nCountries have looked to take more steps to regulate social media in recent years over its potential to facilitate the spread of misinformation and hate speech.\nThe EU recently brought in its Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to take more responsibility for protecting their European users and cleaning up harmful or illegal content and products on their sites, under threat of hefty fines.\nIn the wake of the riots, UK government officials such as Technology Secretary Peter Kyle and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper have hinted that they also have social media companies in their sights.\nDespite the UK passing an Online Safety Act around a year ago, the law is not yet fully in force.", "37507": "title: Artists react to far-right riots in the UK: \u2018More than 'thuggery', it is violent racism' \n content: In the wake of the fatal stabbing of three children at a Taylor Swift-themed event in Southport, near Liverpool, anti-immigration protests have erupted all over the UK.

The suspect has been labelled as a Muslim asylum seeker who recently arrived in the UK by boat, when in fact he was born in Wales to Rwandan parents.\nThe false claim was promoted by EDL (English Defence League) founder Tommy Robinson, and the far-right have taken advantage of the stabbing attack to tap into concerns about the scale of immigration in the UK.\nAnti-fascist demonstrators have held counter-rallies in many cities, including Leeds, where they shouted \"Nazi scum off our streets\", as the far-right protesters chanted, \"You're not English any more\".\nBJ Harrington of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said in a statement on Sunday that 147 people have been arrested since last night in connection with violence and that he expects the number to rise in the coming days.\nIn the wake of these horrendous events, several artists like Massive Attack, Kneecap, Nova Twins and Nadine Shah have reacted to the riots.\nMassive Attack posted a statement on X written by the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank: \u201cThis violent racism has long been simmering under the surface.

The charges related to \u201calleged Facebook posts,\u201d Nick Price, the director of legal services at the CPS, said in a statement.\nIn recent days, rioters have damaged public buildings, set cars on fire and hurled bricks at police officers. They also set ablaze two Holiday Inn hotels in northern and central England believed to be housing asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their claims. Hundreds have been arrested.\nThe riots broke out last week after far-right groups claimed on social media that the person charged with carrying out a horrific stabbing attack that left three children dead was a Muslim asylum seeker. The online disinformation campaign stoked outrage directed at immigrants.\nThe suspect, who has since been named as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, was born in the UK, according to police.\nBut false claims about the attack \u2014 Britain\u2019s worst mass stabbing targeting children in decades and possibly ever \u2014 spread rapidly online and continued garnering views even after the police had set the record straight.\nAccording to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank, by mid-afternoon on July 30, the day after the attack, a false name circulated online for the alleged asylum seeker had received more than 30,000 mentions on X alone from more than 18,000 unique accounts.\n\u201cThe false name attributed to the attacker was circulated organically but also recommended to users by platform algorithms,\u201d the ISD said in a statement.\n\u201cPlatforms therefore amplified misinformation to users who may not otherwise have been exposed, even after the police had confirmed the name was false.\u201d\nAccording to the UK government, bots, which it said could be linked to state-backed actors, may well have amplified the spread of false information.\nTackling \u2018online criminality\u2019\nAlthough social media companies have their own internal policies barring hate speech and incitement to violence from their platforms, they have long struggled to implement them.\n\u201cThe problem has always been enforcement,\u201d Isabelle Frances-Wright, a technology expert at the ISD, told CNN. \u201cParticularly in times of crisis and conflict, when there is a huge groundswell of content, at which point their already fragile content moderation systems seem to fall apart.\u201d\nIt does not help matters that Musk himself has promoted incendiary content on X, a platform that European regulators last month accused of misleading and deceiving users. If he can do it, why not others?\nFor example, shortly after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing outbreak of the war in Gaza, the self-declared \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d publicly endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory popular among White supremacists. Musk later apologized for what he called his \u201cdumbest\u201d ever social media post.\nOn his watch, X has also relaxed its content moderation policies and reinstated several previously blocked accounts. That includes far-right figureheads like Tommy Robinson, who has published a stream of posts stoking the UK protests while criticizing violent attacks.\nThe UK government this week vowed to prosecute \u201conline criminality\u201d and has pushed social media companies to take action against the spread of false information.\n\u201cSocial media has put rocket boosters under\u2026 not just the misinformation but the encouragement of violence,\u201d UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said Monday.\n\u201cThat is a total disgrace and we cannot carry on like this,\u201d she told BBC Radio 5 Live in an interview, adding that the police will be pursing \u201conline criminality\u201d as well as \u201coffline criminality.\u201d\nDuring a cabinet meeting Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said those involved in the riots \u2014 in person and online \u2014 \u201cwill feel the full force of the law and be subject to swift justice,\u201d according to a readout seen by CNN.\nAt the same meeting, Peter Kyle, the minister for science and technology, said that in conversations with social media companies he had made clear their responsibility to help \u201cstop the spread of hateful disinformation and incitement.\u201d\nX, Facebook owner Meta and TikTok have not responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.\nIt is unclear that the UK government has the tools to hold social media platforms accountable for their role in the riots.\nThe UK\u2019s Online Safety Act, adopted last year, creates new duties for social media platforms, including an obligation to take down illegal content when it appears.\nIt also makes it a criminal offense to post false information online \u201cintended to cause non-trivial harm.\u201d\nBut the legislation is not yet in effect because the regulator in charge of upholding it, Ofcom, is still consulting on codes of practice and guidance.\nIn a statement Monday, Ofcom said tackling illegal content online is a \u201cmajor priority.\u201d The watchdog expects the first set of duties under the new Act, regarding illegal content, to go into effect \u201cfrom around the end of this year.\u201d Once the law is in place, Ofcom will be able to fine companies up to 10% of their global revenue.\n\u201cAs part of our wider engagement with tech platforms, we are already working to understand what actions they are taking in preparation for these new rules,\u201d Ofcom added.\nZahid Mahmood, Rob Picheta and Lauren Kent contributed reporting.", "37857": "title: Thousands of counter-protesters rally after riots \n content: Thousands of counter-protesters rally after riots\nThousands of counter-protesters have rallied in cities and towns across England after a week of rioting and disorder.\nGatherings in locations where anti-immigration protests had been expected - including north London, Bristol and Newcastle - were largely peaceful, with counter-protesters chanting \"refugees are welcome here\" forming the bulk of the crowds.\nPolice had been braced for further violence, with thousands of officers deployed and more than 100 events anticipated.\nRioting was sparked by misinformation online that the suspect in the fatal stabbing of three little girls in Southport on 29 July was a Muslim asylum seeker.\nMosques and hotels housing asylum seekers were among places targeted during the disorder, with some shops burnt out and looted.\nOn Wednesday, on high streets across England, shop owners had boarded up windows and closed early in anticipation of further violence.\nImmigration lawyers had been told by police to work from home after lists of solicitors\u2019 firms and advice agencies were shared in chat groups as possible targets.\nBut only a handful of arrests were reported during the evening as demonstrations largely passed off peacefully.\nMore than 400 arrests have been made in relation to the riots, with more than 140 people charged, and some already convicted and sentenced.\nThree men were given jail sentences for their parts in violent disorder in Southport and Liverpool.\nWednesday evening's largely peaceful scenes raise the question of whether those earlier arrests and custodial sentences, and the desire of others to take a stand against the violence, had an impact on anyone intending to begin new riots.\nIn Walthamstow, north London, thousands of people chanted \"Whose streets?

They are not \n content: Yesterday, a horde of far-right racists besieged, attacked and tried to burn down a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham. A mob chanted \u201cburn it\u201d and \u201cset it on fire\u201d as they pushed a flaming bin through a shattered door at the base of the building. Terrified asylum seekers looked down through broken windows upon a crowd calling for their deaths. Similar scenes played out later that day at a hotel in Tamworth.\nThese events made up just a fraction of what is probably the worst week of far-right violence since the second world war. With no central organiser or single group behind this wave of hate, it reflects the nature of the contemporary far right, where trouble on our streets is planned and encouraged by vast decentralised networks of activists online. But while the role of the far right is fundamental, this racist violence has emerged out of an existing climate of prejudice stoked by more mainstream actors.\nThe troubles started on Tuesday when an angry mob rioted and tried to attack a mosque in Southport. Racist violence followed in Hartlepool the following day, then Sunderland on Friday. Remarkably, things escalated further as the weekend began, with far-right \u201cdemonstrations\u201d descending into racist attacks, rioting and looting in Liverpool, Hull, Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday. In the past week, Hope Not Hate has monitored more than 30 events involving racism and the far right.\nWhat we have observed is that, while the trigger for this wave of unprecedented far-right activity was the heartbreaking attack on children in Southport, the planned protests quickly became expressive of wider hostility to multiculturalism, and anti-Muslim and anti-migrant prejudice, as well as a visceral streak of populist anti-government sentiment.\nSeveral incorrect narratives have emerged as these shocking events have unfolded across England. Some initially misattributed the disturbances to the English Defence League (EDL) \u2013 an outfit that ceased operating years ago \u2013 but this wave of demonstrations reflects the increasingly decentralised nature of the current far right. While activists affiliated with traditional far-right organisations have been involved, most of these protests were planned organically, often by local people, who are plugged into decentralised far-right networks online.\nThe shared slogans, language and iconography don\u2019t show that these rioters form a cohesive or coordinated group; rather, it means that their organisers and attenders are often active in overlapping online spaces. Though not centrally organised, the participants are drawing from a common wellspring of anger and often recycle the same slogans \u2013 in particular \u201cenough is enough\u201d, \u201cstop the boats\u201d and \u201csave our children\u201d.\nModern technology, and social media in particular, enables individuals to collaborate towards common political goals independent of traditional organisational structures. These networks lack formal leaders but rather have figureheads, often drawn from a selection of far-right social media \u201cinfluencers\u201d.\nPerhaps most prominent among the range of far-right figures involved in spreading misinformation was Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (AKA Tommy Robinson). Though he is currently on holiday in Aiya Napa, he has been posting on X, criticising Islam and saying that rioters in Southport were \u201cjustified in their anger\u201d. It was no surprise that his name was regularly chanted by rioters at most of this week\u2019s protests as they hurled bricks at mosques and screamed racist slogans.\nThat this wave of violence was organised across a range of social media platforms is further proof that what happens online has a real effect in our communities and on our streets. A number of the figures posting about the attack in Southport, including Lennon and the infamous misogynist Andrew Tate, who wrongly claimed the attacker was an \u201cillegal migrant\u201d and told people to \u201cwake up\u201d, had previously been deplatformed on X (formerly Twitter) but were given their accounts back after Elon Musk took control of the platform. This has resulted in a far-right movement once again being able to reach millions of people.\nWithin moments of the initial attack in Southport on Monday, misinformation about the alleged perpetrator spread across the internet: there were false claims that he was a Muslim, motivated by Islam and that he was an undocumented migrant who recently arrived by boat.\nHowever, while \u201cinfluencers\u201d spread misinformation, we must look at the role of supposedly mainstream actors to understand why so many people were willing to believe these racially motivated lies. This week\u2019s events have emerged out of an existing climate of prejudice that has been fostered for years by elements of our media and supposedly mainstream politicians. Shockingly, even Nigel Farage, now a sitting MP, released a video questioning \u201cwhether the truth is being withheld from us\u201d.\nWhether it is endless newspaper headlines demonising Muslims and asylum seekers, or then-home secretary Suella Braverman describing the arrival of desperate people by boat as an \u201cinvasion\u201d, all have contributed to stoking the hatred that manifested as violence in recent days.\nThere has been talk of banning the EDL as a response to this violence. This wouldn\u2019t be effective, not least because the organisation no longer exists. We won\u2019t ban our way out of this problem. Yes, any individuals who have participated in and encouraged this violence should face justice, but in the long term what\u2019s required is concerted work around societal cohesion, and greater responsibility and accuracy from journalists and politicians when discussing immigration, asylum seekers and the Muslim community.\nFar-right politics is not a tumour that hangs off our body politic, something separate and distinct. It is an infection within it, and one that can spread. Any effective response to the horrors of this past week must take this into account.\nMany people, including media commentators and even politicians, have sought to frame this week of far-right riots as an outpouring of legitimate anger. It is not. There is nothing \u201clegitimate\u201d about trying to burn down a hotel with asylum seekers inside. There is nothing \u201clegitimate\u201d about hurling bricks at mosques or attacking people of colour. This is far-right violence, motivated by a climate of hate and prejudice, and all of those responsible must be held accountable.\n-\nJoe Mulhall is director of research at the anti-fascism organisation Hope Not Hate.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

minimum service legislation and gender among other issues, she has yet to post anything directly addressing the mass unrest that has taken place since the murder of three young girls in

They don\u2019t want to upset the cultural establishment that wants to pretend that nothing is going on.\n\u201cThey should be saying that we need a clearer strategy on integration, which we don\u2019t have at the moment\u201d, she said.\nA spokesperson for Ms Badenoch told The Independent: \u201cThe Tory leadership race will not be determined by who does the most media, but who has the best vision for the future of the Conservative Party.\n\u201cKemi has been touring across the UK this week meeting members, listening to their views on the renewal of our party, and she will continue to do so regardless of these smears.\"\nJames Cleverly\nMr Cleverly came out early to condemn the riots, saying they are \u201can insult to the memory of the victims of this heinous attack\u201d, adding that they are \u201cthe actions of people \u2026 responding to disinformation online\u201d.\nHe said attacks on mosques and hotels were \u201cclearly driven by racism and should be condemned unequivocally right across the board\u201d.\nThe shadow home secretary also questioned Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s announcement of a \u201cstanding army\u201d of specialist police officers, asking if the force means the government expects \u201cpermanent riots\u201d in the UK.\nBut he backed the prime minister\u2019s decision not to recall Parliament, saying such a move is not necessary provided there is a \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cclear\u201d flow of information to MPs.\nRobert Jenrick\nThe former immigration minister urged the government to \u201cback our brave police officers in using the full force of the law without fear or favour to restore order\u201d.\nIn a video posted to X, Mr Jenrick said: \u201cNow is the time to punish the guilty, to lock up the rioters and to take back control of Britain\u2019s streets.\u201d\nBut he sparked outrage this week after saying people shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d on London streets \u201cshould be arrested immediately\u201d.\n\u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d is an Arabic phrase meaning \u201cGod is greater\u201d or \u201cGod is greatest\u201d which is commonly used in prayer and as a declaration of faith.\nThe Muslim Association of Britain dubbed the remarks \u201cpure unadulterated Islamophobia\u201d, while Afzal Khan, Labour MP for Manchester Rusholme, said it is another example of a \u201csenior Tory being Islamophobic\u201d. Conservative peer Baroness Sayeeda Warsi accused the Tory leadership contender of \u201cnasty divisive rhetoric\u201d.\nMel Stride\nMel Stride accused Nigel Farage of stirring up disruption in the wake of the Southport attacks, saying he would not be welcome in the Conservative Party under his leadership.\nHe criticised the Reform UK leader\u2019s response to the riots, saying he was \u201cirresponsible and wrong to fuel the fires\u201d while the UK faced some of the \u201cworst public order offences\u201d in many years.\nThis came after Mr Farage claimed the UK has a system of \u201ctwo-tier policing\u201d, a far-right claim which has been used to justify the disorder, suggesting police are taking a softer approach with left-wing and Islamic protesters than they are with white working-class protesters.\nMr Stride told Sky News the UK needs \u201clevel heads, and moderation as well as very firm action. And we have seen very firm action.\u201d\nPriti Patel\nDame Priti Patel has also distanced herself from comments made about the riots by the Reform UK leader which saw him suggest that the escalation in violence came as a result of \u201csoft policing\u201d during Black Lives Matter protests.\nThe former home secretary told Times Radio there is a \u201cstark difference\u201d between the \u201cthuggery, violence and racism\u201d seen over the last week and the \u201cprotests that were being policed\u201d during the pandemic.\nShe added that \u201ca lot of what we have seen is down to misinformation and social media\u201d, warning it is \u201cirresponsible\u201d to think everything online is factual.\nUnlike Mr Cleverly, Dame Priti called for Parliament to be recalled, as well as accusing Labour of being \u201cbreathtakingly complacent\u201d in their initial response to the unrest.\nTom Tugendhat\nTom Tugendhat has described the events over the last week and a half as being \u201cdark days for our country\u201d, adding: \u201cViolent mobs cannot be allowed to threaten the basic freedoms of our friends and neighbours.\n\u201cThe government must urgently get a grip of the situation and end the lawless behaviour of a few.\u201d\nMr Tugendhat also criticised Labour\u2019s initial response to the riots, on Saturday questioning why a Cobra meeting had not yet been called.\nPosting to social media, he added: \u201cExtremism and lawlessness cannot be tolerated.

But there\u2019s more to the story \u2013 and disillusionment with politics is only just the start, writes Luke Tryl\nDays of unrest across England\u2019s towns and cities \u2013 which have seen mosques targeted, hotels housing asylum seekers attacked, police officers injured and countless acts of vandalism by far-right rioters \u2013 are forcing us to confront an ugly and hateful element in our country.\nWhat should have been a period to come together and mourn after the horrific murders of Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, has been hijacked by thugs and extremists.\nThe question now is what to do about it.\nSome, such as Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, while condemning the violence, have suggested that far-right violence is a reaction to the fear and unease shared by tens of millions of people.\nRight-wing academic Matt Goodwin says we are witnessing \u201cthe direct result of failed policies including \u2018mass uncontrolled immigration\u2019\u201d. Shadow Welsh secretary Lord Davies of Gower (in words he says were misconstrued and which he has apologised for) appeared to imply disorder was justified by Labour opposing the Rwanda Bill.\nOthers have spoken of the \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d of the rioters on issues such as immigration and suggested that this moment needs to be the start of a conversation on those issues.\nIn my view, all of these responses are not only wrong but do a deep disservice to millions of ordinary Britons and their concerns.\nOf course, it is true that people have worries about immigration. Eighty-two per cent of the public say they are concerned about the number of people coming to the UK illegally. A majority think that levels of immigration to the UK need to be reduced.\nAnd disillusionment with politics is far wider than just on the issue of immigration; in focus groups that More in Common runs across the country every week, we hear frustration from people about their relatives being stuck on waiting lists, despair at the soaring price of energy bills and real anger at the sense of \u201cone rule for them\u201d for politicians following scandals like Partygate.\nBut the simple fact is that the vast majority of Britons, whether they are concerned about immigration or the NHS, not only would never dream of taking part in hateful riots but are actively appalled by what they have seen.\nWhen speaking to voters in Leigh in Greater Manchester last week, Robert, a Reform UK voter, summed up the attitude of most ordinary Britons when he said of the rioters: \u201cWe are a country based on rule of law. If we lose that we\u2019re just a bunch of savages, and that\u2019s what those people are, just a reckless bunch of savages.\u201d He was joined by Pat who called the rioters \u201cdisgusting\u201d, and Karin who called them a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\nIn March, we found seven in 10 believe racism remains a serious issue in the UK (including a majority of Reform UK voters). In that same poll over two-thirds of the country (including half of Reform UK voters) said the same of far-right terrorism.\nIn appearing to suggest the rioters may be channelling the concerns of those like Reform UK voters, Farage has done a deeper disservice to them than any of his political opponents. Indeed, if the Conservatives are serious about tackling the threat that Reform UK poses to them, they will seize on this moment to establish themselves firmly as a party unequivocally on the side of law and order.\nIt is also true that some on the left, albeit in less prominent positions, have made a countercase that the riots are the result of Conservative government rhetoric on \u201cstopping the boats\u201d and that the zero-tolerance policy on Channel crossings is to blame.\nThese commentators are guilty of a different problem, which can feed the grievance narrative far-right cheerleaders want to project. Wanting to tackle dangerous Channel crossings is not \u201cfar right\u201d, nor is wanting an immigration policy which finds the right balance between compassion and control, nor is supporting Brexit. We shouldn\u2019t pretend that far-right thugs need excuses in the form of Home Office policy to perpetrate their acts of violence.\nInstead, what needs to happen now begins with restoring law and order. Belief in law and order is one of the central tenets of the British psyche and I have no doubt, not least given the overwhelming majority of Britons favour harsher sentences, that a zero-tolerance approach is one that will find favour.\nWhether these thugs are motivated by far-right ideology or a general desire for violence and disorder, an approach which confronts them with the full force of the policing and criminal justice system is one that will command broad public support.\nThis is not two-tier policing. As Priti Patel \u2013 hardly a champion of the liberal left \u2013 has pointed out, there is a major difference between Black Lives Matter protests, which took place under Covid restrictions, or even disruptive protest activity such as blocking streets, and attacking and vandalising libraries, hotels, and places of worship.\nIndeed, having seen Just Stop Oil protestors sentenced to hefty prison sentences (something supported by the public) it is hard to take any claims of two-tier justice seriously.\nAfter the riots are brought under control, this conversation needs to turn not to immigration \u2013 I have no doubt that debates about immigration will (and should) continue to take place over the next parliament. Instead, we need to have a more serious approach to integration, social cohesion, and counterextremism.\nFor too long we have neglected these issues, with cohesion policy reduced to hoping everyone will be nice to each other. Such wishy-washy notions of social cohesion have done nothing to build the sort of resilient multi-ethnic society most Britons want to see. Doing so means a properly funded three-tier approach.\nThat approach firstly needs to root out extremism \u2013 whether on the far right or elsewhere \u2013 and tackle freedom-restricting harassment. Secondly, it needs to create country-wide expectations on integration that are serious about promoting the British/liberal values of democracy, respect for the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance, values which the rioters have so wantonly disregarded.\nThirdly, it needs to properly tackle social isolation and segregation both in the online and offline space \u2013 starting in our education system.\nThe rioters and their mouthpieces want us to think that Britain is irredeemably broken. It isn\u2019t \u2013 but having handed them the justice they deserve, our focus then needs to turn more seriously to the task of building the more resilient, cohesive society that we overwhelmingly want to live in.\nLuke Tryl is UK director of the More in Common think tank", "39441": "title: Britain\"s violent riots: What we know \n content: LONDON - After days of violent rioting set off by disinformation around a deadly stabbing rampage, authorities in Britain had been bracing for more unrest Wednesday. But by nightfall, large-scale anti-immigration demonstrations had not materialised, and only a few arrests had been made nationwide.\nInstead, streets in cities across the country were filled with thousands of antiracism protesters, including in Liverpool, where by late evening, the counterdemonstration had taken on an almost celebratory tone.\nOver the weekend, the anti-immigration protests, organised by far-right groups, had devolved into violence in more than a dozen towns and cities. And with messages on social media calling for wider protests and counterprotests Wednesday, British authorities were on high alert.\nWith tensions running high, Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s Cabinet held emergency meetings to discuss what has become the first crisis of his recently elected government. Some 6,000 specialist public-order police officers were mobilised nationwide to respond to any disorder, and authorities in several cities and towns stepped up patrols.\nWednesday was not trouble-free, however.\nIn Bristol, police said there was one arrest after a brick was thrown at a police vehicle and a bottle was thrown. In the southern city of Portsmouth, police officers dispersed a small group of anti-immigration protesters who had blocked a roadway. And in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where there have been at least four nights of unrest, disorder continued, and the police service said it would bring in additional officers.\nBut overall, many expressed relief that the fears of wide-scale violence had not been realised.\nHere is what we know about the turmoil in Britain.\nWhere has the unrest taken place?\nProtesters over the weekend took to the streets of a dozen cities across Britain, most of them in England. Trouble broke out from Aldershot in the south to Sunderland in the north and Liverpool in the west. Belfast, in Northern Ireland, was also drawn into the fray.\nIn some cases, the protesters were merely unruly, but in others the violence was more pronounced.\nOn Sunday, rioters set upon a hotel that was housing asylum-seekers in the town of Rotherham, in northern England, breaking windows before surging inside as police struggled to control them. No guests were injured in the melee, police said.\nIn Middlesbrough, a group of rioters, some masked, hurled bottles and rocks at officers. Cars were set on fire, and at least nine people were arrested. On Saturday, a library and a food bank were set ablaze in Liverpool as groups damaged and looted businesses, and in Hull, fires were set, and storefronts smashed in the city centre.\nDozens of police officers were injured, including some who required trips to the hospital.\nWhat set off the protests?\nThe unrest began after a teenager wielding a knife attacked a children\u2019s dance class early last week in the seaside town of Southport, which is near Liverpool. Three children were killed, and eight were wounded.\nThe suspect was born and raised in Britain, but online rumours soon circulated that he was an immigrant in the country without legal authorisation. To counter those false claims, authorities took the unusual step of publicly identifying him. The BBC has reported that the suspect\u2019s parents are from Rwanda. Police have not disclosed a motive for the stabbing attack.\nBut with migration a flashpoint issue in Britain, especially on the far right, the rumours were all it took to set off violence.\nExtremist groups urged their followers to take to the streets, and on the day after the stabbings, they began to do so, starting in Southport.\nHow have authorities responded?\nThe weekend riots prompted a heavy police response. Nearly 4,000 additional officers were deployed, a law enforcement association said. And a government order gave officers in some places special powers to disperse any gatherings or \"antisocial behaviour,\" police said in a statement.\nPolice officers stand watch as antiracism protesters gather in Liverpool, England, on Wednesday. (Photo: New York Times)\nMore than 400 people have been arrested, and about 100 have been charged, Starmer said after an emergency Cabinet meeting Tuesday \u2014 the second in two days.\nThe prime minister, who has characterised the riots as \"far-right thuggery,\" encouraged prosecutors to name and shame those convicted to dissuade others from joining the violent rampages.\n\"I'm now expecting substantive sentencing before the end of the week,\" Starmer said. \"That should send a very powerful message to anybody involved, either directly or online, that you are likely to be dealt with within a week and that nobody, but nobody, should involve themselves in this disorder.\"\nBJ Harrington, the head of public order for Britain's National Police Chiefs' Council, said that online disinformation had been \"a huge driver of this appalling violence.\"\nIntelligence teams, detectives and neighbourhood officers, Harrington said, were working to identify the people fomenting the violence.\n\"They won't win,\" he said.\nHow are authorities handling online incitement?\nSocial media has acted as an accelerant throughout the protests, with disinformation fuelling far-right and anti-immigrant groups. Britain and other democracies have found that policing the internet is legally murky terrain, with individual rights and free speech protections balanced against a desire to block harmful material.\nIn his remarks Tuesday, Starmer said that some arrests involved people accused of inciting violence online.\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer. (Photo: Reuters)\nThe first person to be convicted over online posts since the riots, according to the Crown Prosecution Service, was a 28-year-old man from Leeds who posted messages on Facebook about attacking a hotel that housed asylum-seekers. It said that the man, Jordan Parlour, had pleaded guilty and was convicted of using threatening words or behaviour to stir up racial hatred.\nStarmer has also called out social media companies over misinformation on their platforms but holding them accountable could be tricky. Britain adopted a law last year that requires social media companies to introduce protections for child safety and to prevent and quickly remove illegal content such as terrorism propaganda and revenge pornography. The law is less clear about how companies must treat misinformation and incendiary language.\nWhat are the political implications?\nThe riots are the first political crisis for Starmer, who took office a month ago after his Labour Party defeated the Conservatives, who had been in government for 14 years.\nWhile in power, the Conservatives tried to capitalise on public unhappiness over immigration, vowing to reduce it (though failing to do so). But in recent days they joined Labour in condemning the violent protests.\nFormer Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, now the opposition leader, said the unrest had \"nothing to do with the tragedy in Southport.\" Police, he said, have \"our full support to deal with these criminals swiftly.\"\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "39528": "title: \u2018People just like rioting\u2019: why swift justice may blur real motivations behind UK rampage \n content: Last Sunday afternoon a homeless mother-of-five left her hotel room in Middlesbrough to nip to a nearby shop. On her way, 34-year-old Stacey Vint bumped into some locals she knew and joined them on their way to what had been described on social media as a \u201cpro-British\u201d protest in the town centre.\nFive days later, she found herself being handed a 20-month prison sentence for violent disorder after becoming part of a 1,000-strong riot that saw police attacked as homes, cars and public buildings were vandalised.\nA barrister representing Vint, who had drunk alcohol and smoked cannabis on the day, told Teesside crown court that her involvement was \u201csimple\u201d.\n\u201cOne of the group she was with asked her to give him a hand with a wheelie bin, which had been set on fire, and she did,\u201d Andrew Turton said. \u201cStupidly, she took hold of the bin, pushed it towards police, and fell at their feet.\u201d\nA 10-second video of the incident, which had already gone viral amid ridicule on social media, showed Vint and an unidentified man wheel the burning bin towards a line of officers, before it slid out of control and dragged her to the ground.\nThe smashed windows at Teesside crown court were still boarded up as the judge, Francis Laird KC, sentenced Vint, telling her the \u201clarge-scale act of public disorder\u201d had caused significant physical and financial damage to her home town, traumatised police officers and terrified residents.\nThe judge found that Vint had no racist or ideological motivation for her offence, but that her sentence had to be increased because of the riot\u2019s scale, impact and the \u201cbackdrop of other violent incidents\u201d across the country.\nThe court heard that Vint\u2019s life had been blighted by drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence, and that she had become homeless after fleeing an abusive relationship and seeing all five of her children taken into care.\nAs Vint sat impassively in the dock, wearing a grey prison tracksuit, Turton said she had \u201cexpressed shame and regret\u201d and \u201cunderstood the need for the court to impose deterrent sentences\u201d.\nSuch sentences were being handed out at remarkable speed at courts across England and Wales on Friday, with Vint just one of more than 300 people so far charged with offences linked to violent protests and riots that broke out following the killing of three young girls in Southport on 29 July. Initially fuelled by false online claims that the perpetrator was a Muslim small-boat migrant, far-right influencers and conspiracy theorists called for people to take to the streets and amplified planned protests in dozens of towns and cities.\nAlthough the misinformation was debunked within a day, demonstrations advertised on multiple social media platforms under vague slogans including \u201cenough is enough\u201d, \u201csave our kids\u201d and \u201cprotect our country\u201d became a vehicle for wider anti-Muslim, racist and xenophobic rage.\nBut at Teesside crown court on Friday, there was little exploration of rioters\u2019 motivation. Evidence of an offender\u2019s mindset is not needed to prove the crime of violent disorder, nor other common charges against rioters such as assault and criminal damage.\nAlso being sentenced alongside Vint was 21-year-old Charlie Bullock, who was seen launching rocks towards police with his face covered by a balaclava during the Middlesbrough riot. He fought the police who tried to arrest him, and when eventually detained told them: \u201cI couldn\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d He was jailed for 18 months, with the sentence having been reduced because of his young age and evidence that his behaviour may have been affected by a failure to take ADHD medication.\nLike Vint, he had refused to answer any questions in his police interview and pleaded guilty to violent disorder without giving evidence in court, but was also found not to have any racial or ideological motivation.\nWhen the time came to sentence a third rioter, who had thrown bricks at police in Darlington on Monday 5 August, the issue could not be so easily resolved.\nCole Stewart, 18, admitted launching the missiles at a line of officers keeping protesters away from a mosque, but claimed a police van was his target and that he held no racist or far-right views. \u201cHe came across the protest, having consumed alcohol, and got involved because everybody else was doing it,\u201d said defence barrister Gary Wood. But prosecutors told the court the offence was a \u201cracially motivated attack\u201d and that the teenager\u2019s sentence should be increased accordingly. Judge Laird said a \u201ctrial of issue\u201d would be held if agreement could not be reached.\nTwo other rioters due to be sentenced last Friday had their cases delayed, including a man who was driven from HMP Darlington to Newcastle, instead of Middlesbrough, \u201cin error\u201d and another inmate who refused to leave his prison cell.\nKeir Starmer has promised \u201cswift justice\u201d for those who engage in disorder, having overseen the controversial use of 24-hour courts and ramped-up sentences for more than 2,000 adults and children convicted over the 2011 riots as director of public prosecutions.\nLegal experts are urging the current government to learn the lessons of that response, and not to repeat the Conservatives\u2019 failure to fully investigate the drivers of that disorder.\nTim Newburn, a criminology professor at the London School of Economics, said that \u201cprocedural speed\u201d and punishment had been prioritised over a deeper assessment of how and why the 2011 riots spread.\n\u201cThe danger in all of these cases is that we reach for a simplistic explanation and that comes to dominate,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is the potential that what\u2019s beginning to be revealed in the court is more complex than the political or general narrative. A failure to investigate is to fail to take the opportunity to mitigate future problems.\u201d\nDr Hannah Quirk, a reader in criminal law at King\u2019s College London, said that history has shown that \u201cpeople just like rioting \u2026 some have really nasty motives and some are just vulnerable and get caught up in it\u201d.\nShe said that the current disorder was much smaller in scope than 2011, but had been similarly \u201clocalised\u201d and exacerbated by allegations of racially biased policing.\nThom Brooks, professor of law and government at Durham University, said that the \u201cextraordinary\u201d speed of sentencing was being enabled by a wave of guilty pleas, and may slow when more complex cases reach the courts. \u201cThere has been huge effort to get cases in court right away for the obvious reason of deterring people,\u201d he added. \u201cPolice and prosecutors also seem to be conducting a social media campaign seeing people named and shamed.\u201d\nMinutes after Vint and Bullock were jailed on Friday, Cleveland Police published their mugshots alongside news of their sentences on Facebook. The posts were met by a chorus of jokes, celebratory comments and applause emojis. Bullock\u2019s mother was the only show of support at Teesside Crown Court, holding her head in her hands as his sentence was passed before trying to speak to the teenager as he was taken down to the cells.\nAs she was helped out of the courtroom by a friend, staff were already preparing for Monday, when a new group of rioters will stream into the dock to hear their fate.", "39947": "title: Starmer is being tough on the rioters, but history shows that preventing further unrest is the real challenge \n content: Britain\u2019s 2024 riots are a surprise national crisis. There was no particular buildup, no clearly discernible pressure cooker process. No one appears to have warned that riots were imminent. Plenty of efforts, some irresistible but some dubious, have now been made to explain them. Yet, more than a week after the first violence in Southport, Britain is only at the start of an agreed and effective response.\nThis is almost always the way with riots. Riots take many forms. Almost always, though, they come as a shock. Nevertheless, riots are not unknown, either in postwar Britain or in British history more generally. The idea that Britain enjoyed a seamlessly peaceful path towards the blessings of parliamentary democracy, tolerance and the rule of law is simply untrue. There was never a riot-free golden age. But each generation is surprised anew.\nYears ago, researching a book on the 1981 Brixton and Toxteth riots, the length of some of these arcs struck me forcefully. In that summer, London, Liverpool and other cities were battered by riots that did \u00a3216m worth of damage at 2024 prices, and led to more than 3,000 arrests, many of black people. These events, though, were occurring, almost to the day, on the 600th anniversary of the Peasants\u2019 Revolt of 1381, in which armed crowds marched from rural England and took over the capital city for three days, looting and burning as they did so.\nIn 1981, a mainly black British march protesting about what was dubbed the New Cross massacre, in which 13 young people died in an arson attack, clashed with police trying to prevent them from crossing London\u2019s Blackfriars Bridge. Not only were those 20th-century protesters facing exactly what a massive and angry Deptford unemployed march of 1886 had also encountered from the police as they also tried to cross the Thames, they were echoing the long distant battle that occurred as Jack Cade\u2019s Kentish rebels fought their way across London Bridge in 1450.\nThe riots of 2024 are very different. Their motivation and their aims are racist. There has been racist rioting in Britain\u2019s past too, including against African-Caribbean people, Jews, Irish and Catholics. But there are also other similarities that unite most forms of rioting, past and present, whatever their motivation. Most rioters are young men. Most riots take place in urban areas. Most take place in the evening or at night \u2013 the dark favours violence and drinking. Most take place in good weather. Many trigger opportunist crimes such as looting and arson.\nRiots are invariably a challenge to the state. They pose, in the most direct form, the question of whether the state can carry out its fundamental tasks of maintaining individual freedom, the public peace and enforcement of the rule of law. If it cannot, the legitimacy of the state comes into question. That was obviously true in 1381, when Richard II\u2019s crown itself was at risk. But it was also true for Margaret Thatcher in 1981, and it is true for Keir Starmer in 2024.\nStarmer\u2019s task is twofold. On the one hand, he must reassert the rule of law and public order over the rioters. This is the absolute precondition for everything else that may now be required, so it must inevitably come first. Starmer\u2019s language has been unequivocal so far. He grasps that he must grip the situation and be seen to do so. If the state\u2019s authority is not upheld, nothing else is certain.\nOne option for Starmer is to summon the army. He would be right to be cautious. Even if they were armed, which they might be, soldiers could not be permitted to deviate from police tactics and orders. And bringing in the army might seem like a premature embrace of an act of last resort that could expose a new prime minister to charges of weakness.\nAnother would be to give the police more destructive weaponry. Boris Johnson wanted water cannon to deal with riots, but sceptical police chiefs and the then home secretary Theresa May stopped him. Starmer will be cautious too, not least because he knows how often the use of weapons with the power to disable could make things worse in Northern Ireland.\nInstead, Starmer is focused on the criminal justice system. He seems to be starting to get his way here. About 400 arrests have been made. Others will follow. Courts have sat quickly, and are beginning to impose heavy sentences. It is claimed that prison places will be made available as a priority. One Southport rioter, Derek Drummond, 58, was jailed for three years yesterday on violent disorder and assault charges, even after handing himself in and pleading guilty. Two others were jailed for 30 and 20 months respectively. They are likely to be the first of many.\nCourts often impose heavy sentences after riots, sometimes excessively. They are under public and political pressure to do this now. Riot, damage and assault are serious offences, carrying heavy maximum sentences. This may have an immediate deterrent effect. Once defendants who wore scarves or balaclavas in the 2024 riots realise that the online instruction to \u201cmask up\u201d can be taken by courts as an aggravating factor in sentencing under public order laws, others may grasp how much they are risking. If the government exempted all riot-related convictions from the plan to reduce prison terms to 40% of sentence served from September, Starmer would strengthen the point further.\nBut being strong in the aftermath of riots is not sufficient. In 1981, Thatcher was adamant that the riots were purely criminal acts. She refused to allow that they might have had causes. \u201cNothing can justify, nothing can excuse and no one can condone the appalling violence,\u201d she announced. She was upbraided not just by Labour, which argued that the riots were a response to economic and social deprivation that she was determined to ignore, but by the Times. \u201cShe failed to raise the tone of her remarks to the level of events,\u201d it said. \u201cNot for the first time she was unable to strike the right note when a broad sense of social understanding was required.\u201d\nStarmer has a second task of this kind. He has to find a way of ensuring that such events are less likely in the future. This is a much longer term challenge, and the possible solutions go beyond the use of criminal law. Again, there are many options. He can take punitive action against rightwing influencers and organisations. He can make life more difficult for the social media sites that they use. He can look for ways to move asylum seekers from vulnerable urban hotels in towns to more easily defended sites. He should do all three. They are not mutually exclusive.\nHis biggest challenge, though, is to start the process of doing what few western governments have managed to do. He must find ways of reducing rather than fanning public anxieties about migration, but without legitimising either the rioters or their hatred. No one pretends that this will be easy. He would be starting a new national conversation in a place which the country should never have been brought to under the previous government. But it cannot be ignored or treated in the old way. If it is, the riots will happen again \u2013 just as they eventually did after 1981.\n-\nMartin Kettle is a Guardian columnist\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Nigel Farage and Elon Musk\u2019s claims debunked as UK faces more riots\nCritics and the far right have claimed previous protests - including those in 2011 after the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan and the Black Lives Matters demonstrations in 2020 - were policed \u2018more favourably\u2019 than racist demonstrations that have spanned the UK since murders in Southport\nSupport truly\nindependent journalism\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\nLouise Thomas\nEditor\nKeir Starmer has hit back at Nigel Farage after he accused police in the UK of carrying out \u2018two-tier policing\u2019 in their response to ongoing far-right riots.\nViolent scenes have erupted in the last week following the killings of three young girls in Southport by 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana. Several others were injured in the attack, with the suspect due to stand trial in January.\nMisinformation became rife following the tragic incident, with false reports of Rudakubana\u2019s religion and migration status shared widely on social media. Far-right rioters took to the streets of Southport on the day after the attack, clashing with police and causing severe damage to the town.\nThis was followed by more than 20 similar events over the weekend. During and after the riots, police have arrested more than 400 people. Dozens of police officers have also been injured, with rioters often targeting them. A number of the far right protests have involved racist or Islamaphobic chants, with some participants seen making Nazi salutes, while black and Asian people have been attacked in broad daylight.\nResponding to the police response to the disorder, Mr Farage said: \u201cThe impression of two-tier policing has become widespread\u201d, adding: \u201cThe Prime Minister\u2019s faltering attempts to address the current crisis have only added to that sense of injustice.\u201d\nThe term \u2018two-tier policing\u2019, often spread by far-right conspiracists and now being peddled by Elon Musk on Twitter, refers to how police handle different groups in society. The baseless claim, often illustrated with cherry-picked incidents that ignore others, is that forces are being more heavy-handed with people on the right than the left.\nThe prime minister has said this is a \u201cnon-issue,\u201d and that policing in the UK is carried out \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d and experts say the two-tier term is not only wrong, but dangerous and misleading.\nRuth Ehrlich, Head of Policy and Campaigns at Liberty, said: \u201cPoliticians and media should not be equating legitimate protest movements \u2013 calling for social progress and social justice \u2013 with what we are seeing today. Which is really Islamaphobic and racist movements that are causing destruction up and down the country.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the law on protesting in the UK?\nCrucially, protest is not illegal. Freedom of expression and assembly are protected rights under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), which the UK is beholden to.\nIt is when an assembled group becomes violent or begins to carry out unlawful acts \u2013 or at least plans to \u2013 that police can lawfully step in. A person\u2019s right to protest can be restricted to prevent crime or disorder, protect public health, or protect the rights of others.\nA senior police officer can also put conditions on a protest if they believe serious public disorder or damage could be caused, the community could be disrupted, too much noise could be generated, or intimidation may occur.\nBut there is a difference between peaceful protest, and what has been happening in the UK over the past week. Ms Ehrlich explains: \u201cThese people are not protesting, they are rioting. And that is a different area of law.\u201d\nIn the UK, people are charged for specific criminal offences relating to their actions. A person can be guilty of violent disorder or a riot if they \u201cuse or threaten unlawful violence\u201d which causes anyone to fear for their \u201cpersonal safety.\u201d Participants may also be charged with specific incidents of assault criminal damage or arson, among others.\nWere police \u2018soft\u2019 on Black Lives Matter protesters?\nThe 2020 Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests were largely peaceful events, with the two key organisers \u2013 Black Lives Matter UK and Stand Up To Racism \u2013 not found by authorities to have incited attendees to act aggressively.\nBetween May and June 2020, there were around 135 arrests across a reported 200 protests. This was largely in central London, as protesters clashed with police on a few separate dates in June.\nThese isolated incidents mostly saw people charged with offences related to assault, disorder, criminal damage or Covid distancing laws. The latter was often related to defacing statues or government buildings, a practice that became divisive at the height of the protests.\nResponding to the protests, former prime minister Boris Johnsons said at the time : \u201cracist violence has no place in our society,\u201d but added that all actions should take place \u201cin accordance with the rules on social distancing.\u201d\nOn a few occasions, protesters clashed with counter-protesters who were in attendance to \u2018protect\u2019 monuments such as London\u2019s cenotaph. Those carrying out criminal damage would largely choose targets related to Britain\u2019s colonial past \u2013 such as Bristol\u2019s Edward Colston statue.\nThese protests were not free from police response, Ms Ehrlich says: \u201cIt is complete nonsense to say that we have not seen heavy-handed policing of legitimate forms of protest in recent years.\n\u201cWithout wanting to suggest [the far-right riots and BLM protests] are comparable events, we saw examples of excessive force being used on protesters, we saw kettling. What we are seeing in these situations today is people taking to the streets, that\u2019s spreading very quickly. It\u2019s just a completely different movement from the BLM protests.\u201d\nHow were the 2011 riots policed?\nIn August 2011, riots broke out in London, soon spreading to pockets all over the UK. The action began as public anti-racist protests in response to the fatal shooting of 29-year-old Mark Duggan, but certain groups then mobilised over the following days to become violent and disorderly.\nThe most severe disorder took place in London, as rioters clashed with police, destroyed vehicles, and looted shops. Incidents continued from August 6 to 11, with news footage showing police struggling to combat the growing violence.\nIn the aftermath, many critics said police did not act quickly or effectively enough to curb the violence. Public opinion was split on whether the police used enough force, but human rights\u2019 charity Liberty said at the time that it was \u201cproportionate.\u201d\nMore than 3,000 people were arrested during the disorder, and 186 police officers injured. The Criminal Prosecution Service (CPS), led at the time by Sir Keir, responded severely.\nEmergency legislation was introduced to open courts for 24-hours, as thousands of people were processed. Sentences were 25 percent higher than usual on average, with experts saying it seemed the government was seeking to make an example of would-be rioters.\nIn another unprecedented move, bail was denied for all of those awaiting trial. It is understood this was to prevent the spread of further disorder. Of those arrested, 78 percent had a previous caution or conviction.\nIt\u2019s likely many of the emergency measures will be used as the CPS works to sentence those involved in the far-right riots over the past few days.", "40437": "title: I was at the Rotherham riots - this is what the far-right had to say for themselves \n content: I was at the Rotherham riots \u2013 this is what the far-right had to say for themselves\nThe rioters are definitely, absolutely not racist.

Someone noble? Courageous? Someone willing to put themselves at risk to defend and protect others? Someone with a moral compass who won\u2019t just accept injustice? Well, if you\u2019d been at yesterday\u2019s riot in Rotherham you\u2019d have been spoilt for choice.\nYou might have got the wrong end of the stick from seeing the footage of the trouble and thought you were watching mob violence \u2013 a bunch of vigilante vandals intimidating and terrorising a minority group, as well as the broader community \u2013 but, according to the people I spoke to yesterday, you\u2019d be wrong.\nThey weren\u2019t just smashing up the hotel, threatening the safety of those inside, setting fires and damaging the property of homeowners. No. These people were moral crusaders, fighting to save their country from \u201cinvasion\u201d. Standing up for the freedoms for which their fathers and grandfathers had fought. The rioters were \u201cpatriots\u201d. People with the courage of their convictions, speaking truth to power and protecting women and girls from \u201csexual predators\u201d.\nI should feel grateful, one man admonished me as he adjusted the neck fastening of the St George\u2019s flag he was wearing as a cape. \u201cOr\u201d, he asked as he swigged from his can of lager, \u201cdo you want to be raped?\u201d The conversation had taken a dark turn. I have to say, for someone claiming to protect and defend me, he wasn\u2019t half making me feel uneasy.\nIf that\u2019s the response to the people they\u2019re purporting to defend then I was genuinely fearful for the people they were targeting. \u201cEnough is enough, love.\u201d he said. \u201cEnough is enough. Something needs to be done. This is a start.\u201d\n\u201cEnough is enough of what, though?\u201d I genuinely didn\u2019t understand. I went to secondary school in Wath during the Nineties and my family live on the Manvers estate, the site of yesterday\u2019s violence, and I still live nearby.\nMy teenage niece and nephew have gone to watch residents play cricket many times and they have nothing but good things to say about the people they\u2019ve met. My own experience of the hotel\u2019s residents is similar \u2013 and nothing but polite.\nOn two occasions, young men from the hotel have helped me to get my disabled mum into the car when we were struggling. So I was surprised to hear one rioter\u2019s claim that women on the estate are scared to go out because of harassment by the residents.\nApparently, girls who go to Manvers Lake are approached \u201cconstantly\u201d by the residents. \u201cThey need sending back,\u201d he concluded. I said that my teenage nieces \u2013 who\u2019ve lived on the estate for years and regularly meet friends at the lake \u2013 say they\u2019ve never been harassed or approached by residents at the hotel and never seen that happen to anyone else either.\n\u201cWhat about the Rotherham sex abuse then? All them girls, raped,\u201d he countered. \u201cBut what\u2019s that got to do with the residents of this hotel?\u201d I wondered aloud\u2026 \u201cListen, f*** off, love.\u201d he said. And that was the end of that conversation.\nI went to what was advertised \u2013 disingenuously, in my opinion \u2013 on social media as a \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d. I knew it would be anything but peaceful. Apparently, the organisers were \u201cdevastated\u201d that the demonstration had turned nasty \u2013 but it didn\u2019t seem that unexpected to me.\nIn the current context, when mosques are being targeted on the pretext of \u201cprotesting\u201d the appalling deaths in Southport \u2013 perpetrated by a British-born Christian \u2013 it seems like it\u2019s any excuse for racists to attack anyone they think is Muslim.\nBut no, I was told. The rioters were definitely, absolutely not racist. Someone\u2019s aunty was black so they were definitely, absolutely not racist. In fact, it was racist of me to bring up the issue of race. This was said while racial slurs were shouted up at the shattered windows of the hotel.\nWhat, then, makes someone decide to spend their Sunday outside a hotel full of strangers they\u2019ve never met, with no knowledge of their backstories or what they\u2019re going through, to shout and scream about how much you hate them; how much you wish they\u2019d leave; accusing them of rape and child abuse; smashing windows and doors to get into the hotel and attempting to set fire to the building? The answer, I was told, was that the hotel is \u201cfull of nonces\u201d. Right.\nThere were little kids in that hotel. Families. So much for protecting the children, eh?\nMy sense was that the riot felt more like a hooligans\u2019 p**s-up rather than any form of protest. The atmosphere was febrile and the hatred tangible.\nI\u2019ve read reports that the riots are an expression of legitimate anger about social injustice. I know that people in my local area are angry. I\u2019m angry.\nIt\u2019s 40 years since the miners\u2019 strikes and we\u2019re still reeling from the social violence of the pit closures. We\u2019ve got unemployment, substance abuse issues, poverty and town centres that have more boarded-up shops than ones that are trading. I get it. The deprivation of the area stems from the closure of the mining industry and the government\u2019s failure to create any meaningful employment in its place. We see the results of that neglect all around us every day.\nIt\u2019s ironic, then, that the Manvers estate, where yesterday\u2019s riot took place, is built on a former colliery. Some of the staunchest defenders of yesterday\u2019s violence have claimed to be ex-miners involved in the strikes of 1984, attempting to compare the two as morally equivalent protests. But the riots of 2024 couldn\u2019t be more different.\nForty years ago, local miners risked poverty and repossession to fight against governmental power for their livelihoods and their communities. That was courageous. In 2024, masked rioters attack a hotel because they think it houses some people who are Muslim.\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on the sudden desire to protect women and girls from sexual violence \u2013 that\u2019s just an attempt to give the violence a veneer of moral respectability. The grooming scandal gives the rioters what they consider to be moral justification for attacking immigrants.\nWhere\u2019s the anger about the epidemic of sexual violence we\u2019re currently facing? Oh, that\u2019s right. Because it\u2019s not really about protecting women and girls at all. As one of the residents put it: \u201cMe and my daughters have never felt unsafe here with the people in the hotel but yesterday the English protesters made us feel very unsafe. I felt absolutely ashamed to live here yesterday.\u201d\nThis morning, another resident told me: \u201cVolunteers are out helping to clear the mess up and hopefully the people in the hotel will see and know that we aren\u2019t all like the scum that came yesterday.\u201d While another said: \u201cThe police did a brilliant job of standing firm and calmly but in the end residents went out with buckets of water and put fires out and told them to go home.\u201d\nMeanwhile, on social media, a hotel resident asked if they could join the community tidy-up efforts (and were welcomed) with the qualifier that they shouldn\u2019t have to clear up a mess they didn\u2019t make. But that\u2019s real courage, isn\u2019t it? After being targeted with all that hatred and violence, to respond with such generosity and grace.

Police descended on high streets and residential roads, and locals showed up too, ready for the worst.\nIt was meant to be another night of violence at the hands of the far right. A list of target addresses for far-right protests, seen by CNN, had been circulating on Telegram channels and then on social media for days, raising alarm that the racist attacks on Muslims and asylum seekers over the weekend would return.\nBut then the counter-protests started. Anti-racism rallies stole back the narrative and kept away far-right antagonists, and a nervous country breathed a huge sigh of relief after a night that could have felt very different.\nWednesday felt like a turning point after a string of violence that had put a country on edge and thrown its new government into a sudden crisis.\n\u201cThey\u2019re nowhere to be seen,\u201d Ahmed Hussain, 31, told CNN from a Walthamstow site in north London that had expected far-right violence, and instead saw a sizeable counter-protest that became a symbol of Wednesday\u2019s grassroots response. \u201cIt shows that when everyone comes out to support, their numbers dwindle.\u201d\nBut the government says it remains on high alert for more unrest this weekend. The fury simmering in a subset of White Britain remains a live danger; these riots were shocking, but not entirely surprising.\n\u201cI normally walk through this city center all the time,\u201d Nadeem Akhtar, 18, told CNN in the northern English city of Sheffield, where angry riots took place. \u201cBut now, recently, even my mum\u2019s been saying to me, don\u2019t be going out so much, because you never know what could happen.\u201d\nAnd the causes that aided and enabled the racist violence \u2013 misinformation, anti-migrant rhetoric in Britain\u2019s media and politics, a hobbled police force and stuffed prisons and courts \u2013 will take far longer than a night to fix.\n\u201cThese are all events that have been bubbling up over the past 15 years,\u201d Jesse Bernard, 34, told CNN in Walthamstow, reflecting on the weekend\u2019s violent riots and the prevalence of the far right. \u201cIt was bound to happen.\u201d\n\u201cThe chickens come home to roost,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a country, this is a bed that we\u2019ve made, and now we\u2019re sleeping in it.\u201d\nOnline provocateurs and far-right foot soldiers\nFittingly, after a week of misinformation-fuelled fury, the origin and authenticity of the list of supposed far-right targets on Wednesday isn\u2019t clear.\nThe addresses included were mainly immigration centers and lawyers dealing with migration cases. It was a scattershot collection, seemingly collated with little knowledge of the local areas; some were offices based in non-descript business parks; others on quiet, residential streets.\nBut after a weekend of ugly anger on Britain\u2019s streets, in which hotels housing asylum seekers were set on fire by racist mobs, it quickly went viral: first on Telegram channels used by the far right, then across social media, and among the communities that appeared to be targets. A huge police operation across the country was launched; in the end, few far-right disruptors showed up anywhere.\nMisinformation on social media has added an element of unpredictability to the far right\u2019s organization.\nLeading platforms, especially X, have provided new soapboxes to incendiary figures intent on stirring anti-migrant sentiment. In many cases, their posts are eagerly shared and viewed by the far-right foot soldiers who joined the weekend\u2019s riots \u2013 even if the authors quietly condemn violence after the fact.\nTommy Robinson, the figurehead of Britain\u2019s far right, was reinstated to X (then Twitter) days after Elon Musk bought the platform. Robinson, whose profile picture shows him with tape across his mouth, has nearly a million followers.\nAlmost every one of his tweets is an anti-migrant tirade, frequently using dehumanizing and othering language to describe the high rate of legal and illegal migration to the UK.\nThose themes are echoed by other high-profile Twitter users, like provocateur Laurence Fox, who hosted a show on the right-wing GB News TV channel until he was fired last October for demeaning the appearance of a female journalist on air. Amid the weekend\u2019s riots, Fox told his followers: \u201cIslam needs to be removed from Britain. Completely and entirely.\u201d\nStarmer has become an enemy in the eyes of the far right over the past week, but he has little ability to quell a right-wing and far-right online ecosystem that exists in private messaging apps and, increasingly, on public sites accessible by anyone.\nAnd remarkably, the first spat that Britain\u2019s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer found himself engaged in was with Musk himself, who has taken an interest in goading Starmer on his platform.\nMusk tweeted Sunday that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in Britain \u2013 a prediction most Brits would scoff at, and one that prompted an unusually direct rebuke from the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson, who told reporters there was \u201cno justification\u201d for the comments.\nA legal blitz\nBritain\u2019s far-right rioting broke out less than a month into the tenure of its new prime minister, but Starmer has been here before.\nFormerly Britain\u2019s highest-ranking prosecutor, Starmer oversaw a rapid legal response to the 2011 rioting that broke out after the shooting of a Black man by police in north London. Courts stayed open 24 hours and sentences were well publicized, in an effort not just to deal justice but to send a message.\nHe has reached for the same playbook this week. There have been hundreds of arrests, and already dozens of rioters have been charged and sent to begin hefty prison terms, ranging from several months to nearly three years. Their ages, so far, span from 16 to 69. Some judges\u2019 sentencing remarks have been broadcast live, a novel tactic in a country where courtroom cameras are a recent and heavily restricted phenomenon.\nEarly signs suggest the legal blitz has worked in deterring far-right supporters from taking to the streets.\nIt has also led to a moniker \u2013 \u201ctwo-tier Keir\u201d \u2013 among those far-right groups, who claim Starmer is using tougher rhetoric on the far right than he did against other protesters, like climate activists.\nStarmer will be unbothered by that fringe grievance. But there are wider inequalities that gave rise to the unrest which will take years to resolve.\nRiots took hold disproportionately in cities and towns suffering from high levels of deprivation; places where, over recent years, people have increasingly seen the creaking foundations of the British state through a lens that focuses unforgivingly on migration.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a doctor\u2019s appointment, a dentist appointment, a hospital appointment,\u201d Paul James McDermott, 69, told CNN at a small far-right demonstration in Sheffield on Wednesday. \u201cWe have become second-class citizens in our own country,\u201d he said, though migrants receive no benefits in accessing medical care, and asylum seekers are permitted only limited care.\nThe motives of the far-right stray well beyond concern about migration, and into hatred and racism. \u201cWe are losing our heritage to a Muslim situation that has got out of control. They want this country for their own,\u201d McDermott also said. Referring to a larger crowd of counter-protesters in Sheffield, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell\u2019s going on with them. They\u2019re not human.\u201d\nBut the explosion of anti-migrant discourse on Britain\u2019s airwaves and online, coupled with the breakdown of the country\u2019s underfunded public services, has given Brits tempted by far-right discourse a more emotive, and socially acceptable, entry point.\nThe combination of those grievances with the proliferation of far-right material is a trend that Britain is not facing alone, but it is a force Starmer has pledged to counter.\nStarmer styled himself as an antidote to populism at the start of his time in office, and told rioters in an address from Downing Street: \u201cI guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder.\u201d How quickly he comes through on those promises may become a defining question of his premiership.\nCNN\u2019s Christian Edwards contributed reporting", "41280": "title: UK riots: Inside the hidden Telegram messaging channels where the far-right organise \n content: Revealed: Inside the far-right Telegram messaging channels where UK rioters organise\nThe Russian-owned app has been criticised for a severe lack of moderation\nSupport truly\nindependent journalism\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\nLouise Thomas\nEditor\nFar-right riots across England have been fuelled by online disinformation ever since a group sprang up on a Russian-owned app to exploit a tragedy in which three children were killed.\nPolice are working to prevent more disorder, with over 400 people arrested and dozens of officers injured in cities all over the country.\nMore far-right action was planned for Wednesday, with immigration law firms targeted, but mobs failed to appear and instead tens of thousands of anti-racist counter-protesters took to the streets.\nThe first riot took place in Southport on 30 July in response to the deaths of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine. They were attending a dance class in the town the day before when they were killed in a multiple stabbing which left eight other children injured.\nAxel Rudakubana, who has been charged with their murders, was not initially named due to being 17 when he was arrested. This is when misinformation about the suspect became rife online, with many claiming that he was a Muslim and asylum seeker \u2013 both untrue.\nFollowing the killings, a broadcast channel on messaging app Telegram was set up, titled \u2018Southport Wake Up\u2019. It would remain open for nearly a week, amassing over 13,000 members.\nThe earliest messages in the channel were used to organise and mobilise the far-right rioters in Southport on 30 July who attacked a mosque. It remained open, sharing locations for rioters to mobilise over the weekend, with some of the plans resulting in widespread disorder and destruction of property.\nFounded in 2013 by Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov, Telegram is an instant messaging service that has a range of social media features. It allows users to set up \u2018channels\u2019 \u2013 large public groups which can broadcast messages to up to 200,000 people. Many of these can be searched for on the platform, others require a link.\nAfter more plans were shared for Wednesday, The Independent approached Telegram to ask if it planned to remove the channel. The following day, spokesperson Remi Vaughn said: \u201cThe channels publishing calls to violence have been removed.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cTelegram\u2019s terms of service explicitly forbid calls to violence. Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring of public parts of the platform and user reports in order to remove content that breaches our terms of service.\n\u201cEach day, millions of pieces of dangerous content are removed before they can cause harm.\u201d\nDespite this, dozens of large channels which routinely share far-right content on the app remain open. Many of these have continued to share details of plans for Wednesday.\nAt 9am that day, four separate channels reshared the full list of locations for far-right action. They had a collective membership of just under 200,000 users, with the message receiving a shared 13,000 views.\nIn a disclaimer to the message, the original poster cites \u201cfreedom of the press\u201d, adding: \u201cThis list does not constitute an endorsement of any protest action that may lead to violence.\u201d\nReplies to the message would suggest it was interpreted otherwise, with users sharing rioting tactics, discussing how to start a \u2018revolution,\u2019 and mocking police for preventing them from \u2018[stopping] children getting stabbed\u2019. In these comment sections and across all the channels, anti-Muslim rhetoric, racist memes and racial slurs are used casually.\n\u201cTelegram is the transnational far-right extremist platform of choice,\u201d says Professor Matthew Feldman, a specialist on right-wing extremism who teaches at the University of York.\n\u201cFascists, neo-nazis and the broader far-right have truly found a home there because they\u2019re not being deplatformed or removed. Their content is safe, secure and they can continue to, more or less, say what they like.\u201d\nProf Feldman points out that the app\u2019s moderation team is \u201cless than a dozen\u201d, compared to Facebook\u2019s tens of thousands of moderators.\nTelegram\u2019s privacy policy says it would provide information about anonymous posters to authorities if asked to do so, but claims it never has been. Telegram currently operates out of Dubai.\nWhen joining a far-right channel on the app, users are presented with a box making them aware of \u201csimilar channels\u201d. This makes it very easy for someone exposed to one source of far-right misinformation to quickly gain access to many more. Users are limited to seeing nine recommendations but can see an unlimited amount if they pay \u00a334.99 for a year of Telegram Premium.\nCross-posting between channels is common, allowing users to trace some messages back to their origins. Even if a message has been deleted or has disappeared from its source channel, it will remain live in channels to which it has been forwarded.\nSome of these are run by well-known individuals such as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, or former BNP leader Nick Griffin.\nBut most operate under pseudonyms, sharing conspiracy theories, fascist or nazi rhetoric, and racist content. It seems they operate with near-impunity on the platform as they share cherry-picked news stories to their large audience, often alongside quotes from figures like Adolf Hitler or Oswald Mosley, and Islamophobic misinformation.\nTelegram\u2019s approach to anonymity, privacy and verification makes the platform very attractive for far-right users. The app offers end-to-end encryption, making it near-impossible for anyone but the sender and the recipient to see messages. Regular users can decide their own screen name and change it regularly, without needing to prove their identity.\nProf Feldman, who has worked with the CPS on far-right terrorism, said: \u201cYou have to look really hard for fascist and neo-nazi extremists who are minded to engage in political violence and not on Telegram.\u201d\nHe says there is a network of far-right groups on the platform who go by the collective name \u2018Terrorgram.\u2019 The group was listed as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the government in April 2024.\nAlthough moderation is lacking on Telegram, this does not mean illegal activity is permitted on the app. Director of public prosecutions Stephen Parkinson has said he is \u201cabsolutely\u201d seeking to prosecute people for online offences related to the rioting.\nHe added: \u201cIf you\u2019re engaged in that activity, then you can be prosecuted for the substantive offence that you have caused [due] to what you\u2019ve been doing using the internet.\u201d\nOn 6 August, Jordan Parlour became the first person to be convicted of stirring up racial hatred online in connection to the riots. In that case the 28-year-old had made online comments advocating an attack on a hotel in Leeds.\nIt remains to be seen whether the government will call on Telegram to release information about users, which the company\u2019s policy indicates it would comply with.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe expect social media companies to take their responsibilities seriously and that includes countering the misleading and inflammatory material hosted on their platforms.\u201d\n\u201cPeople already being charged for illegal online activity should serve as a warning to anyone who intends to use any platform to incite hatred.\u201d\nOfcom has released an open letter to online service providers, requesting they take steps to prevent the spread of \u201charmful video material stemming from the recent events\u201d.\nGroup director for online safety Gill Whitehead said: \u201cWe expect continued engagement with companies over this period to understand the specific issues they face, and we welcome the proactive approaches that have been deployed by some services in relation to these acts of violence across the UK.\u201d\nUnder the Online Safety Act, passed last year, the telecoms watchdog will be given greater powers to enforce the systematic removal of illegal content from social media platforms operating in the UK. Ofcom says this will happen by the end of the year, while experts including Prof Feldman predict that early 2026 is more realistic.\nTelegram has been approached for comment regarding all the channels mentioned and its approach to moderation on the app.", "41425": "title: Thousands of police braced for day of riots as Elon Musk fans flames with tirade against Starmer \n content: Thousands of police braced for day of riots as Elon Musk fans flames with tirade against Starmer\nX owner Elon Musk has launched a tirade against Keir Starmer on his social media platform reposting far-right messages as 6,000 police prepare for more unrest across the country\nSupport truly\nindependent journalism\nOur mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\nLouise Thomas\nEditor\nBillionaire social media platform owner Elon Musk has launched a tirade against Sir Keir Starmer amid fears that Britain is on the cusp of descending further into civil unrest.\nIt came as a standing army of 6,000 police officers was preparing for a new wave of violence at 39 demonstrations planned around the UK.\nThere was fury that Mr Musk used far-right messages and images to attack Sir Keir personally as he appeared to fan the flames of discontent. But when questioned on the X owner\u2019s comments, he repeatedly refused to even acknowledge Mr Musk by name.\nThe apparently unprovoked attack on Starmer and the UK government from across the Atlantic came as:\n- Two emergency meetings were called by Sir Keir, first with his cabinet and then the emergency committee Cobra to prepare for more violence\n- Fears offices of legal firms that help asylum seekers and asylum centres will be targeted in 39 protests planned for Wednesday\n- A warning the violence is set to spread to new parts of the country, with concerns flagged up by Scottish secretary Ian Murray\n- Residents and businesses board up homes and offices in target areas\n- 1,000 writers, actors and musicians call for an end to racism, condemning violence\n- The address of an 88-year-old grandmother was wrongly included on a far-right target list\n- Security advice has been handed out to MPs over fears they could be targeted\nWith Britain braced for further violence, there were also calls for a travel ban to be imposed on Mr Musk over fears that his tirade of tweets being posted on his own social media website could fan the flames of riots.\nMr Musk, who has 193 million followers on X and is donating millions to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, suggested on Monday that \u201ccivil war is inevitable\u201d in the UK \u2013 comments which were criticised by Downing Street.\nBut this was as nothing to the plethora of tweets he put out on Tuesday as he also claimed that his site X is \u201cthe UK\u2019s biggest source of news\u201d at a time when his own messages appeared to repeat fake claims.\nIt was quite a turnaround from a man for whom former prime minister Rishi Sunak rolled out the red carpet last November ahead of an artificial intelligence conference.\nMost damaging was his tweet with the hashtag #twotierkeir \u2013 a far-right claim which has been used to justify the riots, suggesting police are going soft on left-wing and Islamic protesters but hard on far-right white working-class protesters. He appeared to repeat conspiracy theories which critics claim are also being pushed by another friend of Mr Trump, Nigel Farage.\nThe allegation is police are afraid of being branded racist so will not tackle violent Muslim demonstrators, including those making antisemitic chants. Ironically, the \u201ctwo-tier\u201d claim from Mr Musk came just as a lawyer for a Muslim man who was kicked in the head at Manchester airport alleged the police were racist.\nMr Musk also posted an image of the lead character from the adult cartoon Family Guy in an electric chair with the message: \u201cIn 2030 for making a Facebook comment that the UK government didn\u2019t like.\u201d\nOther posts included an image comparing the treatment of three alleged rapists which suggested the Muslim man had avoided jail, but it turned out that the man identified was not guilty of the crime claimed.\nAnother tweet from Mr Musk showed footage of an armed Muslim gang of men in Birmingham with the message: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t all communities protected in Britain? @Keir_Starmer.\u201d\nMr Sunak has made no comment about the man he lauded who is now trolling Britain on social media.\nSir Keir also ignored Mr Musk and repeatedly refused to be drawn on the issue when speaking to the BBC after his emergency Cobra meeting.\nHe said: \u201cMy focus is on ensuring that our communities are safe. That is my sole focus and I think it\u2019s very important for us all to support the police in what they\u2019re doing.\n\u201cI went up to Southport to speak to some of the police who had been the first responders to the terrible attack that happened. They described the scene to me and what they had to deal with when those girls were attacked.\n\u201cThose same officers were then attacked on their own streets later the same day \u2013 the same officers who had been the first responders.\n\u201cOur first duty is to support the police in a difficult exercise that they are engaged in, keeping us safe... the police are doing a difficult job in difficult circumstances and I think that everybody should be giving their full support to ensure that we can make sure that our streets are safe and our communities feel safe and secure.\n\u201cThat is really where the focus ought to be. That is my sole focus and that\u2019s why I held this second Cobra meeting.\u201d\nBut justice minister Heidi Alexander said: \u201cWe have got police officers being seriously injured on our streets. People are looting buildings. They\u2019re setting buildings alight, and for someone who has a big platform, a large following, to be exercising that power in such an irresponsible way, I think is actually pretty unconscionable.\u201d\nMeanwhile, commentator Nels Abbey, author of Think Like a White Man, demanded a UK travel ban on Mr Musk.\nHe said: \u201cBritain banned Snoop Dogg, Chris Brown, Ja Rule and Michael Savage for a lot less than inciting race riots and winking towards a civil war in our country. Keir Starmer should ban Elon Musk from entering the UK and using our airspace.\u201d\nThe two Labour MPs competing for the chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee \u2013 Chi Onwurah and Dawn Butler \u2013 have both told Politico that they will demand Mr Musk appears before them to answer for his behaviour.\nSir Keir\u2019s \u201cstanding army\u201d of almost 6,000 specialist riot officers is braced for further unrest after a list shared online singled out immigration lawyers, charities and support services for mass action on Wednesday evening.\nOne immigration advice centre is boarding up its windows over fears of clashes as the Law Society, representing solicitors in England and Wales, said it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the safety of its members.\nThey called for the prime minister to treat threats against the legal profession with the \u201cutmost seriousness\u201d as one immigration lawyer revealed he had received a death threat.\nAt least 19 counterprotests are planned to defend immigration services being targeted on the list, which was widely shared in far-right groups on Telegram.\nAnti-fascist campaign group Hope not Hate described the roll of targets, circulated by an anonymous organiser also linked to riots in Southport and Liverpool, as a \u201chit list\u201d and urged everyone named to be on high alert.\nAt an emergency cabinet meeting, Sir Keir updated his senior ministers. Afterwards, he said: \u201cWhen I went to Southport, I spoke to police who described what it was like to attend the mass stabbing of little girls and then to be back on duty the next day in riot gear, having bricks thrown at them.\n\u201cThis is something no one would have ever wanted to see and we need to be calling it out for what it is. It is not protest. It is violent disorder and needs to be treated as such, as criminal activity.\n\u201cNinety-nine point nine per cent of people across the country want their streets to be safe and to feel safe in their communities, and we will take all necessary action to bring the disorder to an end.\u201d\nThe prime minister then held an evening session of the emergency Cobra committee meeting with his deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, home secretary Yvette Cooper, senior government officials and police chiefs to ensure the authorities are prepared for a new wave of violence.\nScottish secretary Ian Murray also put out a warning that the unrest could spread to Scotland. He said: \u201cI've spoken to the chief constable of Police Scotland today and made clear to her that she and her officers have my full support. I am reassured that they do not have any specific intelligence that disorder is likely in Scotland at this point, but we must not be complacent.\u201d\nSo far, courts have not been asked to stay open 24/7 but the measure is possible if the number of cases involving rioters continues to balloon.", "41666": "title: There can be no excuses. The UK riots were violent racism fomented by populism \n content: Perhaps unhelpfully, we use the term \u201crace riot\u201d to describe two very different phenomena, each with its own dismal history. In the 1980s, it was the term attached to the uprisings that erupted among Black communities in Liverpool, Bristol, Leeds, London and elsewhere. Outbreaks of lawlessness and violence that were in large part a response to racial targeting by the police: harassment that aggravated existing disadvantages and intensified deep disillusionment, especially among the younger generation who had been born in Britain.\nHowever, a very different set of events with a far longer history has also been defined as race riots. The deadly disturbances of 1919 in Liverpool, Cardiff, Glasgow, London, Salford, Newport, Barry, Hull and South Shields, like the riots that came again to Liverpool in 1948, and those that broke out in 1958 in Nottingham and London\u2019s Notting Hill.\nIn each of the latter cases, the rioters were mobs of white men. The grievance that brought them on to the streets was the presence in their cities of non-white people. We must now add the summer of 2024 to the list of riots that were in essence organised violence against minority communities. My generation, brought up amid the endemic racism of the 1980s, had in recent years started to believe that our memories of being assaulted on the streets or besieged in our homes belonged firmly to a 20th-century Britain that we had long ago left behind. Now members of another generation of Britons from minority communities have traumatic memories that they too will have to process later in life.\nAn understanding of the long and ugly history of the second type of British \u201crace riot\u201d might have helped some of the journalists and commentators who last week attempted to explain the causes of the wave of violence and looting we have just witnessed. The initial category error, made by much of the media, was to describe riots as protests. That misstep led to later difficulties. It convinced editors of the need to adopt the increasingly unviable stance of \u201cbothsidesism\u201d and to go in search of deeper social causes behind the violence. Race riots of the sort Britain experienced in 1919, 1948 and 1958 have always had the same motivations \u2013 racism and nativism.\nAs brave reportage gave way to fumbling analysis, one fundamental reality was repeatedly overlooked. While there were horrific attacks on hotels housing asylum seekers, most of those targeted by the rioters were British citizens: members of communities with histories that go back three generations or more. When the mobs in Rotherham launched their sickening assault on a hotel, the racial slur spray-painted on to that hotel\u2019s walls was the P-word, aimed not at asylum seekers but squarely at the established British Muslim community.\nRiots are not protests and there is a difference between motivations and excuses. Despite much that has been said, the riots of 2024 were not born of \u201clegitimate grievances\u201d about poverty, underinvestment and the breakdown of basic services, all supposedly deepened by mass immigration. The people attacked on the streets, those who had to defend their places of worship or their homes, are the neighbours of the rioters. They live in the same towns and suffer the consequences of the exact same poverty and underinvestment.\nThose who live in Britain\u2019s long list of neglected towns \u2013 such as Gateshead, where I grew up, which ranks as the 47th poorest of England\u2019s 317 local authorities \u2013 have no shortage of entirely legitimate grievances. But that is true irrespective of their race or religion. The Britain of 2024 is by some measures the most unequal society in Europe. Real wages have not increased since 2008 and the lowest-income British households are 20% poorer than the lowest-income families in France. But those bleak realities are the result of long-term political choices, not asylum seekers huddled terrified in hotels.\nThe ideological fanaticism of the Thatcher government that limited the ability of local authorities to use income generated from the sale of council houses to build new properties, the ideologically driven impoverishment of local government by the Cameron-Osborne government and the self-inflicted wound of Brexit: these and other factors are what lie behind the shocking lack of access to basic resources \u2013 social housing, doctor\u2019s appointments and dental surgeries. Immigration, rather than worsening that situation, is one of the few levers we have to increase access to medical care. Skilled immigration will also be needed if we are to build the millions of homes needed.\nTo put the violence directed at British Muslims, Black Britons and asylum seeking down to \u201clegitimate grievances\u201d is to fall for one of the most toxic and intentionally divisive falsehoods in the populist handbook: the myth that class and race are diametrically opposed, the assertion that non-white people have no class identity. In this distorted world view, the true working class are the \u201cwhite working class\u201d, and the difficulties they face are not a consequences of political choices that affect everyone, irrespective of ethnicity, skin colour or faith, but of \u201celites\u201d putting the needs of minority communities first. As if those minorities are not themselves working class. Boris Johnson\u2019s disastrous government pushed that falsehood whenever it got the chance.\nHowever, a defining characteristic of the populist right \u2013 both politicians and their enablers at the tabloids and online \u2013 is an absolute, ironclad, unwavering refusal to take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions. They scuttled away from the wreckage of Brexit \u2013 always built on an economic fairytale \u2013 pointing accusatory fingers at others as their most cherished political project decimated Britain\u2019s trade, shrank the economy and trashed our international reputation \u2013 as had been both predicted and forewarned. Now, eight years later, they are equally determined to sidestep responsibility for the long-term consequences of their short-term electoral strategies.\nA nation that was led for three years by a prime minister who used ethnic and racial slurs against Muslim women and African children, in which newspaper columnists were allowed to describe asylum seekers as \u201cvermin\u201d and in which those same papers constantly and deliberately conflated the separate issues of immigration and asylum: such a nation, sooner or later, was always going to face consequences.\nJust as with Brexit, the consequences of populism and culture wars were both foreseen and forewarned. Among the Cassandras whose prophecies went unheeded was the Conservative party\u2019s former co-chairwoman Baroness Sayeeda Warsi. Three years ago she warned that \u201cdog whistles win votes but destroy nations\u201d. Last week, Warsi was even more robust in her criticism of former colleagues. As was the former counter-extremism tsar Dame Sara Khan. They and others have denounced the ways in which the last government poisoned political debate and normalised Islamophobia, while at the same time dismissing warnings of the growing dangers of far-right extremism.\nWhile the rioters and those willing to assign coherent political meanings to their criminality have spoken loudly, others have fallen deathly silent. As figures like Warsi took to the TV and podcast studios the politicians who are normally most vocal when there are divisions to be fomented and culture wars to be fought went awol. Kemi Badenoch\u2019s retreat from the airwaves was so complete that even other Tories dubbed her disappearing act a \u201csubmarine\u201d strategy.\nThe profound injustices and stark regional disparities that have been wrongly ascribed as the motivations of the rioters urgently and obviously need to be addressed. But that reality has nothing directly to do with the actions of people who burned down a library and an advice centre, looted booze from a smashed-up Sainsbury\u2019s and hurled rocks at Filipino nurses on their way to their shifts in NHS hospitals.\nFar-right groups, organising online, increasingly inspired by and connected to similar groups in the US and Europe, are not motivated by such concerns. They are, however, always eager to exploit them. The far-right already have an agenda; they always have. Disconnected from reason, it changes little over time. Behind the curtain of the dark web, in their grim chatrooms and Telegram forums, their true motivations are on display. They are not looking to address inequalities but to target those whom they will never accept as fellow Britons.\nIn doing so, they, and those swept up in the chaos they foment, are willing to tear apart the nation to which they preposterously claim to be patriots.\nDavid Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We are seeing police officers being seriously injured, buildings set alight, and so I really do think that everyone who has a platform should be exercising their power responsibly.\u201d\nSix people charged in Rotherham after hotel set fire\nSix people have been charged with offences following rioting outside a hotel in Rotherham on Sunday, South Yorkshire Police said.\nLee Crisp, 42, of Mount Road, Grimethorpe, Christopher Rodgers, 38, of Millmoor Road, Barnsley, and Liam Grey, 20, of Randerson Drive, Mexborough, have been charged with violent disorder.\nTwo boys aged 16 and 17, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have also been charged with violent disorder.\nJoshua Simpson, 26, of Sherbrook Street, Lincoln, has been charged with violent disorder and assault of an emergency worker.\nThe force said all six are due to appear at Sheffield Magistrates\u2019 Court on Tuesday morning.\nAll being violent will face consequences \u2018no matter who they are\u2019 after pub attacked in Birmingham\nSafeguarding minister Jess Phillips said perpetrators of violence in Birmingham \u201cwill face the consequences no matter who they are\u201d.\nThe Home Office minister, who is the MP for Birmingham Yardley, tweeted: \u201cThe police have attended all sites of violence tonight and all those perpetrating it will face the consequences no matter who they are.\n\u201cThanks to all residents who have acted with grace and kindness and have kept people informed so actions could be taken.\u201d\nMs Phillips had reposted text from Birmingham Police\u2019s account, which read: \u201cWe have been working hard alongside our community leaders and would like to thank everyone for their support today.\u201d\nThe MP had earlier written: \u201cPeople in Yardley are scared tonight. We have directed police to all locations of violence we are hearing about. Any acts of violence will not be tolerated.\u201d\nSix arrested in Plymouth\nSix people were arrested following disorder in Plymouth on Monday evening, and several officers suffered minor injuries in the violence, Devon and Cornwall Police said.\nThe force said specialist officers were deployed to the Guildhall in the city centre at around 3.30pm, and a number of members of the public were injured, with two taken to hospital.\n\u201cOur approach to this operation was to enable peaceful protests, but people who were intent on committing public order or criminal offences, have and will be dealt with robustly. This is the style of policing that we have delivered and what our communities expect,\u201d the force said.\n\u201cViolence will not be tolerated, hate will not be tolerated, and we will continue to work with our partners to keep the people of Devon, Cornwall, and the Isles of Scilly safe and reduce anti-social behaviour.\n\u201cWe will continue to take positive action against individuals in breach of the law and have carried out arrests for a range of public order offences and assaults following today\u2019s events.\n\u201cWe will also be following up on post investigative enquiries throughout the coming days.\u201d\nRioters \u2018defile the flag they wrap themselves in\u2019, Archbishop says\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury has said far-right rioters \u201cdefile the flag they wrap themselves in\u201d as violence continues across the UK.\nHorrifying scenes across the UK in the last week have seen rioters take to the streets, setting fires and looting with many wearing England or British flags.\nArchbishop Justin Welby told BBC Radio 4: \u201cIt is not British. It is not English. They defile the flag they wrap themselves in.\u201d\n18-year-old arrested after bricks thrown at police in Darlington\nOne person has been arrested after bricks were thrown at police during violent disorder in Darlington on Monday evening, according to Durham Police.\nThe force said dozens of police officers were deployed to the North Lodge Park area after two large groups of men gathered shortly after 9pm.\nIt said this resulted in \u201csmall pockets of serious violence, which saw bricks being thrown at police officers who attended the scene\u201d.\nAn 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder, assaulting a police officer and possession of a controlled drug, a spokesman said.\nHe remains in custody on Tuesday morning.\n500 additional prison places put into use\nHeidi Alexander said the Government had brought more than 500 additional prison places into use to deal with rioting, and some 6,000 specialist police officers were at the ready.\nThe justice minister told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe will make sure that anyone who is given a custodial sentence as a result of the riots and disorder, there will be a prison place waiting for them.\n\u201cWhat we have been able to do in the last week since the problems have arisen is that we have been able to bring forward some additional prison places that we had been due to bring on stream later in the month. There are 567 additional prison places.\u201d\nAsked whether there were enough lawyers to deal with the amount of prosecutions coming forward, and the possibility courts could sit through the night, the justice minister told Times Radio: \u201cI think we will make it work, because these are extraordinary circumstances and we need to be delivering swift justice.\u201d\nShe also revealed more detail about the planned \u201cstanding army\u201d of police officers, telling Times Radio: \u201cThese are police officers who have had specialist training in dealing with public order offences.\n\u201cWe had 4,000 available at the weekend. There will be another 2,000 available this week. It also means that police officers are able to be deployed in parts of the country where they are needed most.\u201d\n\u2018Petrol bombs thrown\u2019 as riot police attempt to quell violence in Belfast\nRiot police were attacked with missiles and fires were lit in the streets again on Monday night as violence once again flared up in the Donegall Road area of south Belfast.\nA smaller protest had taken place on Monday evening in Belfast city centre, but the latest violence began several hours later in the same area where two businesses were attacked on Saturday.\nOfficers in riot gear sealed off the street as social media footage showed police officers warning the crowd to disperse.\nReports said around 100 people had gathered in the Donegall Road area, with petrol bombs being thrown.\nDarlington disorder\nAn 18-year-old man was arrested following violent disorder in Darlington on Monday.\nDozens of police officers were deployed to the North Lodge Park area after two large groups of mostly males gathered just after 9pm.\nPolice said \u201csmall pockets of serious violence\u201d included bricks being thrown at officers.\nAssistant Chief Constable Richie Allen said: \u201cWhat we have been dealing with tonight in Darlington has been sporadic pockets of violent disorder involving groups of people intent on causing serious harm to our communities and their property.\n\u201cWe deployed a number of officers to the scene who worked throughout the night to disperse those involved.\u201d", "43668": "title: British Govt shows the world how to deal with rioters \n content: Opinion / Columnist\nBritish Govt shows the world how to deal with rioters\n9 hrs ago | Views\nIt's, unfortunately, depressingly familiar. Violence has broken out in the United Kingdom led by loosely organised thugs driven by fake news and hate speech on social media that was made acceptable by legal, if unpleasant political speech, designed to create division rather than inspire debate on disagreements within a united nation.\nZimbabweans know exactly how such violence occurs, having suffered it, and also have developed ways of preventing this violence, without damaging the underlying democracy we enjoy, although many, including a lot now on the receiving end in Britain, have been critical of the quite legal means we have used.\nZimbabwe has never experienced violence of that magnitude.\nBritish government shows the world how to deal with rioters\nThe British Government, police and judiciary have in the past week followed an almost identical route that Zimbabwe followed: mobilising and deploying riot police, arresting those involved and seeking those who ran away, doing the hard-graft detective work to hunt down the inciters, ensuring that violence trials jump the court queues, and with judicial officers feeling quite rightly that bail is not really an option in these cases.\nThe only real difference with the Zimbabwean situations has been the attitude of outsiders, condemning Zimbabwean authorities for doing what the British Government is now firmly doing.\nThe British xenophobic attacks are over quite different grounds from the Zimbabwean outbreaks of violence that were brought under control legally, but the basic conditions are the same: A small thuggish minority, who assume they have wider backing because of how people vote, incitement from figures who do their level best to stand aside from the results they have created directly and indirectly, fake news, and the whole mess dumped in the lap of the police, the Government and the judicial authorities.\nThe violence in Britain was triggered by the brutal murder last week of three little girls in a small town near Liverpool.\nThe killer was of immigrant descent, Christian immigrant descent, and a British citizen raised in the country. He was arrested and will face trial for murder and almost certainly be convicted.\nBut those wanting to use this tragedy for division circulated on social media fake reports, starting with a name change to a Muslim name and false claims that he was a refugee who entered Britain illegally.\nThese were used to drum up support for protests that were nothing more than assembled thugs determined on violence against British Muslims and the refugees in that country.\nThe thugs were joined by others who wanted to take advantage of the disorder to loot shops owned by British Muslims. Dozens of police battling to protect the people have been injured, some very seriously with broken bones.\nMost Zimbabweans will remember a dreadful tragedy here, when a Chitungwiza security guard was brutally murdered and her body hacked up by a former boyfriend, and people using social media to spread lies that her kidnapping and murder were politically organised. Those lies sparked violence and looting in Nyatsime.\nIn the UK, 428 men have so far been arrested, and the courts are not messing around with bail. Those arrested for violence and incitement are remanded in custody when they are brought to court.\nThose faced with overwhelming evidence and pleading guilty have a very early trial, jumping the backlog queue, and already the first jail terms are being dished out, with the most severe for three years. The Government accelerated the commissioning of 500 new prison places so there was space.\nOf course some, and especially those arrested for incitement or passing along false reports, if the Zimbabwean experience is anything to go by, will not plead guilty and then will have lawyers who will use every legal method to delay trial and try and create sympathy.\nDetective work is being done to bring in those who incited the rioting, usually on social media, and already there is one conviction for this, with the man in custody until sentencing in a couple of weeks.\nOther detectives are going through video of the riots to identify those involved, but still at large, and are using modern technologies to help in this, and they have been warned that they can expect to be arrested.\nSevere comment has appeared in Britain over the sea of Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment created by one party, Reform UK, which achieved the third highest percentage vote in the recent elections with 14,3 percent, although very spread out so resulting in only five MPs, and that backed by the wilder elements of the Tory party. They deny responsibility, but were working on division.\nThe comments centre that although these legal political entities did not pass the fake news or incite the violence, they helped create the conditions and played a part in damaging the otherwise remarkable community relations in modern Britain.\nCalls are now being made for far better regulation of social media, so at least those who create the lies and circulate lies will face the courts on the same charges as they would if they shouted the same lies in the streets or printed them in a newspaper. Social media is still media.\nThe British riots highlight what happens when politicians try and create division rather than underlying unity. We distinguish between division and the normal and sometimes very robust disagreement and debate on policies found in a functioning democracy. Using religion, background, origin and similar attributes to create that division is evil, since it does not involve democratic disagreement.\nThis creation of such division can then make acceptable views and attitudes that can be exploited by those who want to see a breakdown of society, and make obvious lies and falsehoods believed by some.\nWe agree that social media platforms need to be made accountable if they allow lies and hate-speech to circulate. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to lie and incite hatred, and never has.\nThe rules developed over centuries to mark the boundaries for public speeches and within the print media must be applied to social media as well. We welcome the British Government's decision to deal firmly with merchants of violence out to cause anarchy and disorder.\nHowever, we cannot help, but point out the naked duplicity and double standards applied when it comes to Zimbabwe which is often faced with such outbreaks of violence spawned by opposition elements and activists.\nIt is ironic that the British Government and its American cousins are usually at the forefront of demonising Zimbabwe for seeking to maintain law and order.\nZimbabweans know exactly how such violence occurs, having suffered it, and also have developed ways of preventing this violence, without damaging the underlying democracy we enjoy, although many, including a lot now on the receiving end in Britain, have been critical of the quite legal means we have used.\nZimbabwe has never experienced violence of that magnitude.\nBritish government shows the world how to deal with rioters\nThe British Government, police and judiciary have in the past week followed an almost identical route that Zimbabwe followed: mobilising and deploying riot police, arresting those involved and seeking those who ran away, doing the hard-graft detective work to hunt down the inciters, ensuring that violence trials jump the court queues, and with judicial officers feeling quite rightly that bail is not really an option in these cases.\nThe only real difference with the Zimbabwean situations has been the attitude of outsiders, condemning Zimbabwean authorities for doing what the British Government is now firmly doing.\nThe British xenophobic attacks are over quite different grounds from the Zimbabwean outbreaks of violence that were brought under control legally, but the basic conditions are the same: A small thuggish minority, who assume they have wider backing because of how people vote, incitement from figures who do their level best to stand aside from the results they have created directly and indirectly, fake news, and the whole mess dumped in the lap of the police, the Government and the judicial authorities.\nThe violence in Britain was triggered by the brutal murder last week of three little girls in a small town near Liverpool.\nThe killer was of immigrant descent, Christian immigrant descent, and a British citizen raised in the country.
