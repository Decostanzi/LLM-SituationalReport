    "summary": "The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) are working together to enhance disaster risk reduction and humanitarian assistance across the ASEAN region. This collaboration has led to the launch and continuous enhancement of the Disaster Monitoring and Response System (DMRS), which provides near-real-time impact analysis, advanced analytics, insights, and actionable information for a multitude of hazards, serving all ASEAN Member States[1][11][31]. The DMRS, powered by PDC's DisasterAWARE technology, was launched in 2012 as a joint effort between PDC and the AHA Centre[31][32]. Located in Jakarta, Indonesia, the AHA Centre is tasked with coordinating disaster management among ASEAN Member States and offers early warning and impact analysis through DMRS, along with training and capacity development[2][12][31][32].\n\nIn addition to these technological advancements, PDC and the AHA Centre have collaborated on disaster risk assessments and exercise engagements, including ARDEX, ADMM-Plus, and national-level exercises, to further strengthen the region's disaster preparedness[2][12]. The DMRS empowers decision-makers by providing them with the necessary tools to understand risks and quickly mobilize life-saving humanitarian resources[31].\n\nMeanwhile, the agricultural sector faces challenges due to extreme weather conditions. Torrential rain and prolonged drought have severely impacted pepper farming, leading to dying plants, no harvest, and lower quality produce[21]. Earlier in the season, torrential rain destroyed the plants' flowers, and the subsequent drought caused more plants to die due to the lack of water[21]. Farmers reported extreme heat and no rain, resulting in no water for the pepper plants, with one farmer expecting no harvest this year compared to nine tonnes last year[21][22]. Another farmer noted that the little that could be harvested was of lower quality, predicting a scarcity of pepper for 2024 and 2025[23]. However, the sources do not specify that these agricultural impacts occurred in Indonesia.",

One such initiative involves training a team of residents in each village surrounding the volcano to assist with potential evacuations[1]. In parallel, the government is addressing the rebuilding of infrastructure in West Sumatra, with President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo urging authorities to expedite the reconstruction of damaged public infrastructure[12]. While most roads and temporary bridges have been rebuilt, some remain under construction[11]. Efforts to clear debris and repair infrastructure are ongoing, with heavy equipment being utilized to clean up disaster areas[11][13]. For example, on May 17, 2024, an excavator was employed to construct a temporary bridge over a river in Nagari Sungai Bambu, Tanah Datar regency, facilitating the delivery of aid to flood victims[12].\n\nIn addition to these efforts, the BNPB is employing weather modification technology, commonly known as cloud seeding, to manage rainfall intensity in disaster-struck areas[31]. This technology is used to aid rescue efforts by making clouds release rain earlier, thereby reducing the rainfall's intensity when it reaches the affected areas[31]. Specifically, the BNPB has been attempting to redirect rain away from rivers on the slopes of the volcano, in response to forecasts of moderate to heavy precipitation by the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG)[21][26][32]. This strategic use of cloud seeding aims to mitigate the impact of heavy rainfall on vulnerable regions[24].",
