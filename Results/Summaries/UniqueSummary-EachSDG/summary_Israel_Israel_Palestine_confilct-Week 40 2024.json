    "summary": "The ongoing conflict in Gaza has resulted in extensive civilian harm, with explosive weapons causing significant damage in densely populated areas and leading to forced displacement orders. This situation necessitates urgent action to protect civilians from escalating violence and ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid[1]. Israeli airstrikes have recently targeted at least six UN-run schools sheltering displaced Palestinians, raising concerns about the repeated attacks on shelters for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the Strip[11][14]. In the past 72 hours alone, these strikes have resulted in tens of fatalities, including children and women[14][17].\n\nSpecific incidents include Israeli airstrikes on a mosque and the Ibn Rushd School in Al-Zawaida, both sheltering displaced civilians in central Gaza, which killed at least 24 Palestinians, including children, and injured 93 others[12][13]. The displaced Palestinian population faces the grim reality of being ordered from one area to another, only to be bombed in the schools and tents where they seek refuge[15]. The dire conditions in Gaza are exacerbated by poor water, sanitation, and hygiene, along with overcrowding in shelters, which are primary drivers of disease outbreaks[26]. The lack of clean water and hygiene products has led to outbreaks of diarrhea and skin diseases[21], while the breakdown of sanitation infrastructure has resulted in a proliferation of disease vectors[22]. The collapse of waste management systems, including hazardous medical waste, contributes to contamination[25], and the inability to maintain hygiene severely impacts health, increasing the risk of epidemics[27][25].\n\nIsraeli airstrikes have severely impacted safety and living conditions in Gaza, with over 370,000 housing units damaged and 79,000 homes completely destroyed[32]. Approximately 68% of cropland and roads have also been severely damaged, leading to overcrowding and appalling sanitary conditions[32][37]. Food scarcity and the lack of clean water and hygiene products continue to cause outbreaks of diarrhea and skin diseases[31]. As of September 2024, only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, suffering from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water due to constant Israeli attacks[32].\n\nThe conflict has also severely impacted maternity care in Gaza, contributing to a rise in miscarriages, obstetric complications, low birth weight, and premature births, primarily due to stress, malnutrition, and a near-total lack of maternity care[41]. Ala'a, a pregnant woman, was forced to leave her home and live in a tent at seven months pregnant. She delivered her baby, Mohammad, in a field hospital in Khan Younis, which featured a specialized maternity unit supported by UK-Med and the UN agency for sexual and reproductive health, UNFPA[50][47]. Despite the ongoing war and lack of resources, Ala'a and her newborn recovered well, expressing gratitude to the hospital staff[47][50]. However, continuous support for health services is impossible without a ceasefire, full access, and sustained funding[48].\n\nThe conflict has profoundly impacted individuals like Taleen Al-Hinnawi and Nada Al-Gharib. Taleen lost her father and is adjusting to life in the Al-Baraka orphanage camp, where she finds a sense of community despite the shock and sadness[51]. Nada lost her father and brother and was injured in a strike on their tent in Khan Younis. Despite the hardships, she remains resilient, stating, \"We love our lives. Even though it's hard and the loss of our loved ones is hard for us, we try to live for them\"[58].\n\nThe Israeli military's Operation Iron Swords included a complete blockade of the Gaza Strip, resulting in a death toll exceeding 41,800 since October 7, according to the enclave's health ministry[91]. Thousands are reported missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings[96]. Heavy Israeli strikes have been reported across northern Gaza, with first responders unable to reach several hit homes and buildings due to bombardment[96]. The Israeli army has issued evacuation orders, leading people to leave their homes without knowing where to go or having means of transportation[91]. Strikes have targeted shelters, including a mosque and a school, killing people who were sheltering there[91]. Children are suffering, and hunger is spreading due to almost no basic supplies being available[98].\n\nThe conflict has raised deep concerns about mental health in Gaza, with over 485,000 people diagnosed with mental disorders before the war[102]. Humanitarian organizations are addressing these issues by running psychosocial support sessions for over 94,000 children and offering mental health services[107][102]. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls for a de-escalation of the conflict, advocating for healthcare to be protected, access routes to be secured, and supplies to be delivered. WHO also calls for a ceasefire, a political solution, and peace, with Tedros stating that \"The best medicine is peace\"[111].\n\nIsraeli military operations in Gaza have resulted in significant impacts on the civilian population, including fatalities, injuries, and displacement. More than 41,500 people have been killed, with children killed en masse[131][136]. There have also been 765 deaths resulting from at least 516 attacks on healthcare in Gaza since October 2023[131]. Over 96,000 people have been wounded, and at least 12,000 people are in desperate need of medical evacuation[135]. The civilian population has been repeatedly displaced and forced into smaller and smaller areas under bombardments, living in overcrowded and inhumane conditions[133][140].\n\nMilitary operations in the West Bank have caused significant damage to civilian infrastructure, including the forced demolition of over 2,000 Palestinian homes and massive damage to public infrastructure, such as roads[151]. These operations contribute to extreme mental distress and increased mental health concerns among the West Bank population[152].\n\nWomen in Gaza face a double burden, becoming heads of their households amidst destruction and navigating survival and care[161]. Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers have experienced immense difficulties due to the collapse in healthcare services[161]. Children in Gaza are experiencing profound trauma, grappling with anxiety and severe physical injuries, with many having lost limbs[164][166]. They have missed an entire year of education, and schools sheltering displaced families have been repeatedly shelled[163]. Over five times more children were killed in Gaza in the last year than between 2005 and 2022 combined[169]. Approximately 17,000 children are unaccompanied or separated, and 625,000 children have been out of school for a whole year[163].\n\nHumanitarian organizations are addressing these challenges in several ways. Oxfam partner Juzoor is supporting hundreds of thousands of people in over 90 shelters and health points across Gaza[161]. UNICEF has vaccinated thousands of children for polio in the area[161]. Oxfam is calling for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages and unlawfully detained Palestinians, and an end to all lethal arms sales to Israel[166]. They also demand full humanitarian access to Gaza and urge the international community to enforce accountability by addressing the illegal Israeli occupation, removing settlements in the occupied West Bank, and providing reparations to affected Palestinian communities[166].\n\nSignatory organizations consider the ongoing dehumanization of Lebanese civilians distressing, urging governments to impose sanctions, such as an arms embargo on Israel, for its gross violations of international law[171]. At least 885 healthcare workers have been killed, and women have had caesarians and children amputations without anesthetics[172].",

The overcrowded living conditions in temporary shelters, combined with limited access to clean water, sanitation facilities and hygiene products, have resulted in rapid spread of skin and other infectious diseases.Pollutants released from destroyed infrastructure, including potentially toxic substances from damaged industrial facilities, can have lasting impacts on human health. Children, in particular, are vulnerable to the effects of environmental toxins, which can impair cognitive development and lead to chronic health issues.The environmental crisis also has significant social and economic implications. The degradation of natural resources can exacerbate poverty and social inequality, as communities lose access to traditional livelihoods based on agriculture and fishing.",

      "22": "Polluted water used for irrigation can introduce harmful substances into the food chain, potentially causing long-term health issues for the population.The environmental crisis in Gaza is closely linked to a growing public health emergency. The lack of proper burial facilities for the high number of casualties has led to unconventional and often unsanitary disposal of human remains. Bodies left exposed in the rubble, or hastily buried in mass graves, pose significant health risks. The decomposition process releases bacteria and other pathogens which contaminate soil, groundwater, food, and water resources.The breakdown of sanitation infrastructure has resulted in a proliferation of disease vectors.",

He added that one of Muhammad's brothers-in-law was also in the apartment at the time and was killed.The Israeli military said the strike killed several militants, including Hamas' leader in the camp, who it accused of planning and taking part in multiple attacks against Israeli civilians. \"\"Look around, the destruction is so obvious,\" he said, adding that it was difficult to identify the bodies of his loved ones.The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on civilian deaths in the strike.",

People have been repeatedly displaced and forced into smaller and smaller areas under bombardments and increasingly inhumane conditions.For a year, Israel, Hamas, and their respective allies have catastrophically failed to reach a deal on a sustained ceasefire in Gaza, while the risk of a full-blown regional conflict is now increasing. Israel must immediately stop the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Gaza and urgently facilitate the delivery of aid to alleviate suffering inside the Strip, including through the reopening of vital border crossings, in compliance with the measures requested by the International Court of Justice.Mdecins Sans Frontires' MSF medical staff have treated patients on a daily basis with wounds caused by massive bombings.

These effects compound over time, and at some point, may result in startling increases in the death rate.The internationally recognised human right to food, water, and sanitation is a basic right that protects population health and dignity. It can only be realised if the international community puts an end to Israel's crime of genocide; removes the illegal blockade on the Gaza Strip; and salvages what remains of the besieged enclave, which is currently uninhabitable on all fronts. Delays will cause the Strip to deteriorate further, cost more civilian lives, and heavily affect people's health outcomes.The international community must act swiftly and forcefully to end to Israel's crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, which involves both the direct killing of, and the imposition of unbearable living conditions on, the Palestinian people there.",

The tacit or open support by several Western governments of the ongoing escalation and the indiscriminate pager and walkie-talkie bombings of 17 and 18 September - that resulted in the deaths of at least 37 people, including two children and left around 2931 others injured, with children and health workers among the victims - are unacceptable. The bombing and raising of habitation buildings for the purpose of assassinations cannot be defined \"as a measure of justice\" as American President Joe Biden has done, legitimising a view of international relations that entirely substitutes violence to Law.International leaders have a responsibility to show restraint and fairness in a situation in which every escalation causes civilian casualties and suffering on a massive scale. Governments are urged to impose sanctions such as an arms embargo on Israel for its gross violations of international law."

    "summary": "The ongoing conflict in Gaza has resulted in extensive civilian harm, with explosive weapons in densely populated areas causing significant casualties and forced displacement. Urgent action is necessary to protect civilians from escalating violence and ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid [1]. The situation is exacerbated by logistical challenges faced by organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which struggles to deliver agricultural aid due to restrictions at crossings and the collapse of law and order [11]. FAO is prepared to provide more support to Gazan farmers and herders once access and security conditions improve [19].\n\nThe forced movement of populations has disrupted the operations of aid partners, leading the World Food Programme (WFP) to halt food basket distributions in Gaza due to critically restricted flows of essential goods [21]. Israeli airstrikes have targeted UN-run schools sheltering displaced Palestinians, causing fatalities and injuries, including among children and women [31][34][37]. In one instance, airstrikes on a mosque and the Ibn Rushd School in Al-Zawaida killed at least 24 Palestinians and injured 93 others [32][33]. These attacks have forced families to move from one area to another, only to be bombed in the shelters where they seek refuge [35].\n\nThe humanitarian crisis is compounded by poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, which are primary drivers of disease in Gaza [46]. The lack of clean water and hygiene products has led to outbreaks of diarrhea and skin diseases [41], while the breakdown of sanitation infrastructure has increased disease vectors [42]. The collapse of waste management systems, including hazardous medical waste, further contaminates the environment [45]. Overcrowding in shelters and the inability to maintain hygiene severely impact health, with the risk of epidemics rising [47][45].\n\nIsraeli airstrikes have devastated Gaza's infrastructure, damaging over 370,000 housing units and destroying 79,000 homes [52]. Approximately 68% of cropland and roads have been severely damaged, leading to overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions [57]. Food scarcity and the lack of clean water exacerbate health issues, with only 17 of 36 hospitals remaining partially functional due to a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water [52].\n\nThe conflict has severely impacted maternity care, contributing to increased miscarriages, obstetric complications, and premature births due to stress, malnutrition, and inadequate healthcare [61]. Ala'a, a pregnant woman, was forced to deliver her baby in a field hospital in Khan Younis after experiencing early labor and multiple evacuations [70][61]. Despite the challenges, Ala'a and her newborn recovered well, thanks to the dedicated health staff [67][70]. However, continuous support for health services is impossible without a ceasefire and sustained funding [68].\n\nIndividuals like Taleen Al-Hinnawi and Nada Al-Gharib have been profoundly affected by the conflict. Taleen lost her father and now lives in the Al-Baraka orphanage camp, where she struggles with shock and sadness [71]. Nada lost her father and brother and was injured in a strike on their tent in Khan Younis [72][73]. Despite the hardships, both individuals find a sense of community and resilience among those who share similar experiences [71][78].\n\nThe conflict has also led to significant damage to civilian infrastructure in the West Bank, including the demolition of over 2,000 Palestinian homes and damage to public infrastructure [201]. This has resulted in forced displacement and increased mental health concerns among the population [202]. Women in Gaza face additional burdens, becoming heads of households and navigating survival amidst destruction [211]. Children experience profound trauma, with many suffering from anxiety, severe injuries, and disrupted education [214][216].\n\nHumanitarian organizations are addressing these challenges by providing support in shelters, health points, and through vaccination programs [211]. Oxfam and UNICEF are calling for a ceasefire, humanitarian access, and accountability for violations of international law [216]. The international community is urged to end arms sales that fuel the violence and to hold perpetrators accountable for serious violations [172][174].\n\nThe conflict has severely impacted essential services and resources in Gaza, with hundreds of thousands lacking access to food and clean water [247]. The destruction of agricultural land and infrastructure has limited food availability, while water contamination and damaged infrastructure exacerbate health risks [243][244]. The UN and humanitarian partners have developed a Winterization Plan to address critical needs, but interventions are hindered by restricted access and resource availability [245][249].\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) calls for a de-escalation of the conflict, protection of healthcare, and a ceasefire to ensure peace and access to essential services [151]. The international community's response to calls for a ceasefire has been mixed, with ongoing military support to Israel complicating efforts [179]. Despite these challenges, organizations continue to advocate for an immediate and lasting ceasefire and accountability for violations of international humanitarian law [173][174].",

Moreover, the destruction of coastal areas and marine habitats due to military operations and pollution run-off threatens Gaza's marine ecosystem, thus impacting biodiversity and jeopardising livelihoods.The alteration of the landscape through widespread destruction and the potential for future urban development plans could lead to irreversible changes in the local ecosystem. The contamination of soil and water resources may persist for years, hampering future agricultural productivity and access to safe drinking water. The loss of arable land due to pollution, erosion, and potential salinisation could have severe implications for food security in a region already grappling with resource scarcity.Deforestation presents another critical environmental challenge.",
      "243": "The destruction of trees, including Gaza's iconic olive groves, is occurring through multiple mechanisms. Direct damage from bombings and fires has obliterated vast swathes of vegetation. One of the most pressing concerns is the contamination of water sources. The intensive bombardment has damaged water infrastructure, leading to the mixing of sewage and potable water supplies.",
      "242": "This environmental catastrophe, which some experts are terming ecocide', threatens to have long-lasting consequences that extend far beyond the current conflict, affecting the region's ecology, public health, and future habitability. Moreover, this environmental destruction fundamentally undermines the human dignity of Gaza's residents, depriving them of their basic rights to a clean and healthy environment.The conflict's impact on Gaza's ecosystem extends beyond the immediate destruction of flora and fauna. The region's biodiversity is under severe threat as habitats are destroyed and food chains disrupted. The loss of vegetation, particularly trees, has far-reaching consequences for local wildlife."

    "summary": "The situation in Gaza is dire, with multiple challenges affecting the delivery of aid and the living conditions of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) faces significant logistical challenges due to restrictions at crossings and the collapse of law and order, which hinder the delivery of agricultural aid into Gaza. Despite these obstacles, FAO is prepared to provide more inputs to Gazan farmers and herders once access, security, and mobility conditions are restored[1][9].\n\nIDPs in Gaza are living in extremely poor conditions, characterized by worn-out tents, a lack of mattresses, and insufficient food, water, and sanitation[11][12][22]. The approaching adverse weather conditions exacerbate these challenges[12]. The lack of basic necessities has led to a spread of skin diseases and an acute shortage of medications[16][21]. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable due to the limited availability of sanitary pads and dignity kits, increasing their risk of disease and gender-based violence (GBV)[12][22][23]. An estimated 800,000 dignity kits are needed, far exceeding the 1,900 distributed by partners[20][25].\n\nShelter conditions are inadequate, with a shortage of tents affecting the ability to provide psychosocial support and safe spaces for unaccompanied children[11][12][22][23]. Cash shortages further impact living conditions, increasing the risk of violence or exploitation for women and girls[15][27][28]. Food and water shortages are severe, with exorbitantly high food prices making basic items unaffordable[22][24][31][34]. Vegetables are ten times more expensive than before the conflict, and a kilo of tomatoes costs nearly 8-10[24][34].\n\nEfforts to address these challenges include UNRWA's protection teams identifying and responding to protection risks, and partners monitoring IDP sites and providing awareness sessions[21][25]. Child Protection partners are planning winterization activities, and GBV partners have distributed dignity kits, though the need far exceeds the supply[25][26]. Measures to provide food and water include distributing hot meals, food packs, and clean water to displaced people in shelters[61][62]. However, the World Food Programme (WFP) has ceased food basket distributions due to restricted flow of essential goods[41].\n\nThe conflict has severely impacted essential services and resources in Gaza. The Israeli military's Operation Iron Swords included a complete blockade, leading to a death toll exceeding 41,800 since October 7, with thousands missing under rubble[51][52][56]. Heavy strikes have been reported across northern Gaza, with roads closed and shelters targeted, including a mosque and a school[51][53][56][58]. The Israeli army has ordered evacuations, but many residents are unwilling to move due to perceived dangers[51].\n\nFood insecurity is a critical issue, with 745,000 people facing emergency levels and 495,000 facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity[71]. Israel is reportedly blocking deliveries of food and medicine, contributing to indirect deaths from starvation[78][80]. Oxfam and other organizations are calling for a ceasefire and full humanitarian access to Gaza[75][77]. The destruction of agricultural land and infrastructure has limited access to food, with ongoing bombardments and fuel shortages forcing bakeries to shut down[83][84]. The contamination of water resources and destruction of water infrastructure further complicate access to safe drinking water[83][84].\n\nThe UN and humanitarian partners have developed a Winterization Plan to address critical needs, but interventions are hindered by the lack of unimpeded entry of humanitarian items and safe movement[85][89]. The situation remains precarious, with hundreds of thousands lacking access to basic necessities like food and clean water[87].",

Moreover, the destruction of coastal areas and marine habitats due to military operations and pollution run-off threatens Gaza's marine ecosystem, thus impacting biodiversity and jeopardising livelihoods.The alteration of the landscape through widespread destruction and the potential for future urban development plans could lead to irreversible changes in the local ecosystem. The contamination of soil and water resources may persist for years, hampering future agricultural productivity and access to safe drinking water. The loss of arable land due to pollution, erosion, and potential salinisation could have severe implications for food security in a region already grappling with resource scarcity.Deforestation presents another critical environmental challenge.",
      "83": "The destruction of trees, including Gaza's iconic olive groves, is occurring through multiple mechanisms. Direct damage from bombings and fires has obliterated vast swathes of vegetation. One of the most pressing concerns is the contamination of water sources. The intensive bombardment has damaged water infrastructure, leading to the mixing of sewage and potable water supplies.",
      "82": "This environmental catastrophe, which some experts are terming ecocide', threatens to have long-lasting consequences that extend far beyond the current conflict, affecting the region's ecology, public health, and future habitability. Moreover, this environmental destruction fundamentally undermines the human dignity of Gaza's residents, depriving them of their basic rights to a clean and healthy environment.The conflict's impact on Gaza's ecosystem extends beyond the immediate destruction of flora and fauna. The region's biodiversity is under severe threat as habitats are destroyed and food chains disrupted. The loss of vegetation, particularly trees, has far-reaching consequences for local wildlife."

    "summary": "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) faces significant logistical challenges in delivering agricultural aid to Gaza, primarily due to restrictions at crossings and the collapse of law and order, which severely constrain their efforts[1]. Despite these obstacles, FAO is prepared to provide more inputs to Gazan farmers and herders once conditions of access, security, and mobility are restored[9]. However, the current strategies to address these challenges remain unspecified.\n\nIn Gaza, the destruction of homes and infrastructure has profoundly affected the daily lives of residents. An Islamic Relief staff member reported that their own house is damaged and uninhabitable, and that their siblings and colleagues have also lost their homes[21]. The staff member further noted that their Islamic Relief office, along with children's schools, a mosque, a hospital, restaurants, and a church, have been destroyed, leading to a systematic dismantling of their lives[21]. The extent of the destruction is so severe that even if the conflict were to cease, returning to their homes would be impossible[21].\n\nCivilian infrastructure, including schools, religious buildings, hospitals, and bakeries, has been decimated[22]. The healthcare system has been systematically dismantled, with most primary healthcare centers out of action[23][26]. Critical services such as oncology, MRI, specialized pediatric surgery, and endocrinology are no longer available[24]. The lack of electricity, except for generators that are costly to operate due to high fuel prices, has led to a significant drop in access to essential services like water, food, and education, creating a \"real shock\" for the population[28]. Additionally, there is a rise in infectious diseases, including gastroenteritis from polluted water, skin infections, and hepatitis A[26].\n\nIn the West Bank, military operations have caused significant damage to civilian infrastructure, including the forced demolition of over 2,000 Palestinian homes and extensive damage to public infrastructure such as roads[31]. This widespread destruction, coupled with increased violence, movement restrictions, and economic disruption, severely impacts daily life and contributes to extreme mental distress and heightened mental health concerns among the population[31][32]. These conditions have also led to forced displacement[32].\n\nThe Civil Defense first responders, operating under the Hamas-run government, have reported difficulties in reaching several hit homes and buildings due to ongoing bombardment[11]. This further exacerbates the challenges faced by the residents of Gaza, who are already struggling with the aftermath of extensive infrastructure damage and the collapse of essential services.",

However, increasing restrictions on the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid, including destruction of infrastructure, bureaucratic impediments, Israeli attacks on aid convoys and killings of aid workers, mean that many Palestinians in Gaza are not getting the aid they need to survive.As the only way to protect Palestinian lives, and enable the release of the remaining hostages, the IRC continues to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire.",

    "summary": "Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza are enduring severe hardships due to the ongoing conflict and its devastating impact on infrastructure and essential services. The conditions in IDP sites are dire, characterized by worn-out tents, a lack of mattresses, and insufficient food, water, and sanitation facilities, which are exacerbated by the approaching adverse weather conditions [1][2][12]. The shortage of basic necessities has led to a continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications, further affecting the health of the displaced population [6][11]. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable due to the limited availability of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) kits and dignity kits, with over 800,000 kits needed compared to the 1,900 distributed [2][10][12][13]. This shortage increases their risk of disease and gender-based violence (GBV) [2][12][13].\n\nThe conflict has also severely impacted food security, with exorbitantly high food prices and a major shortage of food and water [12][21][24]. Vegetables are ten times more expensive than before the war, and a kilo of tomatoes costs nearly 8-10 [14][24]. The scarcity of food and clean water has led to outbreaks of diarrhea and skin diseases [51]. Cash shortages further hinder the use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA), negatively affecting living conditions and increasing the risk of violence or exploitation for women and girls [5][17][18][26].\n\nIsraeli airstrikes have compounded these challenges by targeting shelters, including schools and mosques, resulting in numerous fatalities and injuries among displaced civilians [41][42][43][44][47]. The strikes have damaged over 370,000 housing units, completely destroying 79,000 homes, and severely affected 68% of cropland and roads [52]. This destruction has led to overcrowding and appalling sanitary conditions, with only 17 of 36 hospitals remaining partially functional due to a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water [52][112].\n\nEfforts to address these challenges include UNRWA's protection teams identifying and responding to protection risks, and partners distributing dignity kits and providing psychosocial support [11][15][16]. However, the need far exceeds the available resources, and humanitarian aid movement remains dangerous, with aid convoys often blocked or shot at [123][129]. The World Food Programme (WFP) has ceased food basket distributions due to restricted flow of essential goods [31].\n\nThe conflict has also had a profound impact on individuals like Taleen Al-Hinnawi and Nada Al-Gharib, who have lost family members and face the challenge of adjusting to life in orphanage camps [61][62][63]. Despite the hardships, they find a sense of community and resilience among fellow displaced persons [61][68].\n\nThe Israeli military's Operation Iron Swords has included a complete blockade of the Gaza Strip, leading to a death toll exceeding 41,800 and thousands missing under rubble [71][72][76]. The blockade has resulted in severe food insecurity, with 745,000 people facing emergency levels and 495,000 facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity [121][130]. Israel's actions, including the destruction of agricultural lands and blocking of food and medicine deliveries, have contributed to famine conditions [132][134].\n\nHumanitarian organizations are working to mitigate these challenges by providing hot meals, clean water, and nutritional supplements to displaced families [81][82][86]. Oxfam and UNICEF are advocating for a ceasefire, humanitarian access, and accountability for the destruction and deprivation faced by Gaza's population [116][125]. Despite these efforts, the situation remains critical, with the destruction of infrastructure and essential services continuing to impact daily life and exacerbate the suffering of Gaza's residents [91][92][93][98].",

While the population of Gaza is fully aware of and accustomed to the hygiene practices necessary for their health, they unfortunately no longer have access to them.Unsurprisingly, all these war impacts are creating the conditions for the resurgence of waterborne diseases. Without access to soap, water, or toilets, and in such crowded conditions, the risk of epidemics is skyrocketing.",

The constant Israeli attacks have damaged more than 370,000 housing units; 79,000 homes have been destroyed completely. About 68 of cropland and roads have also been severely damaged. As of September 2024, only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, while all suffer from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water.",
      "51": "Like the rest of Gaza, this area has not been spared from Israeli air strikes, proving this zone is far from safe. The area is incredibly overcrowded, and sanitary conditions are appalling. Food is scarce and the lack of clean water and hygiene products is causing outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases. Shampoo, detergent, and dishwashing liquid are largely absent from the market, or available at skyrocketing prices, which most people in Gaza cannot afford.",

Instead, we have focused on responding to the emergency.Over the last year, we have helped feed people displaced people in shelters with hot meals, food packs, vegetables and vouchers. We have also distributed desperately needed clean water and nutritional supplements to people in shelters. Now, more than 16,400 children are receiving a monthly stipend, as well as food parcels and gifts at Ramadan and Eid.",
      "98": "I have never seen a crisis with such a drop in the level of access to services for the population, notes Kathleen Hamon, despite the restrictions that Palestinians have faced for years. Most were living until now in conditions like those we have in Europe in terms of access to water, food, and education. So this is a real shock. Today, there is no electricity in Gaza, except for a few generators whose operation is hindered by the exorbitant price of fuel.",
      "96": "I was alone with my only pet, my cat, moving from one place to another,\" he says.Gaza's healthcare system is in tatters. According to the UN, only 17 hospitals are partially functioning while 19 are completely out of service. Most primary healthcare centres are also out of action, and less than half of patients in critical need of treatment are able to get out of Gaza.As well as conflict-related injuries, Mughaisib and his colleagues must treat wider health issues. He says they are seeing a rise in infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis  spread through polluted water  skin infections and hepatitis A.Aid agencies have repeatedly sounded the alarm about access to food and clean water.",
      "94": "Other critical services, such as oncology and MRI services, specialized pediatric surgery and endocrinology services also are out of commission. \"At least 24,090 people are suffering from life-changing injuries due to the conflict, with no access to rehabilitation or specialized care,\" Saparbekov said. \"We are deeply concerned about the conflict's impact on mental health in Gaza, where more than 485,000 people had already been diagnosed with mental disorders before the war. \"The WHO flags malnutrition as another major concern.",
      "93": "Meanwhile, the health care system in Gaza has been systematically dismantled by Israeli forces. \"Well before October 7, MSF was already treating people in Gaza suffering from the effects of Israel's 17-year occupation, blockade, and recurrent attacks. Teams have cared for patients with life-altering physical injuries, severe burns, and mental health conditions.Attacks on health care leave few medical optionsAs medical needs are growing exponentially, people's options for care are shrinking. Israeli forces have committed widespread and systematic attacks on Gaza's health care system and other vital civilian infrastructure.",
      "92": "However, these figures do not factor in those who remain unaccounted for, or who have died of diseases and pre-existing health conditions due to the decimation of the health system. This has been compounded by the destruction of 60 of Gaza's structures due to fighting and bombardment, including civilian infrastructure such as schools, religious buildings, hospitals and bakeries.Amidst these dire conditions, humanitarian organizations, including the IRC and our partners, have been working to deliver humanitarian relief to Palestinians in Gaza. However, increasing restrictions on the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid, including destruction of infrastructure, bureaucratic impediments, Israeli attacks on aid convoys and killings of aid workers, mean that many Palestinians in Gaza are not getting the aid they need to survive.As the only way to protect Palestinian lives, and enable the release of the remaining hostages, the IRC continues to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire.",
      "91": "Despite the efforts and successes of the team, the sanitary situation remains a major threat to the people of Gaza. I could never have imagined seeing such things one day, reports Kathleen Hamon, from the Emergency Office of SOLIDARITS INTERNATIONAL. The situation is catastrophic. The level of destruction is such that, even if the conflict were to stop now, people could not return to their homes.",
      "102": "The extreme mental distress that is produced by the demolitions and Israeli military operations and settler violence have also increased mental health concerns among the West Bank population.",
      "101": "The situation in the West Bank is deteriorating rapidly. Military operations continue to cause casualties and significant damage to civilian infrastructure. Increased violence, movement restrictions and economic disruption are severely impacting daily life. Civilians and humanitarian workers need protection, and access to affected areas must be ensured.",
      "120": "These long-standing crimes include the illegal blockade, the deliberate isolation of Gaza from the rest of the Palestinian territory and the world, the systematic deprivation of basic human rights to the Strip's residents, and the deliberate destruction of essential services.Since the start of the genocide in Gaza, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army, including around 42,000 recorded by the Gaza Ministry of Health, the majority being women and children. In addition, approximately 100,000 have been injured, with thousands of bodies still lying under the rubble and in the streets, unreachable by rescue and medical teams.An estimated 10 per cent of Gaza's population has been killed, injured, reported missing, or detained as a result of Israeli military assaults. Of the 50,292 Palestinians killedincluding those still buried under the debris33 per cent were women, and 21 per cent were children.

However, the implementation of planned interventions cannot happen in the absence of unimpeded entry of required humanitarian items into Gaza, the availability of adequate quantities of fuel and facilitation of safe humanitarian movement between warehouses and distribution points. The ongoing challenges faced by humanitarian actors in accessing northern Gaza are particularly concerning, as some parts, historically, have a high potential for flooding.- The ongoing crisis in Gaza will set children's education \"back by up to five years and risks creating a lost generation of permanently traumatized Palestinian youth,\" according to a new study by the University of Cambridge, the Centre for Lebanese Studies and UNRWA.

The contamination of soil and water resources may persist for years, hampering future agricultural productivity and access to safe drinking water. The loss of arable land due to pollution, erosion, and potential salinisation could have severe implications for food security in a region already grappling with resource scarcity.Deforestation presents another critical environmental challenge.",
      "133": "The destruction of trees, including Gaza's iconic olive groves, is occurring through multiple mechanisms. Direct damage from bombings and fires has obliterated vast swathes of vegetation. One of the most pressing concerns is the contamination of water sources.

      "132": "This environmental catastrophe, which some experts are terming ecocide', threatens to have long-lasting consequences that extend far beyond the current conflict, affecting the region's ecology, public health, and future habitability. Moreover, this environmental destruction fundamentally undermines the human dignity of Gaza's residents, depriving them of their basic rights to a clean and healthy environment.The conflict's impact on Gaza's ecosystem extends beyond the immediate destruction of flora and fauna. The region's biodiversity is under severe threat as habitats are destroyed and food chains disrupted. The loss of vegetation, particularly trees, has far-reaching consequences for local wildlife."

    "summary": "Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza are enduring severe hardships due to a combination of inadequate shelter, food, and sanitation, exacerbated by ongoing conflict and adverse weather conditions. The sites visited by UNRWA protection monitors reveal dire conditions characterized by worn-out tents and tarpaulins, a lack of mattresses, key non-food items (NFIs), and insufficient food, water, and sanitation[1][2][12]. The shortage of tents not only limits the expansion of group-based psychosocial support but also hinders the provision of safe spaces or temporary accommodation for unaccompanied children[1][2][12][13]. The capacity to conduct repairs or provide alternative housing is severely limited, leaving families in damaged buildings with little more than awareness-raising support[12].\n\nThe scarcity of basic necessities has led to a continued spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications[6][11]. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable due to the limited availability of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) and dignity kits, which increases their risk of disease and gender-based violence (GBV)[2][12][13]. An estimated need for over 800,000 dignity kits starkly contrasts with the mere 1,900 distributed by partners[10][15]. Cash shortages further exacerbate living conditions, increasing the risk of violence or exploitation for women and girls and undermining the ability of partners to pay local service providers and staff salaries[5][17][18].\n\nThe conflict has severely impacted the availability of essential services and resources. Israeli air strikes have damaged over 370,000 housing units, completely destroying 79,000 homes, and severely affected 68% of cropland and roads[32]. This destruction has led to overcrowding and appalling sanitary conditions, with food scarcity and a lack of clean water causing outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases[31][37]. The blockade of the Gaza Strip as part of Operation Iron Swords has resulted in a death toll exceeding 41,800, with thousands more missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings[41][42][46]. The strikes have targeted shelters, including mosques and schools, killing those seeking refuge there[41].\n\nEfforts to address these challenges include UNRWA's protection teams identifying and responding to protection risks in areas like Khan Younis and Deir al Balah[15]. Protection Monitors conduct awareness sessions, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, while monitoring aid distribution and following up on vulnerable cases[11]. The Site Management Working Group (SMWG) partners have monitored 38 sites hosting approximately 170,875 people[11]. Child Protection partners are planning winterization activities, including procuring psychosocial support kits and winter clothes[16]. Despite these efforts, the distribution of dignity kits remains far below the estimated need, and the GBV sub-cluster is assessing the potential for cash assistance to address urgent needs[14][15].\n\nThe primary drivers of disease in Gaza are the poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, worsened by overcrowding in shelters[26]. The breakdown of sanitation infrastructure has led to a proliferation of disease vectors, and the collapse of waste management systems contributes to contamination[22][25]. The lack of clean water and hygiene products is causing outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases, with the risk of epidemics skyrocketing due to the inability to maintain minimal hygiene standards[21][25][27].\n\nMeasures to provide food and water to displaced people include distributing hot meals, food packs, vegetables, and vouchers, along with clean water and nutritional supplements[51]. Over 40 million hot meals have been distributed, and water is provided to 110,000 people daily[51][52]. Nutritional supplements are supplied to 35,000 pregnant women and young children every two weeks, and a Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition program has been launched[52][56].\n\nThe destruction of agricultural land and infrastructure has severely limited access to food, with ongoing bombardments and fuel shortages forcing bakeries to shut down[73][74]. The contamination of soil and water resources may persist for years, hampering access to safe drinking water[74]. The UN and humanitarian partners have developed a Winterization Plan to address critical needs, but interventions are hindered by the lack of unimpeded entry of humanitarian items, fuel availability, and safe humanitarian movement[75][79]. The approaching rainy season is expected to further deteriorate living conditions, putting hundreds of thousands at heightened risk of health hazards and limited access to essential services[77].",

However, the implementation of planned interventions cannot happen in the absence of unimpeded entry of required humanitarian items into Gaza, the availability of adequate quantities of fuel and facilitation of safe humanitarian movement between warehouses and distribution points. The ongoing challenges faced by humanitarian actors in accessing northern Gaza are particularly concerning, as some parts, historically, have a high potential for flooding.- The ongoing crisis in Gaza will set children's education \"back by up to five years and risks creating a lost generation of permanently traumatized Palestinian youth,\" according to a new study by the University of Cambridge, the Centre for Lebanese Studies and UNRWA.

The contamination of soil and water resources may persist for years, hampering future agricultural productivity and access to safe drinking water. The loss of arable land due to pollution, erosion, and potential salinisation could have severe implications for food security in a region already grappling with resource scarcity.Deforestation presents another critical environmental challenge.",
      "73": "The destruction of trees, including Gaza's iconic olive groves, is occurring through multiple mechanisms. Direct damage from bombings and fires has obliterated vast swathes of vegetation. One of the most pressing concerns is the contamination of water sources. The intensive bombardment has damaged water infrastructure, leading to the mixing of sewage and potable water supplies.",
      "72": "This environmental catastrophe, which some experts are terming ecocide', threatens to have long-lasting consequences that extend far beyond the current conflict, affecting the region's ecology, public health, and future habitability. Moreover, this environmental destruction fundamentally undermines the human dignity of Gaza's residents, depriving them of their basic rights to a clean and healthy environment.The conflict's impact on Gaza's ecosystem extends beyond the immediate destruction of flora and fauna. The region's biodiversity is under severe threat as habitats are destroyed and food chains disrupted. The loss of vegetation, particularly trees, has far-reaching consequences for local wildlife."

    "summary": "Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Gaza are enduring severe hardships, living in conditions marked by worn-out tents, a lack of mattresses, and insufficient food, water, and sanitation, as observed by UNRWA protection monitors[1][2]. The approaching adverse weather conditions exacerbate these challenges[2]. The scarcity of basic necessities has led to the spread of skin diseases and an acute lack of medications[6]. IDPs express deep distress over the inadequate assistance they receive[2]. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable due to the limited availability of sanitary pads, dignity, and menstrual hygiene management (MHM) kits, with over 800,000 dignity kits needed compared to the 1,900 distributed by partners[2][10]. The shortage of blankets, shoes, warm clothes, and other winter items is expected to worsen their suffering[9]. Additionally, the lack of tents hinders the expansion of group-based psychosocial support and the provision of safe spaces or temporary accommodation for unaccompanied children[1][2]. Cash shortages further deteriorate living conditions and increase the risk of violence or exploitation for women and girls[5].\n\nThe situation is compounded by Israeli airstrikes, which have recently targeted at least six UN-run schools sheltering displaced Palestinians, resulting in tens of fatalities, including children and women[11][14][17]. In particular, airstrikes on a mosque and the Ibn Rushd School in Al-Zawaida killed at least 24 Palestinians, including children, and injured 93 others[12][13]. These attacks force families to move from one area to another, only to be bombed in the schools and tents where they seek refuge[15]. The constant Israeli attacks have damaged over 370,000 housing units, completely destroying 79,000 homes, and severely affected 68% of cropland and roads[22]. This has led to overcrowding and appalling sanitary conditions, with food scarcity and a lack of clean water and hygiene products causing outbreaks of diarrhoea and skin diseases[21]. As of September 2024, only 17 of 36 hospitals remain partially functional, suffering from a lack of fuel, medical supplies, and clean water due to ongoing attacks[22].\n\nThe Israeli military's Operation Iron Swords has imposed a complete blockade on the Gaza Strip, resulting in a death toll exceeding 41,800 since October 7, according to the enclave's health ministry[41]. Thousands are reported missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings[46]. Heavy strikes have been reported across northern Gaza, with dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling[43][46]. The Israeli army has issued evacuation orders, leading residents to flee without knowing where to go or having means of transportation[41]. Strikes have targeted shelters, including a mosque and a school, killing those seeking refuge there[41]. Hunger is spreading due to the lack of basic supplies, and residents are ordered to move to the humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, though some are unwilling due to perceived dangers and reports of the army shooting at people there[41][48].\n\nThe destruction of homes and infrastructure has profoundly impacted the daily lives of Gaza residents. An Islamic Relief staff member reported that their house is damaged and uninhabitable, and their colleagues have lost their homes[51]. The staff member also noted that their office, along with children's schools, a mosque, a hospital, restaurants, and a church, has been destroyed, systematically dismantling their lives[51]. Civilian infrastructure, including schools, religious buildings, hospitals, and bakeries, has been destroyed[52]. The healthcare system has been systematically dismantled, with most primary healthcare centers out of action and critical services like oncology and specialized pediatric surgery unavailable[53][54]. There is no electricity in Gaza, except for generators hindered by the high price of fuel, leading to a significant drop in access to services such as water, food, and education[58]. Infectious diseases like gastroenteritis, skin infections, and hepatitis A are on the rise due to polluted water[56].\n\nIn the West Bank, military operations have caused significant damage to civilian infrastructure, including the forced demolition of over 2,000 Palestinian homes and massive damage to public infrastructure, such as roads[61]. This has led to widespread destruction and severe impacts on daily life, contributing to extreme mental distress and increased mental health concerns among the population[61][62]. These operations have also resulted in forced displacement[62].",

However, increasing restrictions on the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid, including destruction of infrastructure, bureaucratic impediments, Israeli attacks on aid convoys and killings of aid workers, mean that many Palestinians in Gaza are not getting the aid they need to survive.As the only way to protect Palestinian lives, and enable the release of the remaining hostages, the IRC continues to call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire.",

The situation has been exacerbated by Israeli airstrikes, which have recently targeted at least six UN-run schools sheltering displaced Palestinians, causing significant concern for the UN about the repeated airstrikes on shelters for displaced people in the Strip[11]. These attacks on buildings serving as shelters for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have become an almost daily occurrence, with at least six schools being struck in the last 72 hours alone, resulting in tens of fatalities, including children and women[14][17].\n\nIn particular, two separate Israeli airstrikes early Sunday morning targeted a mosque and the Ibn Rushd School in Al-Zawaida, both of which were sheltering displaced civilians in central Gaza. These attacks resulted in the deaths of at least 24 Palestinians, including children, and injured 93 others, with some reports indicating 26 fatalities[12][13]. The displaced Palestinian population faces the grim reality of being ordered from one area to another, only to be bombed in the schools and tents where they are told to seek refuge[15].\n\nThe safety and living conditions in Gaza have been severely impacted by Israeli airstrikes, with no areas spared, proving that zones are far from safe[21]. Over 370,000 housing units have been damaged, with 79,000 homes completely destroyed[22]. Additionally, approximately 68% of cropland and roads have been severely damaged[22].

The civilian population in Gaza has suffered immensely, with a death toll exceeding 41,800 since October 7, according to the enclave's health ministry[31]. Other reports indicate over 41,500 killed and almost 100,000 wounded from nearly a year of relentless Israeli attacks, with the death toll nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry[31][32]. Thousands are also reported missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings[36].\n\nHeavy Israeli strikes have been reported across northern Gaza, with dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shaking the ground and buildings[33][36]. Several homes and buildings have been hit, and first responders have been unable to reach them due to the bombardment[36]. Strikes have also been reported in Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, with roads closed and the Jabalia refugee camp surrounded[38].\n\nThe Israeli army has dropped leaflets ordering people to flee their homes and issued evacuation orders, leading residents to leave without knowing where to go or having means of transportation[31][33]. Strikes have targeted shelters, including a mosque and a school, killing those who were sheltering there[31]. Children are suffering, and hunger is spreading and deepening due to the near-total lack of basic supplies[38]. Residents are ordered to move to the humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, but some are unwilling due to perceived dangers and reports of the army shooting at people there[31].",

Additionally, Israel is intentionally blocking deliveries of food and medicine[14].\n\nHumanitarian organizations are actively addressing these challenges. Oxfam partner Juzoor supports hundreds of thousands of people in over 90 shelters and health points across Gaza, while UNICEF has vaccinated thousands of children against polio[11]. Oxfam is advocating for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages and unlawfully detained Palestinians, and an end to all lethal arms sales to Israel. They also demand full humanitarian access to Gaza and urge the international community to enforce accountability by addressing the illegal Israeli occupation, removing settlements in the occupied West Bank, and providing reparations to affected Palestinian communities[16].",
