Protests over skyrocketing power bills also persisted during the monsoon season, with the same group maintaining their sit-in despite the adverse weather conditions[41]. The monsoon season has not been directly linked to the local population's ability to cope with increased costs, but the situation is exacerbated by power bills that have more than doubled for some Pakistanis due to added taxes on top of the base price[41]. For instance, a private school teacher in Lahore reported that half of her salary now goes to the energy bill, making it difficult for her to manage household expenses[41].\n\nIn Pakistan's southwest, thousands protested against police violence, an internet shutdown, and highway closures[21]. However, the sources do not connect these specific grievances to monsoon floods or rains. Similarly, Gwadar's nearly 100,000 residents rely on natural sources such as rain and traditional dams for water[35][51]. The sources do not specify how monsoon floods or rains have exacerbated challenges related to basic necessities for Gwadar residents.\n\nOverall, while the monsoon season has been a backdrop for ongoing protests and economic challenges, the provided sources do not directly link these events to the humanitarian situation in Pakistan or specific regional tensions, such as those between the Baloch population and the federal government[37].",

These protests persisted even as the monsoon season brought significant challenges, such as overwhelming drainage systems in Lahore, leading to urban flooding and electricity suspension[46][44][48]. The monsoon rains caused record rainfall of 337 millimeters in Lahore, resulting in submerged hospitals and road closures[44][48]. Efforts to mitigate these effects include continuous drainage operations by Wasa and instructions for City and District Administrations to ensure contingency plans for flood-vulnerable urban centers[45][46][50]. Rescuers across the province are actively working to assist those affected[42].\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued advisories to remain \"ALERT\" and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situations, predicting that torrential monsoon rains may generate flash flooding and landslides, potentially causing road closures in vulnerable hilly areas[51][57][60]. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is responding by reporting on rain-related incidents and warning of urban and flash flooding in various parts of the country[65][62]. The NDMA advises populations at risk to avoid flood waters and seek safe locations, recommending against crossing rapidly flowing bridges due to their hazardous nature during floods[61][65].\n\nThe National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) forecasts rainfall and thundershowers in southern and northeastern Punjab and northeastern Sindh, which may trigger urban flooding[71]. Populations at risk are advised to ensure roofs and windows are properly sealed to prevent water leakage[71]. The sixth spell of monsoon rains in Punjab, predicted from August 1 to 6, is expected to bring strong winds and thundershowers, with heavy rainfall potentially causing further flooding[81][87].

    "summary": "Despite the pouring monsoon rains, approximately 3,000 supporters of a major Islamist party continued a sit-in protest on a main road into Pakistan's capital, highlighting the resilience of the demonstrators despite adverse weather conditions[1]. In the southwest of Pakistan, thousands protested against police violence, an internet shutdown, and highway closures, although these grievances were not directly linked to the monsoon floods or rains[11]. The monsoon season has been a backdrop for ongoing protests over skyrocketing power bills, with some protesters maintaining their stance despite the heavy rains[35][41]. The increased costs have significantly impacted the local population's ability to cope, as power bills have more than doubled for some Pakistanis due to added taxes, with individuals like a private school teacher in Lahore struggling to manage household expenses as half of her salary now goes to the energy bill[41].\n\nIn Lahore, the monsoon rains have overwhelmed drainage systems, leading to urban flooding, electricity suspension, road closures, and submerged hospitals and low-lying areas[64][66][68]. The city received a record rainfall of 337 millimeters, causing significant disruption as rainwater entered numerous homes[66]. To mitigate these effects, efforts are underway to pump rainwater off main roads, with Wasa's drainage operation continuing without interruption[65][66]. City and District Administrations have been instructed to ensure contingency plans for flood-vulnerable urban centers, including prompt de-watering operations in flooded areas, while rescuers across the province actively assist those in need[62][70]. The NHA, FWO, and Local CW Departments are tasked with ensuring the pre-placement of machinery and timely restoration of damaged road linkages[62].\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an advisory to concerned authorities, instructing them to remain \"ALERT\" and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation[77][80]. The PMD predicts that torrential monsoon rains may generate flash flooding in local nullahs/streams and landslides, potentially causing road closures in vulnerable hilly areas[71][77]. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is actively responding to the monsoon rains by reporting on rain-related incidents, including casualties and damages, and warning of potential urban and flash flooding in various parts of the country[82][85]. The NDMA advises populations at risk to avoid flood waters and seek safe locations, recommending against crossing bridges if water is flowing rapidly due to their hazardous nature during floods[81][85].\n\nThe National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) is addressing the risk of urban flooding by forecasting rainfall and thundershowers in southern and northeastern Punjab and northeastern Sindh, which may trigger urban flooding in these regions[91]. Populations at risk are advised to avoid flood waters and ensure roofs and windows are properly sealed to prevent water leakage[91]. The sixth spell of monsoon rains in Punjab, predicted from August 1 to 6, is expected to bring strong winds and thundershowers, with heavy rainfall potentially causing further flooding[101][107]. Torrential monsoon rains are anticipated to generate flash flooding in local nullahs/streams and cause landslides leading to road closures in vulnerable hilly areas[106]. Intense rain-windstorms and thundershowers with heavy to very heavy rainfall are expected in Punjab from August 1 to 7, 2024, affecting most districts of south Punjab[101][109].\n\nHuman Rights Watch has called for Pakistani authorities to uphold the right to peaceful protest and assembly, urging them to use only the minimum force needed and protect protesters' rights[111]. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials emphasize that security forces must never use excessive force, with firearms only used when other less harmful means are not practicable and to the minimum extent necessary, with lethal force only when strictly unavoidable to protect life[117].

    "summary": "During the monsoon season, protests over skyrocketing power bills persisted, with approximately 3,000 supporters of a major Islamist party maintaining a sit-in despite the heavy rains[1]. The monsoon rains have not been directly linked to the local population's ability to cope with increased costs, but the financial strain is evident as power bills have more than doubled for some Pakistanis due to added taxes on top of the base price[1]. For example, a private school teacher in Lahore reported that half of her salary now goes to the energy bill, making it challenging to manage household expenses[1].\n\nIn Lahore, the monsoon rains have overwhelmed drainage systems, leading to the flooding of several residential areas[26]. Rainwater has entered numerous homes, and the city experienced a record rainfall of 337 millimeters, resulting in urban flooding, electricity suspension, road closures, and submerged hospitals and low-lying areas[24][28]. To address these issues, efforts are underway to pump rainwater off main roads, with Wasa's drainage operation continuing without interruption[25][26]. City and District Administrations have been instructed to ensure contingency plans for flood-vulnerable urban centers, including prompt de-watering operations in flooded areas[30]. Rescuers across the province are actively working to assist those in need, and the NHA, FWO, and Local CW Departments are tasked with ensuring the pre-placement of machinery and timely restoration of damaged road linkages[22].\n\nMeanwhile, in Gwadar, nearly 100,000 residents rely on natural sources such as rain and traditional dams for water[11]. However, the sources do not specify how monsoon floods or rains have exacerbated challenges related to basic necessities for Gwadar residents.",

Officials say the increases were needed to meet conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a 7 billion loan deal made earlier this month.The government has also added a confusing bevy of taxes on top of the base price, adding up to a bill that has more than doubled for some Pakistanis. \"This month I paid 22,000 rupees 80 for my electricity bill, while in May I only paid 10,000 rupees 36,\" said Asma Humayon, who teaches at a private school in the city of Lahore. \"I don't know how to run the kitchen; now half of my salary is going to energy bill.",

Today, Gwadar is still heavily dependent on neighboring Iran for electricity, while its nearly 100,000 residents rely on natural sources such as rain and traditional dams for water.In recent months, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee has emerged as a harsh critic of Chinese investment in Gwadar. The BYC is an influential and popular group in Balochistan, largely due to its peaceful struggle for Baloch rights. It vocally addresses human rights issues plaguing Balochistan, especially enforced disappearances, custodial killings, and the exploitation of Balochistan's resources.",
