    "summary": "The humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip has reached critical levels, with no medical services or humanitarian aid available to the displaced people in the northern region[1]. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have intensified military operations in response to rocket and mortar fire from Rafah, targeting sites used for launching attacks on Israel, including the Kerem Shalom Crossing[11]. These operations, coupled with evacuation orders, have severely disrupted humanitarian activities across Gaza[12]. As a result, approximately 50,000 people evacuated Rafah within 48 hours, and over 150,000 have fled in recent days[12][13][14]. The escalation has affected around 300,000 people, with many sheltering in dire conditions without adequate access to food, water, or essentials[14]. Vulnerable groups, including malnourished infants, the elderly, and those with severe disabilities, are among those forced to move[14].\n\nThe closure of the Rafah crossing, a critical lifeline for Gaza, has exacerbated the situation, cutting off access to fuel and essential supplies[61]. The UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, warned that Israel's evacuation orders would lead to increased civilian deaths and suffering, contravening international humanitarian and human rights laws[41]. He emphasized the dire conditions faced by those remaining in Rafah, who are at risk of indiscriminate bombing and loss of access to basic necessities[43]. The lack of fuel is critically impacting humanitarian operations, with stocks depleting rapidly[70]. Aid agencies are nearly out of food and fuel, and the prioritization of remaining resources for health, water, and communication highlights the severity of the crisis[63][64].\n\nDespite a ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar, which Hamas accepted, Israel's response has been cautious, and the situation remains volatile[71]. The seizure of the Rafah crossing by Israeli forces has halted aid flow, with no trucks entering since May 5[97]. The ongoing military operations have made the crossing an active war zone, further hindering humanitarian efforts[84]. The lack of safe zones in Gaza, coupled with the destruction of towns like Khan Younis, leaves displaced individuals with nowhere secure to go[95][97]. Designated evacuation sites like Al-Mawasi are overstretched and lack vital services, making them unsuitable for hosting large numbers of displaced people[87].\n\nThe conflict has severely affected the ability of humanitarian teams to operate in Rafah, with a dire shortage of fuel impacting everything from food distribution to hospital operations[95]. The closure of crossings has led to increased hunger and scarcity, with aid agencies struggling to meet the needs of the population[96]. The situation remains fluid, with active hostilities and no clear resolution in sight[82]. The international community continues to call for accountability and adherence to humanitarian laws to protect civilians and ensure the delivery of essential aid[43].",

I can see no way that the latest evacuation orders, much less a full assault, in an area with an extremely dense presence of civilians, can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law and with the two sets of binding provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.At this desperate moment, exacerbated by acts impeding the entry of humanitarian aid in Gaza through the three crossings, there is a dire shortage of fuel, which is hindering everything  from the movement to distribution of food, operation of hospitals and emergency services, sewage treatment and telecommunications.",

Patients and healthcare workers forced to leave must be urgently protected.The international community knows that this invasion will be a catastrophe. The killing of civilians will accelerate and much more of Gaza's remaining infrastructure will be destroyed. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted, just days after the head of the World Food Programme assessed that northern Gaza is experiencing \"full blown famine\" that is \"moving its way south\".The UK and other governments allied with Israel must work urgently to stop this assault from going ahead, avert a further humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and attain a permanent ceasefire."

Vulnerable groups, including malnourished infants, the elderly, and those with severe disabilities, are among those forced to move [14].\n\nThe closure of the Rafah crossing, a critical entry point for aid, has exacerbated the situation, cutting off access to fuel and essential supplies [61]. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reports that no aid or fuel has entered Gaza, which is disastrous for the humanitarian response [55][65]. Fuel stocks are critically low, with only 30,000 litres of diesel available, while 200,000 litres are needed daily [63][64][66][69]. The lack of fuel affects everything from food distribution to hospital operations and telecommunications [105]. Aid agencies are nearly out of food and fuel, with stocks depleting hourly [70][97]. The prioritization of remaining fuel for health, water, and communication services highlights the impact on daily life [63].\n\nThe UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, has warned that Israel's evacuation orders in Rafah will increase civilian deaths and suffering, contravening international humanitarian and human rights laws [41]. Palestinians remaining in Rafah are at risk of death and injury from indiscriminate bombing and lack of access to essentials [43]. Türk emphasized the need for accountability for those disregarding international laws [43].\n\nDespite a ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar, which Hamas accepted, Israel's rejection of the proposal has dashed hopes for peace [71][72]. Israeli forces have seized the Rafah crossing, further complicating aid delivery [71][84]. The ongoing military operations have made the crossing an active war zone, preventing the entry of aid and fuel [81][88]. The situation remains fluid, with no safe zones in Gaza, and designated evacuation sites like Al-Mawasi are overstretched and unsafe [92][97].\n\nThe conflict has severely hindered humanitarian efforts, with no aid trucks entering since May 5 [107]. The closure of crossings has led to increased hunger and scarcity, as well as fear and confusion among civilians [106][108]. The UN Secretary-General has called for political courage from both Hamas and Israel to secure a ceasefire [115]. However, the main obstacles include Israel's rejection of proposals that do not meet its core demands and its goal to destroy Hamas [111][113][114]. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen, with no immediate resolution in sight.",

    "summary": "The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached critical levels, with significant disruptions to aid operations and severe shortages of essential supplies. Humanitarian efforts have been severely hampered, as ongoing military operations and hostilities in Rafah have turned the area into an active war zone, preventing the entry of aid, fuel, and other critical relief items[3][41][78][84]. The Rafah crossing, a vital lifeline for over a million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, has been seized by Israeli forces, further exacerbating the situation by blocking the passage of people and humanitarian aid[11][74][97]. This closure has severed access to fuel, which is crucial for humanitarian operations, and has curtailed the movement of aid workers[51][76][96].\n\nThe lack of fuel is critically impacting daily life and humanitarian operations, with stocks of critical supplies being depleted by the hour[51][60][87]. Fuel is prioritized for health, water, and communication services, but the shortage has already caused bakeries to stop working, leading to a lack of bread, and has affected the water supply[53][85]. Aid agencies are nearly out of food and fuel, with some food stocks expected to last only until the end of the week[65][87]. The dire shortage of fuel hinders the movement and distribution of food, the operation of hospitals, emergency services, sewage treatment, and telecommunications[95][96].\n\nDesignated evacuation sites like Al-Mawasi are overstretched and lack vital services, making them unsuitable for hosting large numbers of displaced people[21][69][87]. Al-Mawasi, declared a humanitarian zone by Israel, lacks the necessary infrastructure, such as sewage and water systems, and proper roads[21]. Despite some displaced Palestinians believing Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis to be safe, the overall situation indicates a lack of adequate provisions and safety[1][69]. The UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, has warned that Israeli evacuation orders and military operations in Rafah will lead to increased civilian deaths, suffering, and destruction, which are already at unbearable levels[31]. He emphasized that these actions are contrary to international humanitarian and human rights laws, which prioritize the protection of civilians[31][33].\n\nThe ongoing conflict has forced tens of thousands of people to flee, with over 100,000 displaced individuals having nowhere safe to go[62][66][68][69]. The situation remains extremely fluid amid active hostilities, with no safe zones in Gaza[82][97]. Israeli attacks on Rafah and other areas have reduced towns like Khan Younis to rubble, making them unsafe[95][97]. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people is severely disrupted, leading to increased hunger and scarcity[94][96].\n\nEfforts to negotiate a ceasefire have been complicated, with Hamas accepting a proposal from Egypt and Qatar, while Israel expressed reservations, stating the proposal did not meet necessary requirements[61]. The Israeli military has continued to call for evacuations in parts of eastern Rafah, further displacing civilians and sowing fear and confusion[61][98]. The safety of humanitarian workers is also a concern, as the lack of fuel and ongoing hostilities threaten their ability to operate safely[89].\n\nIn summary, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, with critical shortages of fuel and essential supplies, disrupted aid operations, and escalating military actions contributing to a worsening crisis for the civilian population[3][41][78][84][95][96].",

    "summary": "The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, with significant disruptions to operations and a severe lack of essential resources. Humanitarian efforts have been severely hampered, leaving many displaced individuals in horrific conditions without adequate access to food, water, or other essentials[2][3]. Although Al-Mawasi is designated as a humanitarian zone by Israel[3], and some displaced Palestinians perceive Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis as safe[1], the overall lack of provisions and safety measures is evident[1].\n\nThe control of the Rafah border crossing by Israeli forces is seen as a \"dangerous escalation,\" threatening the lives of over a million Palestinians who depend on this crossing as Gaza's primary lifeline[11]. The UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, has warned that Israeli orders for Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah, in anticipation of a new offensive, will exacerbate civilian deaths, suffering, and destruction, which are already at unbearable levels[21]. Gazans are already suffering from bombs, disease, and famine, and are now being forced to relocate again due to escalating military operations in Rafah[21]. Türk argues that these orders violate international humanitarian and human rights laws, which prioritize civilian protection[21]. He further emphasized that Palestinians remaining in Rafah face risks of death and injury from indiscriminate bombing, unlawful killing, or loss of access to food, water, and healthcare[23]. Türk insists that such a situation \"must not be allowed to happen,\" and those ignoring international laws must be held accountable[23].\n\nScott Anderson from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported that no aid is being received, and the crossing area remains an active war zone[31]. The absence of fuel and aid entering the Gaza Strip is disastrous for the humanitarian response[35]. UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini highlighted the need to \"reconstitute our stock to be able to resume distribution in the south of the Gaza Strip\"[36]. The lack of fuel critically impacts humanitarian operations and daily life in Gaza[41]. Fuel, essential for these operations, could run out imminently[41]. Andrea de Domenico from the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) noted that humanitarians have only 30,000 litres of diesel available, while the daily requirement is 200,000 litres[43][44][46][49]. The closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has cut off fuel access, affecting the entry of critical relief items and restricting aid worker movement[41]. Scott Anderson reiterated that no fuel has entered Gaza, which is disastrous for the humanitarian response[45]. Aid agencies are nearly out of fuel[45], and stocks of critical supplies, including fuel, are depleting rapidly[50]. The remaining fuel is prioritized for health, water, and communication, with some reserved for staff movement[43][44]. OCHA is engaging with parties to resume the entry of goods, including fuel[50].\n\nThe conflict has severely affected humanitarian teams' ability to operate and provide aid in Rafah, with a dire shortage of fuel hindering everything from food distribution to hospital operations, emergency services, sewage treatment, and telecommunications[55]. Aid flow through the Rafah crossing has halted, with no aid trucks entering since May 5[57]. The Rafah and Karem Abu Salem crossings, key entry points for limited aid, have been disrupted[58]. Israeli forces have seized the Rafah crossing, blocking the passage for people and humanitarian aid[57]. The closure of the Rafah crossing has also severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing aid worker movement[56].\n\nFurthermore, there are no safe places in Gaza[57], as Israel has repeatedly attacked so-called 'safe zones'[57]. Other towns, like Khan Younis, have been reduced to rubble and remain under attack, making them unsafe[55]. Evacuation orders have uprooted tens of thousands of people in Rafah, sowing fear and confusion among civilians[58]. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted[54], and the closure of crossings will lead to increased hunger and scarcity[56].",

Despite Al-Mawasi being declared a humanitarian zone by Israel, the area lacks the necessary infrastructure, such as sewage, water, and roads, to support displaced individuals adequately[3][11]. Many people are sheltering in dire conditions without sufficient access to food, water, or other essentials[2]. The situation is exacerbated by the ongoing military operations and the closure of the Rafah crossing, which is the main entry point for aid into Gaza[31][39]. This closure has halted the flow of aid and fuel, leaving agencies nearly out of food and fuel, with stocks depleting rapidly[32][35][39].\n\nThe UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, has expressed grave concerns over Israel's evacuation orders in Rafah, warning that they will lead to increased civilian deaths, suffering, and destruction[21].

Many people are walking miles to search for shelter, carrying whatever possessions they can. Extremely vulnerable people including malnourished infants, elderly people, injured and sick patients, and people with severe disabilities are among those ordered to move.

    "summary": "Israel's control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing is considered a \"dangerous escalation\" that threatens the lives of over a million Palestinians who rely on this crossing as the primary lifeline of the Gaza Strip[1]. The ongoing military operations and hostilities in Rafah have severely impacted humanitarian aid delivery, with the crossing area being an active war zone and no aid being received[11][48]. According to Scott Anderson from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), no fuel or aid has entered the Gaza Strip, which is \"disastrous for the humanitarian response\"[15][25]. UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini emphasized the need to \"reconstitute our stock to be able to resume distribution in the south of the Gaza Strip\"[16].\n\nThe lack of fuel is critically impacting humanitarian operations and daily life in Gaza[21]. Fuel, considered critical for humanitarian operations, could run out \"tomorrow\"[21]. Andrea de Domenico, head of the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA), stated that humanitarians have approximately 30,000 litres of diesel available, while they normally use 200,000 litres daily[23][24][26][29]. The closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has cut off access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and restricting the movement of aid workers[21][35]. Aid agencies are nearly out of fuel, and stocks of critical supplies, including fuel, are being depleted hourly[25][30]. Priority for the remaining fuel is given to health, water, and communication, with some reserved for the secure movement of staff[23][24]. The UN aid coordination office (OCHA) is engaging with parties to resume the entry of goods, including fuel[30].\n\nDaily life in Gaza is severely affected, with dwindling supplies of fuel and other basic necessities[22]. The prioritization of fuel for health, water, and communication services highlights the impact on these essential aspects of daily life[23]. The lack of fuel has caused bakeries to stop working, leading to no bread, and has also affected the water supply[55].\n\nHamas accepted a ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar[31]. In response, Israel stated it would send a delegation to negotiate but warned the proposal was far from \"necessary requirements\"[31]. The Israeli military also called on Palestinians in parts of eastern Rafah to \"evacuate immediately\"[31]. This sequence of events, including the \"dashing ceasefire hopes,\" was followed by the seizure of the Rafah crossing by Israeli forces on Tuesday[31][32]. Rafah is the main entry point for aid into Gaza[39]. As a result, no aid or fuel has entered the Gaza Strip, and aid agencies are nearly out of food and fuel[32][39]. Fuel critical for humanitarian operations could run out \"tomorrow,\" and some food stocks might only last until the end of the week[35].\n\nIsraeli evacuation orders and attacks on Rafah have forced tens of thousands and over 100,000 people to flee[32][36][38]. These displaced individuals have nowhere safe to go, as designated evacuation sites like Al-Mawasi are overstretched, lack vital services, and are not safe[39]. People in these areas face impending famine, lack of shelter, spread of disease, and scarce healthcare availability[39]. Israeli ground operations and attacks in Rafah are escalating, bringing more death and displacement[31][38].\n\nHumanitarian teams in Rafah, where well over 1 million people including 600,000 children remain, face significant challenges[51][52][53][56]. No aid, fuel, or critical relief items are entering Gaza, as the crossing area is an active war zone with ongoing military operations and bombardments[54]. The closure of the Rafah crossing has severed access to fuel and curtailed the movement of aid workers[57]. Aid agencies are almost out of food and fuel, with stocks of critical supplies being depleted by the hour[57]. The situation remains extremely fluid amid active hostilities[52]. There are no safe zones in Gaza, and designated evacuation sites like Al Mawasi are unsuitable for hosting large numbers of displaced people, being overstretched and devoid of vital services, lacking capacity, safety assurances, and proper accommodation[57]. The safety of humanitarian workers is also a concern[59].\n\nThe conflict in Gaza has severely affected the ability of humanitarian teams to operate and provide aid in Rafah. There is a dire shortage of fuel, which hinders everything from the movement and distribution of food to the operation of hospitals, emergency services, sewage treatment, and telecommunications[65]. Aid flow through the Rafah crossing has halted, with no aid trucks entering since May 5[67]. The Rafah and Karem Abu Salem crossings, which were key entry points for limited aid, have been disrupted[68]. Israeli forces seized the Rafah crossing and blocked the passage for people and humanitarian aid[67]. No fuel or aid has entered the Gaza Strip, which is disastrous for the humanitarian response[67]. The closure of the Rafah crossing has also severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[66].\n\nFurthermore, there are no safe places in Gaza, as Israel has repeatedly attacked so-called 'safe zones'[67]. Other towns, like Khan Younis, have been reduced to rubble and remain under attack, making them unsafe[65]. Evacuation orders have uprooted tens of thousands of people in Rafah, sowing fear and confusion among civilians[68]. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted, and the closure of crossings will lead to increased hunger and scarcity[64][66].",

These are not safe places.I have repeatedly expressed my alarm about the catastrophic impact of a possible full-scale offensive on Rafah, including the possibility of further atrocity crimes. I can see no way that the latest evacuation orders, much less a full assault, in an area with an extremely dense presence of civilians, can be reconciled with the binding requirements of international humanitarian law and with the two sets of binding provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice.At this desperate moment, exacerbated by acts impeding the entry of humanitarian aid in Gaza through the three crossings, there is a dire shortage of fuel, which is hindering everything  from the movement to distribution of food, operation of hospitals and emergency services, sewage treatment and telecommunications.",

Patients and healthcare workers forced to leave must be urgently protected.The international community knows that this invasion will be a catastrophe. The killing of civilians will accelerate and much more of Gaza's remaining infrastructure will be destroyed. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted, just days after the head of the World Food Programme assessed that northern Gaza is experiencing \"full blown famine\" that is \"moving its way south\".The UK and other governments allied with Israel must work urgently to stop this assault from going ahead, avert a further humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and attain a permanent ceasefire."

    "summary": "Israel's control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing is considered a \"dangerous escalation\" that threatens the lives of over a million Palestinians who rely on this crossing as the primary lifeline of the Gaza Strip[1]. The situation is dire, as no aid or fuel has entered the Gaza Strip, which is disastrous for the humanitarian response[15][47]. The crossing area is an active war zone with ongoing military operations and bombardments, further complicating the delivery of aid[11][34]. According to Scott Anderson from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), the lack of aid is critical, and UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini emphasized the need to \"reconstitute our stock to be able to resume distribution in the south of the Gaza Strip\"[16].\n\nHamas accepted a ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar, but Israel's response was cautious, stating the proposal was far from meeting \"necessary requirements\"[21]. Despite this, the Israeli military called on Palestinians in parts of eastern Rafah to \"evacuate immediately\"[21]. The subsequent seizure of the Rafah crossing by Israeli forces on Tuesday dashed ceasefire hopes and halted the flow of aid, as Rafah is the main entry point for aid into Gaza[21][22][29]. Aid agencies are nearly out of food and fuel, with stocks of critical supplies being depleted by the hour[29][37]. Fuel critical for humanitarian operations could run out \"tomorrow,\" and some food stocks might only last until the end of the week[25][37].\n\nThe closure of the Rafah crossing has severed access to fuel, affecting critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[25][37]. Israeli evacuation orders and attacks on Rafah have forced tens of thousands, including over 100,000 people, to flee[22][26][28]. These displaced individuals have nowhere safe to go, as designated evacuation sites like Al-Mawasi are overstretched, lack vital services, and are not safe[29][37]. People in these areas face impending famine, lack of shelter, spread of disease, and scarce healthcare availability[29]. The conflict in Gaza has severely affected the ability of humanitarian teams to operate and provide aid in Rafah, with a dire shortage of fuel hindering everything from the movement and distribution of food to the operation of hospitals, emergency services, sewage treatment, and telecommunications[45][46].\n\nAid flow through the Rafah crossing has halted, with no aid trucks entering since May 5[47]. The Rafah and Karem Abu Salem crossings, which were key entry points for limited aid, have been disrupted[48]. Israeli forces seized the Rafah crossing and blocked the passage for people and humanitarian aid[47]. The closure of the Rafah crossing has also severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[46]. Furthermore, there are no safe places in Gaza, as Israel has repeatedly attacked so-called 'safe zones'[47]. Other towns, like Khan Younis, have been reduced to rubble and remain under attack, making them unsafe[45]. Evacuation orders have uprooted tens of thousands of people in Rafah, sowing fear and confusion among civilians[48]. The meagre humanitarian aid reaching people will be severely disrupted, and the closure of crossings will lead to increased hunger and scarcity[44][46].",

This lack of infrastructure poses significant challenges for humanitarian efforts, although the specific impacts on aid provision are not detailed in the sources.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Gaza has severely impeded the operations of humanitarian teams, particularly in Rafah, where a dire shortage of fuel affects everything from food distribution to the functioning of hospitals, emergency services, sewage treatment, and telecommunications [15]. The situation is exacerbated by the potential depletion of fuel critical for humanitarian operations [16].\n\nThe flow of aid through the Rafah crossing has been completely halted, with no aid trucks entering since May 5 [17]. The Rafah and Karem Abu Salem crossings, previously key entry points for limited aid, have been disrupted [18]. Israeli forces have seized the Rafah crossing, blocking the passage for both people and humanitarian aid [17]. Consequently, no fuel or aid has entered the Gaza Strip, creating a disastrous situation for the humanitarian response [17]. The closure of the Rafah crossing has also cut off access to fuel, hindering the entry of critical relief items and restricting the movement of aid workers [16].\n\nMoreover, there are no safe places in Gaza, as Israel has repeatedly attacked areas designated as 'safe zones' [17]. Towns like Khan Younis have been reduced to rubble and remain under attack, rendering them unsafe [15]. Evacuation orders have displaced tens of thousands of people in Rafah, causing widespread fear and confusion among civilians [18].
