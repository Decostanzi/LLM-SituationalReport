            "We can now measure success better than ever before.Many initiatives over the last thirty years have contributed to these advancements. The United Nations Secretary-General's call for a \"data revolution\" to equip countries with data systems to track and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals has encouraged countries to invest in better data collection, analysis, and measurement tools. While the increasingly available data shines a spotlight on progress, it also exposes the gaps that remain, including in access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.Consider Amina, a 28-year-old woman living in a remote village in Southeast Asia. Pregnant with her third child, she faced a long journey to the nearest clinic.",
            "In her village, there were no skilled birth attendants, and emergency obstetric care was a distant hope. Unfortunately, Amina's story is not unique. I have met women with similar stories across countries in Asia and in the Pacific, and I have seen firsthand that these inequalities in access are widening not only between countries but also within countries.Health systems are plagued by gender inequality and biases based on displacement and ethnic discrimination. Consequently, indigenous women like Amina are less likely to receive antenatal care, more likely to give birth as teenagers, and much more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes.This raises the question: Are we collecting the data we need to truly accelerate progress?",
            "Who is still going uncounted and unaccounted for?Data is not just numbers; it's the story of people's lives. It provides insights into the health and well-being of individuals. Quality data collection and analysis help us identify service gaps, understand access barriers, and develop targeted interventions for those often left behind, including women, girls, indigenous populations, people with disabilities, the LGBTQIA community, and older persons.In a region that faces rapid population growth in some areas, rapid ageing in others, as well as widespread climate change, conflict, and crises, reliable population data is more important than ever. Inclusive and culturally relevant data, disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, and other factors, is essential to ensuring everyone  every individual  has access to universal sexual and reproductive health and rights.Data on maternal deaths highlights areas where healthcare systems are failing women.",
            "For example, UNFPA's kNOwVAWdata initiative supports ethically sourced quality data to measure the prevalence of violence against women, while protecting confidentiality to ensure no further harm. This includes leveraging new technologies, such as mobile health platforms and geospatial mapping, to reach and document underserved populations. It also means ensuring data drives decision-making at all levels, from local health clinics to national policy forums.Data is the lifeblood of effective, equitable healthcare systems. It shows where we are succeeding and where we are falling short.",
            "It guides our actions and holds us accountable. Yet, people's lives cannot be summed up by a single statistic or reduced to mere data points. Humanity is a diverse tapestry of hopes and dreams, and it is by ensuring every individual is accounted for that we can fulfill our vision: a resilient and equitable future where everyone counts.",
            "Remember we are in a tight funding situation; we can't have allocations not used. The completion means that all the documentation that is required for the audit trail is submitted. Once that is done then the second allocation of 4 million per constituency will be made,\" he said.He said that while a flat allocation will be given to all MPs, an additional 3 million will be provided to constituencies where there is an assessment that the damage is higher. \"So those MPS will be contacted.",
            "title: The Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage Must Listen to Affected Communities  content: By Jocelyn Perry  July 9, 2024As the second meeting of the UN Climate Change UNFCCC Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage begins this week, Refugees International urges inclusion of affected communities in both decision-making processes and direct access to funds.To support these goals, the Climate, Migration  Displacement Platform Steering Group and Refugees International hosted two virtual conversations with members of communities affected by loss and damage in the context of displacement and other forms of mobility to share their experiences, challenges, and best practices with members of the Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage on June 26 and 27, 2024, under Chatham House rules. We organized these discussions in response to requests from Board members to hear from communities affected by displacement and other forms of mobilityas most members of these communities are unable to travel to an event such as a Board meeting due to financial and documentation challenges.Displaced communities are often some of the most marginalized, whether living within their country of origin as internally displaced people or having crossed borders as refugees or through other pathways. Their access to political processesincluding climate adaptationas well as international financing mechanisms are exceedingly limited, though they are often more exposed and more vulnerable to climate hazards than other groups. As regions and communities each experience the climate crisis and related loss and damage differently, the Fund must be both fit for purpose and flexible enough to offer a wide array of solutions to adequately tackle the crisis in each context.",
            "While specifics look different in each regional context that we heard from, across Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, communities have already experienced and are continuing to face loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods; loss of biodiversity, cultural heritage, languages, and practices; loss of access to ancestral homelands and community cohesion; and are experiencing psychological trauma. In light of this, both economic and non-economic loss and damage must be considered and addressed. Simplicity is key for communities to be able to access funds in practice, not just in theory. Affected communities stressed that the primary barriers to accessing funds are accessibility of information, procedures, banking systems, organizational capacity, and time.",
            "Grants should prioritize nature-based solutions and ecosystem restoration to maintain connections between traditional environmental practices and communities, respect Indigenous knowledge, support biodiversity and environmental health, and continue to build local resilience to climate change.Background: What is the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage?Loss and damage is an evolving term within international climate negotiations and policymaking, largely meaning the negative impacts of climate changethose that cannot be mitigated by emissions reduction nor adapted to. After decades of advocacy by civil society and many of the countries most affected by climate change across the Global South, the Fund for responding to loss and damage was agreed to during COP27, negotiated by a transitional committee over the next year, and operationalized at COP28 in Dubai in 2023. The Fund is a World Bank hosted financial intermediary fund, through which the Bank serves as interim trustee and host of the Fund's secretariat; the Board was appointed by respective Parties in early 2024 and first met in April and May.The Fund's stated mandate \"includes a focus on addressing loss and damage to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events.\" A key point for many community-based organizations from the COP28 decision that operationalized the Fund is that the World Bank must allow \"all developing countries to directly access resources from the Fund, including through subnational, national and regional entities and through small grant funding for communities.\"",
            "A more detailed discussion of many of the key issues that the Fund must address and their implications is available from the Heinrich Bll Foundation here.What Will the Second Board Meeting Address?Key issues during this Board meeting include selection of the Fund's Executive Director and Board's host country, additional rules of procedure and 2024 workplan of the Board, access modalities, small grant funding modalities, and triggersthresholds for the Fund more on financial instruments here, and participation of active observers in Board meetings and other proceedings. The full provisional agenda for the meeting is available here.Civil society organizations have been urging the Fund to learn from and improve on other funds, in terms of both participation by civil society and access to small grants directly by communities. While they appear quite bureaucratic, the decisions that the Board makes with respect to the above issues will determine to what extent the Fund is able to achieve these goals.The Heinrich Bll Foundation provides more details on these key issues, and La Ruta del Clima has developed a more detailed look at effective participation in Board meetings. Throughout the week, the Loss and Damage Collaboration network will provide daily updates of the discussions and analysis.What Other Issues are Relevant to Loss and Damage?While the modalities for Fund access are critical to communities' ability to benefit from it, the larger issue remains filling the Fund'that is, ensuring that countries increase their pledges of support to it and that they ultimately deliver on these pledges.",
            "More broadly, appropriate funding and action for adaptation to minimize loss and damage will also be essential, through work on the Global Goal on Adaptation, sufficient funding, and technology and capacity-building support for countries in their national and local adaptation planning processes. Finally, one of the top issues on the agenda for COP29 this year is the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate finance NCQG. To continue to build to the necessary scale of climate finance for loss and damage, the NCQG must include loss and damage and prioritize grants and highly concessional loans."

            "title: 20-million lifeline for farmers  content: 20-million lifeline for farmersIN response to the damage caused by Hurricane Beryl to farmers across Jamaica, United Way of Jamaica UWJ on Friday launched a Farmer's Rehabilitation Fund FRF with the aim of raising up to 20 million to provide immediate and long-term support to affected farming communities.Board chairman at UWJ, Dr Devon Smith, while speaking during the launch held at the offices of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, said the entity is aiming to mobilise resources and provide financial support to affected farmers, specifically in the parishes of Clarendon, St Elizabeth, and Manchester who were more severely impacted by Beryl. \"The Farmer's Rehabilitation Fund will facilitate access to critical resources including seeds, equipment, and financial aid to help farmers restore their livelihood. \"What I am indicating here is that we have an aggressive timeline and it is therefore important that everyone comes on board to ensure that they can support this timeline. \"Each passing day that we are not able to respond is each passing day that we are making it more difficult for the citizens of this country,\" said Smith as he urged private and public organisations to collaborate with the UWJ to strengthen its effort to provide effective assistance for local farmers through the FRF initiative.",
            "\"We know the overall devastation that Hurricane Beryl has had on the agriculture sector, leading to crop and infrastructure damage, life stock losses, soil erosion, and economic challenges for our farmers. As a country we must be able to rally round to support our farmers, our brothers and sisters, those citizens who ensure we have access to food in our families and communities,\" he explained.When asked about the process farmers will have to take to benefit from this programme, senior strategist at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining Michael Pryce explained that representatives of the Jamaica Agricultural Society JAS and the Rural Agricultural Development Authority RADA have started to do registration in the communities and are assessing the damage. Pryce noted that all farmers affected will be able to benefit from the initiative. \"We are not going to be restricting it to only registered farmers, everybody suffered damage, and we will be therethat's a policy-level decision that I am making here, but I don't think as a ministry we would ever decide that we are only doing registered farmers,\" he said.Pryce used the opportunity to encourage all agencies to join the initiative as they aim to help farmers replace other damages.",
            "\"I have been out there since Tuesday and farmers are there, and yes, they want to get back to their farming, but there is no roof and that is also of importance to them. I felt helpless, because as the Ministry of Agriculture we cannot say anything about rebuilding houses, but we have to partner with all agencies within Government to ensure the well-being of the farming population and their relatives is taken care of,\" said Pryce.Chairperson at Seprod and Musson Foundations, Melanie Subratie, while describing the importance of farmers to food distributors across Jamaica, announced a commitment to donating 2 million to the rehabilitation fund. \"We believe our contribution along with the efforts of United Way of Jamaicaand other partners here today will make a significant difference in the lives of those affected and also the lives of everyone else who is dependent on agriculture all the way down the supply chain in Jamaica,\" said Subratie.United Way of Jamaica is part of a global network mandated to mobilising resources for the vulnerable and marginalised groups in the society, including education, health, and income-generating activities."

So you will be informed if you are categorised as a constituency that is severely impacted,\" he said, stressing that the distribution of relief must be done by all members of parliament in a non-partisan way, adding that \"there is no colour or affiliation in a disaster\".According to the prime minister, while the rapid assessment is being undertaken, support will be provided to certain communities where virtually the entire housing stock has been destroyed. He said he has instructed the chief of defence staff to mobilise the Disaster Assistance and Recovery Team, and other supporting units, including the engineers to cover areas such as Rocky Point, Portland Cottage on the south coast of Jamaica  where the damage is greatest  to assist with the rebuilding and recovery.",

            "UNICEF will also support the provision of Infant and Young Child Feeding counselling, including assistance and nutritional supplementations such as iron and folic acid, for breastfeeding and pregnant women. UNICEF will also support for micro-nutrient supplement, high protein biscuit to prevent malnutrition and nutrition packages for malnourished children.Child Protection Children in shelters are generally more exposed to violence and abuse and often require emotional support. UNICEF will establish 10 Child-Friendly Spaces in tent settings, equipped with recreational supplies. In addition, UNICEF will also provide GBVSEA awareness-raising activities and services to children most at-risk.WASH 60 of the population are without power and 70 of the population are without water supply due to power cut across the Island.",
            "This number may change as some systems are back on operation, with auxiliary storage tanks and generator---systems. Hygiene promotion will be a priority humanitarian need and UNICEF plans to deliver WASH dignity kits, cleaning kits to affected families, provide 10-liter water containers for proper water carrying and storage, and provide hand-washing stations in shelters.Cash-based Programming, Families that have lost all their belongings and homes are highly vulnerable, especially in terms of securing adequate food and other essential supplies. UNICEF offered to provide assistance to the Govt through unconditional cash transfers in coordination with other humanitarian actors like WFP. RCO activated UNETT with Co-Chairing by UNICEF and WFP.",

The additional 4 million will be focused largely on helping persons replace their roofing.Holness cautioned Members of Parliament that \"everyone who receives a benefit must sign for it. He lauded the teams, both in the public and private sectors, for working around the clock to bring services back online, even while acknowledging that much work was left to be done.",

The dedication displayed by our team is truly commendable, ensuring that vital resources reach those who need them most. We remain committed to making a meaningful impact in the lives of others,\" said Martinez.In the meantime, social impact specialist at the company Jerome Cowans expressed pride in being a part of an organisation that displays compassion for its communities. \"It's inspiring to witness first-hand the positive change that Carib Cement is making in the people's lives, and I look forward to continuing our social impact mission,\" said Cowans.In response to the company's efforts, pastor of the Denbigh Church of the Nazarene Carlton Bryan said that the community was grateful for CCCL's support.",

Senior Director and Head of Communications at CW Communications Marilyn Sealy remarked on the timeliness of the event: \"As we gather in the wake of Hurricane Beryl, we are reminded of the immense challenges that natural disasters pose to our region, but also of the resilience and solidarity that define the Caribbean spirit. \"Sealy added: \"As a leading provider of digital connectivity solutions across the region, this year's theme resonates deeply with the core values and mission of CW Communications.",
            "We recognize the transformational role that technology plays in driving sustainable development, social inclusion, and economic growth.",
            "The effort is to get across the network and to utilise as many community leaders as possible to work with the Members of Parliament MPs. I know some have said listen, we're not hearing from the teams' that's because of the difficulty in terms of communication,\" said Charles Jr.\"We understand your frustration, we understand that several children are now scared. We understand that several seniors are concerned about their medicines, concerned about where they are staying tonight. In addition, the ministry also provided 612 hygiene kits and 159 cases of water.Noting that the relief outreach is being done with the aid of several non-governmental organisations NGOs, other partners and volunteers, Charles Jr called on other Jamaicans to join in the cause.",
            "\"We're committed in the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to leaving no one behind and so we want to encourage all Jamaicans, particularly those who may be in a better position, to join in the work of rebuilding this nation. If you can assist, reach across, do not wait for a neighbour to ask. Many need the support, but cannot muster up the voice to say, please help me',\" said Charles Jr.\"Those who can volunteer, get out of your house and volunteer. Those who have supplies that can be donated, this is the time, not next week today.",
            "Those who can offer their skills and expertise to help in this rebuilding effort, this is your opportunity,\" he added.The minister said that teams from the other ministries including the local government and community development, education and youth, health and wellness, and NGO's such as Red Cross, and Food for the Poor, have been working alongside the Labour Ministry going house to house to promptly deploy islandwide and to deliver immediate relief supplies, and to conduct the initial damage assessments. \"It's challenging particularly because of those areas where communication is completely down. So for our officers that are going into, or who are in Clarendon, and some areas of St Elizabeth, they cannot communicate on either of the telecommunication providers. And so it has been difficult.",
            "They can do so through their local parish office or contact the ministry at 876-922-8000-9. They can also connect through the ministry's social media channels.",
            "This is the time when we want to see ODPEM Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management and the other State agencies showing themselves in the communities and delivering blankets, bedding, food items, water, and so on,\" Golding added.The Opposition leader claimed he was not looking to politicise the matter in any way, \"but where we see the gaps we want to call them out and bring them to the attention of the Government so that we can respond quickly to them. Right now people are hurting in many parts of Jamaica. The assessment needs to move rapidly so as to get relief to people. \"McKenzie argued, however, that while not perfect, the Government's plan worked well and vowed to \"use the lessons from this one to improve going forward.",
            "And I think that that is important because it is going to be difficult for you to plan in advance of a disaster. \"He added: \"But what we can look at is the systems that work. And if you ask me how much of the system worked, I would say, I would say, nine out of 10 of what we put in worked, so we will improve on that. And I believe also, what is going to be important is that we are going to be looking to expand our public education.",
            "It was not lacking, but I think the more we develop and encourage and educate will help us to improve in the areas. \"Minister with responsibility for information Senator Dr Dana Morris Dixon agreed that the Administration is always working to improve. \"And so we learn from every single situation that we have and we make it better. And remember, we went through COVID and we learned a lot through COVID and a lot of the mechanisms being put in place, in terms of relief, came out of the learnings of COVID.",
            "And so of course, with this one, we're going to learn even more and be better at it,\" she said.She noted however that one area the Government will have to look at is greater use of technology. \"One of the things that has hampered a lot of our work as Government has been the lack of communication and the coverage from our partners. And we are speaking, as you know, to telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow on that area. A lot of them were dependent on JPS Jamaica Public Service for electricity.",
            "\"Democracy is not in good health in today's world,\" he said at the time.Though he did not refer to any region specifically, Indonesian democracy certainly has been ailing in recent years, with the political establishment bulldozing popular opposition to controversial bills deemed to strengthen the power of oligarchs. The latter is due to not only the world's addiction to dirty energy, as evident in the massive use of fossil fuels and nonrenewable resources, but also injustice, unfair labor relations and the concentration of enormous wealth in a few hands.The Vatican has declared September as the \"Season of Creation\", when Pope Francis will call for protection of the Earth and solidarity with victims of environmental disasters and climate change.

            "While giving thanks that we were spared by the wrath of the hurricane, we have to remember those who lost in neighbouring islands who suffered great loss, including loss of lives. As a municipality, we extend our condolences to the families in these countries and wish them success in their restoration process. \"The mayor commended all who went above and beyond the call of duty. \"I say a big thank you, also, to the shelter managers and other community members who assisted with managing the shelters that were activated in the municipality.",
            "For them to leave their homes and families to take care of others demonstrated a deep sense of love and care for those in need. We must also thank the security forces, the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the Jamaica Constabulary Force and our own municipal officers as well as private security teams who were on hand to ensure the safety of all persons at various shelters. I must mention the JUTC representatives who were on hand at the command centre to assist with the transporting of persons to safety. Last, and by no means least, to my hard-working colleague councillors, my heartfelt gratitude to you for being in your respective divisions, assisting the residents and ensuring their safety.",

            "With all three branches putting demand on a container of generators, you can imagine that we may not be able to supply everybody's needs. We have ordered again for more to come in because the hurricane season is going to take us for the next five months,\" she added.Crichton said ATL may have to adjust, to meet changes in weather patterns. \"It tells us, as a business, that we actually have to have generators  more than one container  arriving in stock and dispatched to the various locations way ahead of time because, who to tell, maybe the season can be earlier next year,\" she theorised. \"June traditionally is the start but, based on what the indicators are with global warming or all the other activities that they're saying are contributing to all this abnormality, who says the hurricane season can't move up from May?",
            "We did not have much in stock. We sold 10 on Monday and 11 on Tuesday and that's it,\" Richie revealed.He said they are trying to get new stock from their suppliers in China but these will take approximately two months to reach Jamaica, and the price will not be the same as it was pre-Beryl. \"The price will definitely increase because of different variables such as the demand and the dollar,\" Richie insisted.However, ATL's Crichton is assuring the public that they will not burden customers with an unscheduled price increase during the hurricane season. \"ATL will not be increasing any prices, that's for sure, because we have to protect our customers; this is a time of our greatest need.",
            "It's the same principle we do for air conditioning units. In the summer, when the demand is greater, that's the time that we actually put all air conditioning units on sale. It will be the same for the generators,\" she said. \"We will not be increasing anything above what we would have normally priced this at.",
            "Our agency partners who usually attend these meetings as well as other stakeholders in attendance were asked to provide an update on their state of readiness,\" the mayor said.Also in attendance were representatives from the National Water Commission, Jamaica Public Service, National Works Agency, Social Development Commission, Jamaica Constabulary Force, Jamaica Fire Brigade, Kingston and St Andrew Public Health Department, Ministry of Labour and Social Security and Jamaica Red Cross. \"Councillors, you will agree that it is rare to see hurricanes develop so early in the season. This is in keeping with some of the predictions scientists have made regarding climate change and global warming. This underscores the need to always be prepared once we enter into the hurricane season."

I think one of the concerns that I have going forward is that while we are cleaning up, we don't completely cut down and eliminate trees,\" said Rodriguez-Moodie.",
            "\"Trees play an important role in keeping the environment cool and many other things in terms of purifying the air. \"After a hurricane, when we are trimming the trees that have been damaged, it's important to not just completely massacre and cut back a tree because when you do that, you can also affect the tree's ability to grow back properly,\" she said.The CEO further noted that the loss of trees means there are areas of land which are now open, making them prone to landslides and erosion, and further destruction of trees can worsen the situation. \"I think also when we're discarding, I want to caution people not to burn the tree branches because open burning is illegal and it can cause further issues. Other than the fact that you could potentially cause the fire to spread and damage other people's property, you could also cause health impacts as well in terms of air pollution,\" she warned.Touching on the topic of climate change and its impacts, the environmentalist said that while replanting trees must be a priority, it is important to plant the right trees.",
            "\"It's not about replanting with something like a palm tree or something like an ornamental bush because they don't play the same type of role in the environment. The trees are important in terms of keeping the environment cool and all the ecosystem services they provide, but not all trees are the same, and so we have to not be focusing on the easier fixes,\" said Rodriguez-Moodie. \"Trees are so important, especially as climate change worsens and the place is getting hotter and hotter. We need to be considering this,\" she stressed, adding that replanting also protects the topsoil and prevent issues such as landslides.",
