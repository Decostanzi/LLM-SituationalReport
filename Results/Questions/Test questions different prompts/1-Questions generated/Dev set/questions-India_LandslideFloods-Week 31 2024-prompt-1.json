            "title: Prime Minister Encourages Greater Awareness to Climate Change and Other Global Issues and Their Connection to Local Challenges  content: Prime Minister Encourages Greater Awareness to Climate Change and Other Global Issues and Their Connection to Local Challenges\"We must think globally, but act locally. \"\"Every Jamaican citizen must now pay attention to this thing called climate change. Pay attention to the frequency of major weather events happening in your country. Pay attention to the hotter times that you are experiencing on a daily basis.",
            "\"-Prime Minister HolnessThere is a direct link between climate change and many of the local challenges we are experiencing. That is the message from Prime Minister Andrew Holness. He is encouraging Jamaicans to pay closer attention to the far-reaching effects of climate change and act responsibly at the local level to lessen the impact of the issues we face.Speaking on the importance of responding to climate change, Prime Minister Holness implored Jamaicans to adopt a more global perspective in their daily lives. \"Many Jamaicans exist from day-to-day, and they have no clue about the global changes that are taking place around them.",
            "They only have to deal with the problems that they face daily. You cannot just be a local citizen. You are a citizen of the entire world, and there are some issues that affect the entire world that impact your local circumstances,\" Prime Minister Holness stated.The Prime Minister also noted the increasing frequency of major weather events in Jamaica and encouraged citizens to recognize the signs of climate change. \"Every Jamaican citizen must now pay attention to this thing called climate change.",
            "Pay attention to the frequency of major weather events happening in your country. Pay attention to the hotter times that you are experiencing on a daily basis. \"He continued: \"Almost every year for the last five years, Jamaica has had a serious weather event. Whether it is tropical storm Eta, tropical storm Zeta, or heavy floods.",
            "So not only are you going to have multiple crises, you're going to have them more frequently. \"The Prime Minister explained the interconnected nature of global and local issues, noting how climate change worsens health and other problems.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Holness also stressed the need for personal responsibility in tackling these challenges. He highlighted the issue of improper waste disposal and its impact on local communities, particularly in terms of vector-borne diseases. \"We cannot continue like this as a people.",
            "We have to take some responsibility. \"Furthermore, the Prime Minister called on Jamaicans to adopt better waste management practices to reduce the breeding of mosquitoes and other vectors. \"If you have to store water at home, cover water containers for your drinking and domestic purposes. We must understand that as the time gets hotter, the conditions for breeding mosquitoes and other vectors improve.",
            "Those conditions are what they like, and so you're going to get more mosquitoes. You cannot always blame the government and the National Solid Waste Management Authority; you have to take some personal responsibility. \"Prime Minister Holness is therefore appealing for behavioural change and increased awareness of global changes. \"I'm using this platform to appeal to all of Jamaica to understand that there are some global changes happening that you need to get in tune with and change your behaviour in order to have an impact on the conditions that these global changes create in your local community.",
            "The government is doing its part as much as it can from the economy that you create. Whatever resources we get, we allocate them to the problems as best as possible, and we are allocating them in smart ways. We are doing the things that build our resilience and our capabilities to respond to crises. \"The Prime Minister was speaking on Wednesday July 24 at the launch of the National Clean-up Program in Portmore, St. Catherine."

The committee's report highlighted the prolonged application of laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act AFSPA  described by Human Rights Watch as a \"tool of state abuse, oppression and discrimination\"  in \"disturbed areas\", leading to widespread and severe human rights violations, including excessive use of force resulting in unlawful killings, prolonged arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced displacement and torture.In addition, the UN panel has also urged India to take decisive action to end violence against minority groups in Kashmir and other occupied territories and to adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination laws. The report specifically addresses the issues faced by Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, scheduled castes and tribes, as well as other oppressed groups, emphasising the urgent need for action to address these concerns. The UN body has also noted that the Indian state is subjecting its own citizens to \"widespread and severe human rights violations, including excessive use of force resulting in unlawful killings, prolonged arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced displacement and torture\".The Human Rights Committee's recommendation to establish a mechanism to acknowledge responsibility and investigate human rights violations in Occupied Kashmir and other regions with separatist movements or unrest makes for a significant step towards ensuring accountability and justice for the affected population, but as history has shown, India has zero interest in taking criticism from renowned human rights activists and groups, instead accusing them of meddling in \"India's internal matters\".",

Two UNCIP resolutions, dated August 13, 1948, and January 5, 1949, clearly laid down the criteria for the conduct of a plebiscite in the State for the ultimate grant of the right of self-determination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. The right of self-determination holds a key position in the UN Charter as a foundation for every human being. The essence of the right of self-determination is that every nation and community has the right to freely decide its future as per the wishes of its masses without any discrimination, restriction and bondage.",
            "If this right is applicable to the entire international community, Kashmiris cannot and should not be made an exception and subjugated through foreign occupation indefinitely. India recognized and accepted the right of self-determination to Kashmiris as per abovementioned UNCIP resolutions yet denied its implementation for over seven decades.The persistent Indian denial of a political solution to the Kashmir dispute created frustration and unrest among the people of Jammu and Kashmir. The frustration of Kashmiris was the result of years of Indian occupation, discrimination of Kashmiris in their own state, maltreatment of Kashmiris and denial of internal autonomy to the State, agreed through Article 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution. Resultantly, the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir IIOJK revolted against the unlawful Indian rule and its unremitting exploitative policies in 1990.",
            "The popular slogan of Azadi' right of self-determination was the only demand of Kashmiri masses of IIOJK right from the beginning of this indigenous Kashmiri movement.Through a brutal response to this UN mandated legal demand of Kashmiris of IIOJK, India made massive deployment of Army and paramilitary forces in entire IIOJK and started persecution of Kashmiris through various inhuman strategies. Mass arrests, torture in detention centres, custodial killings and indiscriminate firings over the peaceful Kashmiri demonstrations became the order of the day in IIOJK right from the start of 1990. As per estimates collected through various neutral sources, Indian brutal security forces have killed over 100,000 Kashmiris in IIOJK since 1990. Kashmiri leadership in IIOJK has frequently been targeted and killed either through direct attack or else while being in custody and house arrest under Indian security forces.",
            "The great Kashmir leader, Syed Ali Shah Gillani, the founding father of Kashmiris resistance movement died in September 2021 while being under house arrest for over five years.As per records maintained by names, dates and places of occurrences, over 12,000 Kashmiri women have been subjected to rape and molestation, including gang rape and killing of women after rape. The Indian state provided blanket coverage for these inhuman acts through various laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act AFSPA, Public Safety Act PSA, Geospatial Information Regulation Act and National Investigation Agency NIA. These discriminatory laws granted the Indian Army and its paramilitary forces special provisions for arrest, illegal detention, torture and killing of Kashmiris with impunity. Such laws and the maltreatment of Kashmiris through the use of brutal force are internationally challengeable violations of international law, humanitarian declarations, covenants and dozens of international pacts.While India continued massive human rights violations in IIOJK through the deployment of its over 900,000 security forces, it ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir State illegally and unilaterally on August 5, 2019 by abrogating Article 370 and 35-A of its constitution.",
            "Besides, it also ended the statehood of the state by creating two union territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh under the Indian Union. In order to further its agenda of consolidation of its hold over the state, New Delhi introduced new Domicile Laws for Jammu and Kashmir in April 2020 adaptation of State laws order-2020.Under these laws, India has issued millions of domicile certificates to non-Kashmiri Hindus from various parts of India which is a grave violation of Fourth Geneva Convention. Article 496 of Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits occupying powers to transfer its own population into the occupied territory. Indeed, this is yet another aspect, covered under the blatant human rights violation.The unremitting account of massive human rights violations of Indian security forces in IIOJK over the last three decades has added a humanitarian dimension to the prevailing political nature of Kashmir dispute.",
            "The humanitarian dimension of the dispute needs immediate attention of the international community and United Nations Organization. On January 18, 2022, A UK based law firm filed an appeal to the London's Metropolitan Police for the arrest of the then Indian Army Chief General Manoj and Indian Home Minister Amit Shah for undertaking massive human rights violations of Kashmiris in IIOJK. This legal appeal for the arrest of two top Indian government officials was lodged under the \"Universal Jurisdiction\". Indeed, Indian Army and its paramilitary forces have been undertaking massive human rights violation in IIOJK since 1990 through; direct killings, torture, kidnapping, extrajudicial killings as well as rape and sexual violence.With over 900,000 Indian forces deployed, IIOJK has become a war zone.",
            "Therefore, besides the political settlement of the dispute, International humanitarian law IHL provides solid bases to resolve the dispute on a humanitarian basis. IHL is indeed a set of rules that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict in the war zone like IIOJK. Besides UNO, IHL lays out the responsibilities of states to protect the local population from all dimensions: their basic civil rights, their freedom and security and, above all, their right to self-determination. The Kashmir dispute needs to be addressed on the basis of IHL.",
            "UN and major powers must constrain India to end its massive human rights violations in IIOJK which should also include stoppage of the demographic changes and massive human rights violations. The writer is Professor of Politics and IR at International Islamic University, Islamabad."

Caritas India is working closely with local diocesan organizations in Wayanad to assess the needs of the affected communities and plan both short-term relief support and long-term livelihood restoration and rehabilitation.Caritas representatives have been actively visiting relief camps, engaging with authorities and inmates to assess ongoing needs. This grassroots approach enables the organization to adapt its interventions and provide targeted assistance, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations receive the help they require.As a follow-up, Caritas India Associate Director Fr Antony Fernandes will be visiting the affected areas on August 3, 2024, to further assess the situation and coordinate relief efforts. Additionally, Caritas India Executive Director Fr.",

Caritas India is already on-site, coordinating with its local partners WSSS, Shreyas, and Jeevana to provide immediate relief support and trauma counseling to the affected communities.Immediate Needs and Ongoing ChallengesAs rescue operations continue, the situation remains critical, with ongoing rain hampering efforts. The India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in Kerala for the next 24 hours, which could further affect the rescue operations. The scale of the disaster is immense, with hundreds still trapped under debris, and officials warn that the death toll could double.Caritas India is committed to standing with the people of Wayanad during this difficult time and will continue to work tirelessly to provide the necessary support and assistance to the affected communities.",

            "title: Fatwa and Gwadar incident  content: THE situation in Pakistan is deeply troubling as the incompetence of politicians and civil administration has forced the army into handling sensitive ethnic, religious, cultural, and social conflicts, areas outside its training and primary purpose. The army is primarily trained to combat foreign enemies and assist the civilian government only when law and order are beyond civilian control. For example, during the Paris Olympics, over 10,000 military personnel provided security but returned to barracks after the event. In Pakistan, however, due to the persistent failures of political and civil leaders, the army is repeatedly called upon to manage conflicts that should be the civilian government's responsibility.During my over four decades of experience, I have frequently interacted with the Army Command when they were called to assist civilians.",
            "The army consistently argued that they should only be called upon in extreme circumstances. They emphasized that their military-grade weapons are unsuitable for use against their own citizens, which limits their effectiveness to that of the civilian government. While their presence and flag marches may initially intimidate the populace, this effect diminishes as people grow accustomed to the army's involvement in civilian matters.The involvement of the army in civilian affairs, driven by the incompetence of politicians and the civil administration, has severely damaged its image. Visible and virulent movements against the army have emerged in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KP.",
            "The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement PTM in KP advocates for the rights of the Pashtun people, aiming to end extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and unlawful detentions, while demanding justice and human rights. In Balochistan, groups like the Baloch Liberation Army BLA, Baloch Republican Army BRA, Baloch Liberation Front BLF, and United Baloch Army UBA engage in armed struggle and propaganda against the army, further complicating the situation. This standoff has led to numerous incidents of violence, including the recent clash in Gwadar where a protest by the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee turned violent, resulting in the death of one soldier and injuries to 16 others. The loss of life, whether of a protester or a soldier, is deeply painful for every Pakistani patriot, underscoring the urgent need for competent governance and peaceful resolution of conflicts.Like violent movements that should have no place in a democratic country, another deeply worrying phenomenon reflecting a serious fault line in our national fabric is the issuance of fatwas calling for the death of anyone contradicting the fatwa giver's religious philosophy.",
            "There has been a history of such illegal fatwas in Pakistan. In 2012, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan issued a fatwa against Malala Yousafzai for advocating girls' education, leading to an assassination attempt. In 2011, a fatwa was issued against Salman Taseer for criticizing blasphemy laws, resulting in his assassination. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy faced fatwas in 2016 for her documentary on honour killings.",
            "Militant groups like TTP issued fatwas against polio vaccinations, claiming they were a Western conspiracy, leading to attacks on health workers. The 1974 fatwa against Ahmadis declared them non-Muslims, resulting in severe persecution. The Women's Protection Bill in 2006 faced fatwas for attempting to protect women from domestic violence. Javed Ahmad Ghamidi faced threats and was forced to leave Pakistan in 2005 due to his progressive views.",
            "Judges involved in the 2018 acquittal of Asia Bibi faced death fatwas from extremist groups, and those who delivered the 2019 Faizabad Dharna verdict were similarly targeted. The latest incident involves a fatwa against Supreme Court Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa.The Pakistan Army faces a two-pronged jeopardy, despite the unwavering dedication of its brave soldiers and officers who frequently embrace shahadat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to protect the country and its people from terrorists, criminals, and extremists. Instead of receiving the praise they rightly deserve, a virulent propaganda campaign has been unleashed against the army on social media and traditional media platforms. While this propaganda has failed to deter the armed forces from achieving their objectives, it negatively impacts overall morale.",
            "Therefore, it is imperative to address and reverse this situation promptly. In this context, the parliament should prioritize addressing the underlying fault lines within the country instead of wasting time on self-serving laws to protect itself from the judiciary or opposition parties. The parliament must investigate and understand the real reasons and factors that have transformed a large segment of society into separatist, insurgent, extremists, religious bigots, and intolerant individuals. These elements take pride in waging armed struggle against the army, burning religious symbols of minorities, lynching individuals accused of blasphemy, slaughtering those opposed to their religious views, and issuing fatwas to murder others without judicial process, all with impunity.Interestingly, the district administration, special branch, and other intelligence agencies monitor all gatherings as a standard operating procedure, compiling daily reports at the district, divisional, provincial, and national levels, which ultimately reach the Prime Minister's desk every morning.",
            "Ironically, neither the Prime Minister, the parliament, nor our so-called intellectual thinkers and philosophers have taken up the challenge to reverse the ever-increasing phenomena of separatism, extremism, bigotry, intolerance, and violent behavior. Due to this impunity, these elements have become emboldened to the point of issuing fatwas against high-ranking officials, including the army chief, the prime minister, judges, and now the chief justice.As a nation, we must insulate our army from civilian affairs. Politicians and civil administration should step forward boldly to handle all internal political conflicts, such as the PTM and Baloch insurgency, taking full responsibility for their success and failure. Moreover, civilian leadership must recognize that fatwas, especially those that incite violence or are criminal in nature, including those related to incitement to violence, hate speech, and terrorism, have no official legal status.",

            "The only thing that holds it together is vegetation,\" said TV Sajeev, the chief scientist of KFRI.But in recent years, the Kerala government has allowed certain non-plantation activities in this region. \"As a result, plantation owners have shifted to tourism and built mega structures for which the ground had to be levelled, making it even more fragile,\" Mr Sajeev added.The scientist says the government should go back to the Gadgil report that said fragile land must be managed in a different way. \"The way out is to make sure that our ecological systems are really healthy. If they are healthy, they can handle any kind of climate change,\" he said.",
            "\"The landslides were mostly on the upper slopes of hills which then cascaded to the valley below, M R Ajith Kumar, a top state police officer, told Reuters. \"Focus right now is to search the entire uphill area for stranded people and recover as many bodies as possible,\" he said.Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who until recently represented Wayanad in parliament, said he had been unable to go through with a planned visit to the disaster. \"Due to incessant rains and adverse weather conditions we have been informed by authorities that we will not be able to land,\" he said in a post on social media platform X. \"The Arabian Sea is warming at a higher rate compared to other regions and sending more evaporation into the atmosphere, making the region a hotspot for deep convective clouds,\" said S Abhilash, head of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research at Kerala's Cochin University of Science and Technology.",

            "\"Climate change is drastically altering rainfall patterns in the region,\" said Dr Akshay Deoras, a researcher at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. \"What was once a predictable monsoon season has become increasingly erratic, with long dry spells followed by sudden, intense downpours. \"This shift heightens the risk of floods and makes landslides more likely as dry soils are unable to absorb heavy rains effectively, he explained.The rainfall is also not distributed equally. While rainfall in Kerala's nothern Kannur district was 21 per cent above average between 1 June and 30 July, it was 14 per cent below average in neighbouring Wayanad and nearly 25 per cent below average in Idukki and Ernakulam.",
            "\"The co-occurence of two extreme scenarios, landslides and rainfall deficit, in the same state reflects a strong spatial variability in this year's monsoon rainfall,\" Dr Deoras said. \"The expectation is that such a pattern would become more intense in the future if global warming continues. \"Kerala was devastated by Cyclone Ockhi in 2017 and again by massive floods in 2018, among the worst in its history.What Dr Deoras described isn't unique to Kerala. \"We see roads being constructed and widened without proper measures such as slope stability, retaining walls, or adequate drainage systems,\" said professor YP Sundriyal, head of geology at the HNB Garhwal University.",
            "\"Such infrastructure projects, carried out without considering the region's geological sensitivity, can exacerbate the risk of landslides. \"Kerala has witnessed a construction boom in the last few decades, driven by rapid urbanisation and a growing population, that has often ignored ecological considerations. Buildings have been erected in areas prone to floods and landslides, with insufficient regard for safety regulations. The result is a landscape where natural disasters can have disproportionately severe consequences.One of the most vital components of disaster management is the implementation of effective early warning systems.",
            "While Kerala has made strides in this area, significant gaps remain. Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, emphasized the need for localised early warning systems. \"Landslide-prone areas are mapped and known, yet timely evacuation and preventive measures are often lacking,\" he said. \"We need to monitor rainfall data in these hotspots and prepare targeted early warning systems to save lives and livelihoods.",
            "\"None of the agencies had issued a red alert for Wayanad ahead of the July 30 landslides,\" it said.If disasters like this are to be avoided, experts said, urgent mitigation measures need to be implemented. \"Kerala has not been witnessing typical monsoon rains and has been struggling to achieve its average rainfall,\" said Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet Weather. \"Despite these heavy showers, it is yet to surpass its average rainfall so far. The rise in air and ocean temperatures has led to a drastic increase in moisture, making the atmosphere unstable.",
            "\"This instability underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy involving both mitigation and adaptation measures. \"Several measures can be taken to mitigate the impact of landslides and excessive rains linked to climate change,\" Mr Palawat said. \"Implementing robust early warning systems through enhanced weather forecasting technologies can provide timely alerts, enabling residents to evacuate and prepare.\""

The soil remains highly unstable, with visible cracks indicating imminent threats to lives and properties. Ongoing geo-seismic activities in the vicinity exacerbate the risk, as the land continues to shift. The landslide covered two creeks with debris and boulders, blocking waterways and increasing the likelihood of further slides.",
            "The blockage of these creeks poses a critical risk of flooding, which could trigger additional landslides, endangering the already vulnerable community.The International Organization for Migration IOM, in collaboration with the Enga Provincial Disaster Response Team and Site Management team, conducted a Displacement Tracking Matrix DTM assessment across all affected wards Yambali, Pokolip, Kuandak, and Yuyango between June-July 2024. This assessment was carried out by enumerators through field observations, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews with both affected populations and local authorities and as well critical sectoral needs were identified. The assessment also highlighted ongoing risks of displacement in high-risk areas prone to further landslides and environmental hazards. The findings presented in this DTM report emphasize the urgent need for targeted humanitarian assistance to meet these evolving needs and mitigate risks effectively.",

            "title: Satellite imagery, machine learning to map flooding in urban areas  content: New model uses satellite imagery, machine learning to map flooding in urban environmentsAs climate change causes storms to intensify, new tools are needed to map where flooding occurs in under-studied areas.A new mapping tool from North Carolina State University uses machine learning and open-source satellite imagery to model flooding in urban environments. The new model could create maps that predict urban area flooding, which traditionally have not been accessible to urban planners. This could help identify potentially flood-prone areas in urban settings, helping officials make better-informed choices about where to allocate flood resiliency and prevention resources.Rebecca Composto, a graduate student at NC State and lead author of a paper describing the model, said that urban areas present unique challenges in collecting satellite data and tracking the flow of water. \"One of the first issues is building shadows.",
            "Taller buildings create more shadows, which means that the satellite imagery appears darker and carries less information,\" she said. \"Urban areas also have more complex hydrology, as the existence of so many drainage systems along with concrete surfaces that don't soak up water means that it's harder to predict where water accumulates. \"Flooding in urban areas also tends to both start and end quickly, sometimes too quickly for satellites to gather enough usable data. Flooding from Ida lasted longer than usual in areas like Philadelphia, and this combined with a sudden break in cloud cover gave Composto just the kind of satellite data she needed.The next step was to train a machine-learning model to recognize and map flooding.",
            "To create sufficient training data for the model to recognize urban flooding, Composto spent months hand-drawing polygons onto her satellite imagery to help the program understand what it was looking at. These polygons helped the machine-learning algorithm \"see\" the characteristics of satellite imagery most aligned with flooding and then map the flooding.Composto then compared the resulting map, known as a flood extent, to Federal Emergency Management Agency flood zones. These zones designate areas depending on how likely they are to flood - for example, a \"500-year\" flood zone has an approximately 1-in-500 chance of flooding each year. Other areas are deemed \"minimal flood hazard,\" which places them outside the limit of the 500-year flood designation.The model found that more flooding was occurring in these minimal hazard areas than in the 500-year zones.",
            "Composto said that this was likely due to the much larger size of the minimal hazard zones - despite having more flooding by volume, the risk of flooding in these areas was still proportionally smaller than in the 500-year zones.Further research might focus on simplifying the model for ease of use. Composto plans to integrate a new map displaying flood depth and make her code open source to make it easier to share with emergency-response leaders.",
