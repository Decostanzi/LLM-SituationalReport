Our work with ASEAN spans more than two decades and we've celebrated numerous successes with the AHA Centre since it was first initiated as a regional hub for disaster risk reduction nearly fifteen years ago.Through our collaboration with experts at the AHA Centre, the first regional multi-hazard early warning and risk intelligence platform known as the Disaster Monitoring and Response System, or DMRS, was launched in 2012 to serve all ASEAN Member States. Today, DMRS provides near-real-time impact analysis advanced analytics, insights, and actionable information, for a multitude of hazards, empowering decision-makers to understand risks and quickly mobilize life-saving humanitarian resources.",

PDC and the AHA Centre have since collaborated on disaster risk assessments and exercise engagements over the years, including ARDEX, ADMM-Plus, and national-level exercises and have continuously enhanced DMRS to bolster the readiness and resilience of Member States. \"The AHA Centre is mandated to facilitate the coordination of disaster management among ASEAN Member States, providing early warning and impact analysis through DMRS, as well as training and capacity development. The work we've done with PDC over the years to enhance DMRS, as well as their expertise in risk assessment and predictive analytics has been integral to our operations and to the overall disaster risk reduction objectives of the region.\"",
