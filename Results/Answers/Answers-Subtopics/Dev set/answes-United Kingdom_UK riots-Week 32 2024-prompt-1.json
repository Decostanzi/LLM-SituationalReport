These protests were often planned organically by local people who are connected to decentralized far-right networks online [2]. Modern technology, particularly social media, enables individuals to collaborate towards common political goals independently of traditional organizational structures [2]. Social media posts claiming action in many locations appeared to instigate these events [3]. Following a stabbing in Southport, a broadcast channel titled 'Southport Wake Up' was set up on the messaging app Telegram [9]. The far-right now uses interlinked networks and Telegram chats to move seamlessly between groups, driving these protests [9]. Nigel Farage's manipulation of social media also contributes to the merging of different far-right elements [6]. The spread of misinformation online is a factor that needs to be examined [11].\n\nThis mobilization has challenged Britain's peaceful multi-ethnic identity [1]. Ineffective legislation permits pernicious racist narratives to be freely propagated, especially on social media, which needs to be addressed in extremism laws [5]. The mainstreaming of far-right discourse on immigration is a political fact requiring a response to defend Britain's multicultural society [5]. By adopting far-right rhetoric, politicians have normalized Islamophobia and xenophobia, emboldening extremists [10]. This has led to a divided country where the far right is a real and present danger [10]. Misinformation about how the state handles unrest risks stoking further tensions [11]. There is a need for a more serious approach to integration, social cohesion, and counter-extremism, as these issues have been neglected [12]. Building a resilient multi-ethnic society requires concerted work on societal cohesion and greater responsibility and accuracy from journalists and politicians when discussing immigration, asylum seekers, and the Muslim community [15].", "retrieved_contexts": ["In Southport and places such as Sunderland and Stoke, hundreds of rioters, mobilised through social media, brought the spirit of the far-right pogrom to the streets of our towns and cities. In Middlesbrough, masked youths targeted an area with a large immigrant population, smashing the windows of houses and car windscreens. These actions were a challenge to Britain's peaceful multi-ethnic identity.As Dame Sara Khan, the independent adviser for social cohesion and resilience under Rishi Sunak, told this newspaper, that did not come about in a political vacuum. According to Ms Khan's own research, the inflammatory rhetoric deployed by successive Conservative governments in relation to immigration has palpably nourished extremism on the ground.", "Remarkably, things escalated further as the weekend began, with far-right \"demonstrations\" descending into racist attacks, rioting and looting in Liverpool, Hull, Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday. Some initially misattributed the disturbances to the English Defence League EDL  an outfit that ceased operating years ago  but this wave of demonstrations reflects the increasingly decentralised nature of the current far right. While activists affiliated with traditional far-right organisations have been involved, most of these protests were planned organically, often by local people, who are plugged into decentralised far-right networks online.The shared slogans, language and iconography don't show that these rioters form a cohesive or coordinated group; rather, it means that their organisers and attenders are often active in overlapping online spaces. Though not centrally organised, the participants are drawing from a common wellspring of anger and often recycle the same slogans  in particular \"enough is enough\", \"stop the boats\" and \"save our children\".Modern technology, and social media in particular, enables individuals to collaborate towards common political goals independent of traditional organisational structures.", "It also leaves Labour with a task that goes far beyond the rapid administering of criminal justice in the courts.As Ms Khan argues, ineffective legislation permits pernicious racist narratives to be freely propagated, particularly on social media. This lacuna in our extremism laws must finally be addressed. Just as importantly, the mainstreaming and normalisation of far-right discourse on immigration in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, is a political fact that requires a response. The reality of Britain as a multicultural society needs to be defended and celebrated, both rhetorically and through the provision of real resources and support to challenged areas.As has been said many times in the aftermath of Southport, the overwhelming majority of Britons will view the events of the past few days with utter revulsion.", "\"Experts warned anticipating which demonstrations will gain momentum is hard to predict after more than a week of clashes in the wake of the stabbing of three children in Southport appeared to erupt \"organically\".Following the killings last Monday, a broadcast channel on messaging app Telegram was set up, titled Southport Wake Up'. \"The far right has moved away from the party or membership group as the main organisational form and what's driving these protests is a far right interlinked network who can move quite seamlessly from one group to another through Telegram chats,\" a spokesman told The Independent. \"I think that's the nature of it now. The organised far right are less involved in this than they are so far being credited for.", "\"You just see extremists co-opting that,\" she notes. \"You see people saying, well, if politicians can use that language, why can't we?\" Nigel Farage's insidious manipulation of social media is further contributing to this merging of horizons between Reform, parts of a radicalised Conservative party and the extra-parliamentary far right.Thankfully, the likes of Suella Braverman, who as home secretary described irregular migration as an \"invasion\" and later suggested that \"Islamists\" were now running Britain, will not be in office anytime soon. But the pious condemnation of the violence by senior Conservative figures sits uneasily with their party's relentless framing of immigration as a menace to the nation.", "title: The Observer view on the UK riots: political neglect lies behind our fractured communities  content: Last Wednesday, businesses closed early and shops boarded up in anticipation of an outbreak of far-right violence in some parts of the country. Six thousand trained police officers were on standby to respond. In the end, it did not materialise on anything like the scale feared: relatively few agitators were dwarfed by huge crowds of anti-racist demonstrators sending a message that the far-right were not welcome in their communities.That was a huge relief, but, as the prime minister warned on Friday, there is no room for complacency. With hindsight, the social media posts that claimed there would be action in many locations looked more like an attempt to instigate it than a sign of networked organisation.", "Anti-racists were at the forefront.What we learned last night and what we told the world was that the rightwing media, the GB News presenters and the Telegraph hysterics, for all their foghorn power, do not represent a country that just elected a social democratic government with a huge majority. That bodes well.Still, riots do have effects. Watch now as everyone tries to interpret what has happened to their own political advantage.

Wanting to tackle dangerous Channel crossings is not \"far right\", nor is wanting an immigration policy which finds the right balance between compassion and control, nor is supporting Brexit. We shouldn't pretend that far-right thugs need excuses in the form of Home Office policy to perpetrate their acts of violence.Instead, what needs to happen now begins with restoring law and order. Instead, we need to have a more serious approach to integration, social cohesion, and counterextremism.For too long we have neglected these issues, with cohesion policy reduced to hoping everyone will be nice to each other.", "By adopting the rhetoric of the far right, politicians have sanitized and mainstreamed Islamophobia and xenophobia, emboldening extremists. The willingness, indeed eagerness, of some media to vilify and demonize certain communities and groups has also made this possible. When the government conducts a postmortem of the riots, it should not ignore the role politicians and media played in stoking fear, mistrust, and hostility towards these groups.The new Labour government inherits a country divided, in which the far right is a real and present danger.
