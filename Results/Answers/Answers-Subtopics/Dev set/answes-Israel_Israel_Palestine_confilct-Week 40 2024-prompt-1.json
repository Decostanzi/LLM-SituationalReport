The lack of proper burial facilities for the high number of casualties has led to unconventional and often unsanitary disposal of human remains.

The overcrowded living conditions in temporary shelters, combined with limited access to clean water, sanitation facilities and hygiene products, have resulted in rapid spread of skin and other infectious diseases.Pollutants released from destroyed infrastructure, including potentially toxic substances from damaged industrial facilities, can have lasting impacts on human health. Children, in particular, are vulnerable to the effects of environmental toxins, which can impair cognitive development and lead to chronic health issues.The environmental crisis also has significant social and economic implications.
