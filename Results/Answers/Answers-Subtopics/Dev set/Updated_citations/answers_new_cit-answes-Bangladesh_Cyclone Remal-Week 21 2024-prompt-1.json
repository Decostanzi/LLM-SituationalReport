Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar are vulnerable to extreme weather events, with urgent climate mitigation and disaster preparedness measures needed to mitigate risks such as cyclones and landslides. Displaced populations like the Rohingya are particularly susceptible to secondary displacement due to settling in hazard-prone areas, exacerbating the risk of climate-related movement on a larger scale. The combination of food insecurity, violence, lack of livelihoods, and dwindling hope for durable solutions has led to a surge in irregular maritime movement of Rohingya across the region in recent months.Though conflict remains the primary driver of Rohingya displacement, climate and environmental factors along with the deteriorating conditions in the camps significantly exacerbates migration risks, particularly during perilous sea journeys.",

    "retrieved_answer": "The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has taken several measures in response to Cyclone Remal. According to the BMD, a depression in the Bay of Bengal was likely to intensify into a severe cyclone named REMAL and make landfall between Kolkata, India, and Patuakhali, Bangladesh, from May 26 midnight to May 27 early morning 2024 [1][5]. The BMD issued Danger Signal 10 for the coastal districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, and their offshore islands and chars [1][5]. Bangladesh Meteorological Department Director Azizur Rahman also reported that the severe Cyclone Remal had started crossing the Bangladesh coast and could continue hammering the coast until at least the early hours of Monday morning [4][6]. He stated that maximum wind speeds of 90 kilometers per hour had been recorded, with the possibility of picking up more pace [4][6].\n\nThe expected impacts on the coastal districts include maximum wind speeds hitting 100-110 km/h during high impact time [1][5], with some forecasts indicating winds reaching 110-120 kilometers per hour and gusts up to 135 kilometers per hour [2][7]. Heavy rainfall is forecast, with a possible risk of floods, flash floods, and landslides [1][5]. The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four meters) above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous [4], or 8-12 feet above normal tide [12]. Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are low-lying, making them vulnerable to devastation by high storm surges [4]. The low-lying areas of coastal districts such as Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barishal, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Chattogram, and Cox's Bazar, along with their offshore islands and chars, face a critical threat of inundation [12][13][14][16]. These areas are likely to be inundated by a wind-driven surge of 3-5 feet height of water above normal astronomical tide [13][16]. The storm is expected to bring heavy to very heavy rainfall and strong winds to these coastal areas [12][14].",

      "Yemen faces a dire situation, with over 80 percent of the targeted people having no access to proper water and sanitation facilities. In Nigeria, only 2 percent of the women in need of essential sexual and reproductive health services and gender-based violence prevention received it in 2023, leaving them vulnerable to severe health risks and increased violence. These examples underscore the urgent need for consistent and sufficient funding to support global humanitarian efforts. Without adequate resources, the ability to deliver life-saving aid and essential services to those in crisis is severely challenged, perpetuating cycles of suffering and worsening existing emergencies.",
      "Regrettably, a quick resolution to this funding crisis remains elusive.Each year, the United Nations appeals to its member states for funds to respond to global crises and provide lifesaving assistance, including food, sanitation, healthcare, and shelter. In 2023, approximately 128 million people received lifesaving assistance. However, due to funding shortages, humanitarian organisations fell short of reaching their target, assisting less than two-thirds of the people they aimed to support. Response plans for 2024 are ultra-prioritised, with extremely tightened budgets to address the most urgent needs.",
      "As the funding gap widens, the focus should be on ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches those in need efficiently. This approach maximises the impact of assistance while maintaining accountability to affected populations. Donors should enhance the effectiveness of their support by offering more flexible funding mechanisms that allow implementing partners to respond rapidly to evolving needs on the ground. This may involve committing to multi-year funding and reducing restrictions on fund allocation.",
      "title: Humanitarian funding: A crisis within a crisis  content: Every morning, I wake up with a sense of dread as my email is already flooded with requests from different stakeholdersgovernment authorities and humanitarian aid partners  seeking assistance for displaced populations. The stark reality of dwindling global humanitarian funds breeds this dread. If you ask humanitarians how things are going these days, they, too, will tell you they are facing a serious problem: a funding shortfall. There are too many ongoing crises around the world with insufficient funds to help those in need.",
      "This funding shortfall is causing a crisis within a crisis.Conflicts, climate emergencies and collapsing economies are wreaking havoc in communities around the world, resulting in catastrophic hunger, massive displacement and disease outbreaks.

      "As the funding gap widens, the focus should be on ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches those in need efficiently. This approach maximises the impact of assistance while maintaining accountability to affected populations. Donors should enhance the effectiveness of their support by offering more flexible funding mechanisms that allow implementing partners to respond rapidly to evolving needs on the ground. This may involve committing to multi-year funding and reducing restrictions on fund allocation.",
      "Cash assistance was distributed through digital transfers to vulnerable households before the cyclone hits. This enables them to prepare by purchasing essential supplies such as dry food, medicines, food for infants, and cattle feed. Additionally, they can secure their homes by purchasing ropes and other necessary items and arrange for boats or alternative transportation for evacuation, ensuring their safety and resilience in preparation for the impending cyclone. Actions also involve disseminating early warning messages and coordinating with the CPP and local government to evacuate at-risk communities.",

Localisation is key in this approach, as emphasised in the Grand Bargain, an agreement on humanitarian reformed that was agreed on in the World Humanitarian Summit 2016, that 48 countries and aid agencies are party to. It is essential that we collaborate closely with local actors, ensuring that our efforts empower them rather than replace them.

      "This funding shortfall is causing a crisis within a crisis.Conflicts, climate emergencies and collapsing economies are wreaking havoc in communities around the world, resulting in catastrophic hunger, massive displacement and disease outbreaks. If the current trends in displacement due to protracted complex conflicts with a high risk of relapse, urbanised conflict, and growing inequality continue, the gap between needs and response will continue to widen.This underlines the urgent need for more proactive and innovative responses.

Therefore, it is crucial that we harness and redesign the way we do business.",
      "To initiate this transformation, we must set forth an ambitious agenda and timeline for a total change. The starting point is a fundamental shift away from crisis response towards crisis prevention, focusing on reducing vulnerabilities and addressing the root causes of displacement.We need to move beyond institutional silos to materialise the ambition.

This includes people living in better buildings[17]and upholding strict building standards[16].\n*   **Access to Basic Resources** Providing access to electricity and clean water[12], and air conditioning or heating to protect from extreme temperatures[12][18].\n*   **Early Warning Systems** Increasing the coverage of early warning systems helps reduce exposure[17]. Better weather prediction and early warning systems allow people to evacuate before a hazard hits[17]. Accurate forecasts and useful early warnings require data from all countries in a region to be brought together and fed into weather models[20].\n*   **Agricultural Productivity** Making agriculture more productive is vital[16], as more productive agricultural systems can recover from damaging events[17].\n*   **Financial Resilience** Ensuring households have enough money to absorb shocks in energy or food prices and resources to recover after a disaster[12].\n*   **Strong Governance and Support** Building strong political governance is vital[16]. Political systems should allow for national and international support before or after a hazard strikes[18]. Populations pushing for political rights and accountability also contribute[19].\n*   **Human Capital Development** Disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies can impact human capital investment, including providing schooling opportunities for households constrained by subsistence consumption[11]."

An increase in any of these dimensions increases the risk, while a reduction lowers it.This is why you might hear the phrase, \"There's no such thing as a natural disaster\". Hazards only become disasters when they impact societies and people.",
      "A hurricane, for example, is not a disaster until it hurts or kills people or destroys homes in its path.How does this framework explain the dramatic decline in deaths from disasters over the last century?The hazard component has not declined. It has probably increased - on several dimensions - because of climate change.4Exposure has not declined either. There are more than four times as many people on the planet than a century ago. People have migrated to cities, often along coastlines, where events such as storm surges, cyclones, and flooding are more likely.",
      "It's often the poorest who are most vulnerable to disasters. Having an earthquake-proof home, access to electricity and clean water, air conditioning or heating, enough money to absorb shocks in energy or food prices, and resources to recover after a disaster means you can protect yourself.
