      "For them to leave their homes and families to take care of others demonstrated a deep sense of love and care for those in need. We must also thank the security forces, the Jamaica Fire Brigade, the Jamaica Constabulary Force and our own municipal officers as well as private security teams who were on hand to ensure the safety of all persons at various shelters. I must mention the JUTC representatives who were on hand at the command centre to assist with the transporting of persons to safety. Last, and by no means least, to my hard-working colleague councillors, my heartfelt gratitude to you for being in your respective divisions, assisting the residents and ensuring their safety.",

Right now people are hurting in many parts of Jamaica. The assessment needs to move rapidly so as to get relief to people. \"McKenzie argued, however, that while not perfect, the Government's plan worked well and vowed to \"use the lessons from this one to improve going forward.",
      "And so of course, with this one, we're going to learn even more and be better at it,\" she said.She noted however that one area the Government will have to look at is greater use of technology. \"One of the things that has hampered a lot of our work as Government has been the lack of communication and the coverage from our partners. And we are speaking, as you know, to telecommunications providers Digicel and Flow on that area. A lot of them were dependent on JPS Jamaica Public Service for electricity.",
      "While giving thanks that we were spared by the wrath of the hurricane, we have to remember those who lost in neighbouring islands who suffered great loss, including loss of lives. As a municipality, we extend our condolences to the families in these countries and wish them success in their restoration process. \"The mayor commended all who went above and beyond the call of duty. \"I say a big thank you, also, to the shelter managers and other community members who assisted with managing the shelters that were activated in the municipality.",
      "The hardest-hit constituencies will get an extra 3 million. The additional 4 million will be focused largely on helping persons replace their roofing.Holness cautioned Members of Parliament that \"everyone who receives a benefit must sign for it. He lauded the teams, both in the public and private sectors, for working around the clock to bring services back online, even while acknowledging that much work was left to be done.",
      "\"This is a significant step in our efforts to support the communities in need especially with the response time that we did. The dedication displayed by our team is truly commendable, ensuring that vital resources reach those who need them most. We remain committed to making a meaningful impact in the lives of others,\" said Martinez.In the meantime, social impact specialist at the company Jerome Cowans expressed pride in being a part of an organisation that displays compassion for its communities. \"It's inspiring to witness first-hand the positive change that Carib Cement is making in the people's lives, and I look forward to continuing our social impact mission,\" said Cowans.In response to the company's efforts, pastor of the Denbigh Church of the Nazarene Carlton Bryan said that the community was grateful for CCCL's support."

    "retrieved_answer": "To address the significant damage to livelihood infrastructure in the southern region of Jamaica following Hurricane Beryl, several measures are being implemented:\n\n*   **Damage Assessment and Recovery Planning:** The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is deployed in affected areas of the Caribbean, including Jamaica, to advance rapid needs assessment and prepare proposals to restore production and livelihoods [1][2][5]. This includes damage and needs assessment using drones and satellite remote sensing, along with ground-level data collection through surveys and key informant interviews, all of which will guide response and recovery planning [1][2][5]. USAID also has disaster experts on the ground in Jamaica actively supporting damage assessments and coordination efforts [8].\n*   **Direct Assistance and Financial Support:** Families in southern coastal areas, including Clarendon, Manchester, and St. Elizabeth, are in need of access to clean water, food, and reconstruction supplies for their homes, as well as psychological support [4][6]. In St Elizabeth, the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) Foundation and Food For The Poor (FFTP) Jamaica are providing care packages and access to charging stations [7]. Support to social protection systems is being implemented, including potential provision of food assistance to affected populations through existing government systems and modalities, and direct World Food Programme (WFP) assistance as required, utilizing cash-based transfers (CBT) and/or vouchers [13]. Investments in CBT assistance are expected to be complemented by a top-up of Jamaica's Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) policy, which, if triggered, will direct a fixed percentage of a potential CCRIF payout towards providing cash transfers to impacted people via the country's social protection system [13].\n*   **Infrastructure Restoration:** Hurricane Beryl most severely impacted Jamaica's southern coastal areas, causing damage to telecommunications, infrastructure, housing, public buildings, and healthcare facilities [4][6]. The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) and the National Water Commission (NWC) are working to restore utility services, including electricity and water, in affected communities [14].",
