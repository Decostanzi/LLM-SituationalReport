      "title: Rafah residents flee 'hell' of Israeli onslaught  content: May 12, 2024  Rafah Palestinian Territories AFPWar-weary Gazans flooded towards coastal areas of the Gaza Strip's southern city of Rafah on Sunday, fleeing heavy bombardment in eastern zones after Israel ordered them to evacuate. \"There are no medical services or humanitarian aid being provided to the displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip,\" said Mahmud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's civil defence agency. \"What we are witnessing in terms of killing and destruction reminds us of the early days of the aggression. \"Umm Mohammed Al-Mughayyir said she has had to move her family seven times to escape the fighting.",
      "Humanitarian aid must be allowed to flow freely and at scale. And the hostages and those arbitrarily detained must be released at once. \"After more than half a year of relentless strikes by the Israeli Forces across Gaza, there is no location outside of Rafah with the infrastructure and resources to host the mass displacement of over one million people, he added.International humanitarian law prohibits ordering the displacement of civilians for reasons related to the conflict, unless the security of civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand, and even then subject to strict legal requirements. Failure to meet these obligations may amount to forced displacement, which is a war crime.",
      "\"More attacks on what is now the primary humanitarian hub in the Gaza strip are not the answer,\" said Trk. \"The lessons of the past seven months of conflict in Gaza are clear  with women and children making up over 70 percent of the more than 120,000 killed, wounded and missing. Enough of the killing. \"First and foremost, there must be a ceasefire.",
      "\"Forcibly relocating hundreds of thousands from Rafah to areas which have already been flattened and where there is little shelter and virtually no access to humanitarian assistance necessary for their survival is inconceivable. It will only expose them to more danger and misery. \"Overnight, at least 26 Palestinians in Rafah were reportedly killed, mostly children and women. Today, two crossings into Rafah have been shut, completely halting the inflow of meagre levels of humanitarian aid.",
      "At the national Public Health Emergency Operations Centre, around 36 staff are monitoring and leading the health situation and response, supported by World Health Organization WHO and other partners such as Kenya Red Cross Society, AMREF, FHI360 and Foundation for Professional Development. The Ministry of Health has set up an incident management system team for surveillance, case management, laboratory, logistics and risk communication and community engagement to monitor and manage disease outbreaks. \"The whole-of-government approach, led by President William Ruto, is to ensure that we work across all sectors to minimize the pain for so many,\" says Dr Hilary Limo, the manager of the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre.The ministry has set up medical camps, with the support of Red Cross, for continuity of health services to over 4000 people who have been affected by health facility closure. Over 720 first responders, trained by WHO, are being deployed or on standby for deployment to flood-affected areas to provide health services to displaced people at the country's 192 camps.",
      "\"The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!\" he said in a statement.",
      "More than 120 of Kenya's public health professionals and experts, also trained by WHO are deployed at the national level. \"WHO will continue to support the health emergency response and remain vigilant for disease outbreaks that can easily spread if not quickly contained. We must be agile and ready to respond, led by government and along with the partners, to bring relief to hundreds and thousands of affected people,\" says Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO representative in Kenya.WHO has also procured around 87 cholera, 58 interagency and 20 pneumonia kits that are being distributed to key counties and can treat around 10 000 people. \"Going forward we will need to look at the impact of the floods, continuity of care and provide resilience capacity building to communities.",
      "title: Rapid response brings relief to flood-affected communities in Kenya  content: Nairobi  This year's long rainy season, which typically lasts from March to May every year, has hit Kenya hard, with unexpected heavy rainfall and widespread flooding since mid-April. Over 286 000 people have been affected, 47 000 households displaced and 238 deaths have been reported in 37 of the country's 47 counties.According to Dr Pius Mutuku, medical epidemiologist in the Ministry of Health, 14 health facilities have closed and a major water treatment plant has been affected by flooding, leading to a shortage of potable water for 3000 people. Forty-four cholera cases have been reported in Tana River County, one of the most flood-affected areas.The Government of Kenya has mounted a multisectoral emergency response, led by the Kenya Disaster Emergency Operations Centre in the country's capital, Nairobi. The centre gathers information from the 33 affected counties for analysis and decision making.",
      "\"We have reached a point where we wish for death,\" she said. \"We have people with special needs, elderly individuals, and children with us. Where do we go when the bombardment never stops, day and night? \"Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Sunday that a full-scale Israeli assault on Rafah \"cannot take place\", insisting that it cannot be squared with international law."

Instead, they indicate that humanitarian operations have been significantly disrupted[13], and many people are sheltering in horrific conditions without adequate access to food, water, or other essentials[12]. While Al-Mawasi is an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone[13], and some displaced Palestinians believe Al-Mawasi and Khan Younis are safe[11], the overall situation described points to a lack of such provisions[11]."

No aid has been received, and the crossing area is an active war zone with continued bombardments[31]. The Rafah crossing, which serves as the main entry point for aid into Gaza and a lifeline for its people, was seized by Israeli forces on Tuesday[34]. Since last Sunday, no aid has entered Gaza by land[38]. This closure has severed access to fuel, affecting the entry of critical relief items and curtailing the movement of aid workers[36]. Aid agencies are almost out of food and fuel in Gaza[38]. Fuel critical for humanitarian operations could run out soon, and some food stocks might only last to the end of the week[36]. Stocks of critical supplies, including fuel, are being depleted by the hour[33]. Israeli attacks on Rafah threaten the delivery of new aid supplies[32]. Additionally, more than a quarter of humanitarian missions to northern Gaza in April were impeded by Israeli authorities, and 10 percent were denied[34][40]. The situation remains extremely fluid amid active hostilities[31]."

But as Medical Aid for Palestinians MAP and other humanitarian agencies have long made clear: there are no safe spaces in Gaza.

About half of the population is children, many of whom have been repeatedly displaced and forced to shelter in tents and unstable housing.Children are more vulnerable to the impacts of the war in the Gaza Strip, compared to adults. At least 14,000 of those deaths are children.UNICEF reiterated a February statement by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee calling on Israel to facilitate aid operations to Gaza.",

At the same time, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are fleeing Rafah after the Israeli Defence Forces ordered further evacuations from the southern city, leading afresh to massive displacement of an already profoundly traumatized population. I am also concerned by reports of indiscriminate rocket fire from Gaza.Since 6 May, when the IDF issued an evacuation order to Palestinians in eastern Rafah, more than 278,000 people have been displaced. This includes people with disabilities, the chronically ill, older people, the injured, pregnant women, and many others who are physically unable to move without help.The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah."

Those who evacuate must have enough time to do so, as well as a safe route and a safe place to go.Our teams are still in Rafah where well over 1 million people, including 600,000 children, remain. We are also extending our presence northwards to assist the families who have moved there.We remain committed to providing aid to people, regardless of where they are. The decisions that are made today and their consequences in human suffering will be remembered by the generation that follows us.",
      "The IRC urgently calls on Israel to halt further violence in Rafah and across the Gaza strip, and for all parties to agree to an immediate and permanent ceasefire. The international community must wield all diplomatic influence at its disposal to bring the parties to an agreement and halt the humanitarian tragedy underway in Rafah. \"The International Rescue Committee IRC and Medical Aid for Palestinians MAP have deployed six successive Emergency Medical Teams to provide emergency and life-saving medical care, including direct medical care at hospitals, and the distribution of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Our teams have also procured or released vital pharmaceuticals and medical supplies which the IRC and our partners are distributing to support health facilities across Gaza.",
