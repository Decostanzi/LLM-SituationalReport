This situation hinders the implementation of a cohesive and effective response strategy to combat the outbreaks [2]. The provided sources do not contain specific information on how to enhance this coordination for all three concurrent outbreaks.",
    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "Healthcare infrastructures in Nigeria, particularly in the rural areas, lack the requisite resources and capacity to effectively manage Lassa fever cases. Shortages of personal protective equipment PPE, inadequate training on infection prevention and control practices has compromised the safety of healthcare workers and contributed to nosocomial transmission.Additionally, coordination among various stakeholders involved in the outbreak response is quite suboptimal. This is due to the concurrent outbreaks of Diphtheria, Cerebrospinal Meningitis CSM, and Lassa fever, with more attention given to diphtheria and CSM, thereby hindering the implementation of a cohesive and effective response strategy to combat the outbreak.In many affected areas, there is lack of specialized psychosocial support services, including counselling, therapy, and support groups, leaving individuals and communities without access to needed mental health care. Most healthcare workers and responders also lack training in providing psychosocial support, including skills in active listening, empathy, and trauma-informed care.A need was identified for enhanced community engagement and active case search in response to the Lassa fever outbreak.",

      "These teams were deployed within the first weeks of the outbreak to enhance epidemic readiness by engaging in the following activities: - Following the declaration of the Lassa Fever Outbreak, the NRCS activated her Health Action Team members across the states to initiate the following readiness activities: - Community Engagement and Education: Raise awareness about Lassa Fever prevention, symptoms, and treatment through campaigns and media. - Surveillance: Active case search and referral. - Health Promotion: Encouraging hygiene practices and demonstrating the use of protective equipment. - Psychosocial Support: Offering emotional support to affected individuals and communities.",
      "This strategic shift aimed to have a greater impact on saving lives through improved early detection and timely presentation of cases.While recent trends are encouraging, the battle against Lassa Fever is far from over, especially with the next outbreak season fast approaching. The NRCS has therefore begun engaging with the government, communities, and other partners to sustain community actions and develop long-term strategies that will reduce the impact of Lassa Fever in the affected communities.Source InformationSource Name 1. This extension also involves replacing Cross River State with Rivers State, following a recommendation from the NCDC. The additional time will allow the National Society to complete following critical activities: - Finalize the KAP survey, analyze the data, and use the results to organize round-table discussions with government stakeholders and TWG members on Lassa Fever.",
      "The NCDC has acknowledged the Red Cross' contributions, with the latest epidemiological data indicating a reduction in the number of new Lassa Fever cases compared to the earlier stages of the outbreak.Through this DREF Operation, the NRCS has significantly contributed to several key areas:Strengthened Surveillance and Early Detection: Red Cross volunteers are collaborating closely with state and local authorities to enhance disease surveillance systems, enabling the rapid identification and reporting of suspected Lassa Fever cases in all targeted areas.",
      "While efforts have been made to enhance the surveillance system Lassa fever, gaps still exist such as limited access to diagnostic testing, challenges in data collection, reporting, and underreporting of cases from the states. The NCDC has also pointed out that this was the peak season for Lassa fever outbreak, but due to the tension and fear of transmission and consequential deaths of healthcare workers, the community health workers are rejecting to investigate, assess, and report cases of Lassa fever. Furthermore, there is also a historical delay between the data collected at the community level and the available published reports which could hide a bigger situation.Also, in some of the endemic states, cases of Lassa fever were recorded in LGAs that have never reported cases in the past years, with increased fatality being that they were novices to the diseases. Following the general gaps in RCCE and case finding, the NCDC requested the NS to fill the gaps in those areas.",
      "This situation underscored the urgent need to engage communities in these areas to raise awareness about the signs and symptoms of Lassa fever and improve early detection and timely presentation of cases through active case searches and referrals.Page 2  18---NRCS Volunteers supporting Community Sanitation in Plateau StateScope and ScaleThe Lassa Fever outbreak in Nigeria has taken an alarming turn, spreading to areas that had never previously reported cases. This expansion posed significant challenges, as the newly affected states had limited experience in managing the disease and lacked the necessary resources and infrastructure for timely detection and response. In response to this evolving situation, the Red Cross scaled up its intervention efforts, targeting newly affected LGAs in the endemic states and the newly impacted states with high case fatalities.The Red Cross' intervention efforts have shown promising results, as reflected in the recent decline in the Lassa Fever epicurve over the past few weeks.",
      "To addressPage 8  18---this, Red Cross volunteers are now conducting door-to-door sensitization and active case search, referring individuals who meet the community case definition of Lassa fever to designated treatment centers. They are working with community leaders and gatekeepers to track and support sick individuals and those who may have had contact with infected persons, ensuring they are linked to appropriate care. This process is ongoing and involves close collaboration with the Disease Surveillance Notification Officer and the Ministry of Health to effectively manage and contain the outbreak.Water, Sanitation And HygieneWater, Sanitation, and Hygiene WASH play a crucial role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases like Lassa fever. Many communities in Nigeria lack access to safe and clean drinking water which impedes efforts to maintain proper hygiene practices, such as hand washing, which are essential for preventing the transmission of Lassa fever and other infectious diseases.",
      "Despite Lassa fever being endemic in Nigeria, the case fatality rate CFR of 18.8 reported in week 12 was alarming, revealing significant gaps in coordination with health partners, which raised considerable concerns. The number of suspected cases also surged dramatically to 5,029 from January to week 12 in 2024, compared to 3,361 during the same period in 2023.Among the worst-affected states, Bauchi, Taraba, Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Benue, and Cross River are endemic to Lassa fever. In contrast, Plateau, Rivers, and Anambra are newly affected states, where awareness of the symptoms, prevention, and treatment of the disease is minimal or non-existent. In Ebonyi and Benue, new LGAs that were not previously affected by Lassa fever began reporting cases, including within IDP camps in Benue State.",

Additionally, the telecommunications and electricity networks have been compromised in some locations. Flooding now covers more than 40 of Maiduguri, a city with an estimated population of over 870,000, including vulnerable populations in the Muna and Jere IDP camps.The immediate needs of those affected include food, shelter, clean water, and essential Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene WASH supplies.",
      "In Maiduguri alone, 37 bodies have been found, reported deaths, 58 persons with severe injuries, 389,267 persons displaced, 7,125 households have been affected in nine local government areas, and 7,337 land families have been washed away, with over 414,000 people utterly affected, wandering in search of shelter, security, and hope. \"More than 114,000 internally displaced persons have been directly affected, with many of their shelters affected and critically need to be washed as well as sanitation and hygiene facilities. \"These facilities have already been submerged, leaving people without clean water or sanitation. Road and transport networks have been destroyed, making it even harder to deliver much-needed aid.",
      "Malteser International distributes 800 cholera prevention kits and 1,000 hygiene kits in Bakasi refugee camp.The hygiene situation is very poor. The water masses bring feces and animal cadavers with them. Even before the breaking of the dam, the situation in Maiduguri was difficult due to the heavy rainfalls of the past weeks. But the water masses that have reached the city after the dam broke are immense.",
      "Other communities also remain isolated. The local telecommunications and electricity networks continue to be disconnected in some areas. The main market Monday Market in Maiduguri is still flooded, affecting access to food with markets moving to other parts of Maiduguri often disrupting road traffic and potentially causing security issues.The numbers of people registered in relocation sites and the number of sites keep increasing. Many sites are crowded with open defecation taking place.",
