This standoff has led to numerous incidents of violence, including the recent clash in Gwadar where a protest by the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee turned violent, resulting in the death of one soldier and injuries to 16 others. The loss of life, whether of a protester or a soldier, is deeply painful for every Pakistani patriot, underscoring the urgent need for competent governance and peaceful resolution of conflicts.Like violent movements that should have no place in a democratic country, another deeply worrying phenomenon reflecting a serious fault line in our national fabric is the issuance of fatwas calling for the death of anyone contradicting the fatwa giver's religious philosophy.", "title: Fatwa and Gwadar incident  content: THE situation in Pakistan is deeply troubling as the incompetence of politicians and civil administration has forced the army into handling sensitive ethnic, religious, cultural, and social conflicts, areas outside its training and primary purpose. The army is primarily trained to combat foreign enemies and assist the civilian government only when law and order are beyond civilian control. For example, during the Paris Olympics, over 10,000 military personnel provided security but returned to barracks after the event. In Pakistan, however, due to the persistent failures of political and civil leaders, the army is repeatedly called upon to manage conflicts that should be the civilian government's responsibility.During my over four decades of experience, I have frequently interacted with the Army Command when they were called to assist civilians.", "Therefore, it is imperative to address and reverse this situation promptly.

While their presence and flag marches may initially intimidate the populace, this effect diminishes as people grow accustomed to the army's involvement in civilian matters.The involvement of the army in civilian affairs, driven by the incompetence of politicians and the civil administration, has severely damaged its image.

The new model could create maps that predict urban area flooding, which traditionally have not been accessible to urban planners. This could help identify potentially flood-prone areas in urban settings, helping officials make better-informed choices about where to allocate flood resiliency and prevention resources.Rebecca Composto, a graduate student at NC State and lead author of a paper describing the model, said that urban areas present unique challenges in collecting satellite data and tracking the flow of water. \"One of the first issues is building shadows.", "To create sufficient training data for the model to recognize urban flooding, Composto spent months hand-drawing polygons onto her satellite imagery to help the program understand what it was looking at. These polygons helped the machine-learning algorithm \"see\" the characteristics of satellite imagery most aligned with flooding and then map the flooding.Composto then compared the resulting map, known as a flood extent, to Federal Emergency Management Agency flood zones. These zones designate areas depending on how likely they are to flood - for example, a \"500-year\" flood zone has an approximately 1-in-500 chance of flooding each year. Other areas are deemed \"minimal flood hazard,\" which places them outside the limit of the 500-year flood designation.The model found that more flooding was occurring in these minimal hazard areas than in the 500-year zones.", "Several areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, were isolated, and roads were washed away causing immense damage to homes, said Kerala's top elected official, Pinarayi Vijayan. \"Efforts to locate missing persons continue with all available resources,\" their statement said.Mundakka is in an area highly prone to disasters.
