      "question": " What are the current legal challenges faced by owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, and how do these challenges impact their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program?",
      "retrieved_answer": "Owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine face several legal challenges that impact their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program.\n\n**Legal Challenges:**\n*   **Difficulty in Property Registration:** Most Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs) in temporarily occupied territories were not relocated to Government of Ukraine-controlled territory, or were damaged, destroyed, or looted, making it very difficult or impossible to obtain necessary information for state registration of property rights (SRPR) [3][5][8]. The law obliges state registrars to receive information from BTIs for state registration of rights [5][8]. Owners who acquired ownership before 2013 specifically face problems registering their rights in the SRPR, even with hard copies of title documents [4][5]. As a result, these owners often have to undergo a judicial procedure to recognize their right of ownership, which involves paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof [3][6].\n*   **Inheritance Issues:** Notaries commonly refuse to open inheritance cases for property located in temporarily occupied territory, likely due to potential legal responsibility [6][9]. This forces heirs to apply to the court to confirm ownership in the order of inheritance, also requiring them to pay a court fee and bear the burden of proof [6][9].\n\n**Impact on eRecovery Compensation:**\n*   **Pre-condition for Application:** Registration of property rights in the SRPR is a pre-condition to apply for compensation through the eRecovery program [4][5]. The aforementioned difficulties in registration directly impede an owner's ability to meet this requirement.\n*   **Program Scope Limitation:** The eRecovery program would provide compensation for housing in temporarily occupied territories *only* in cases of destruction, because determining the degree of damage to housing based on satellite images is not possible [4][5].\n*   **Program Expansion Status:** While there are plans to expand the eRecovery program to other temporarily occupied territories, including Mariupol and Bakhmut [1][2], these plans are likely subject to funding support [1][2]. A relevant draft law is registered in the Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) and is preparing for the second reading [2].",

Considering an ambitious 10-year plan by the Ukrainian government and the international community, it will cost over USD 486 billion to fund reconstruction efforts World Bank, 2024. Although devastating, this juncture can be a watershed moment for Ukrainian society to \"build back better. \"Ukraine aims to capitalize upon its reconstruction to transform its economy and society to become climate resilient and inclusive.",
        "Helping Ukraine to prosper should be just as big a priority for those who believe Ukraine's victory is key to preventing further Russian aggression and sending a cautionary message to other autocrats around the world. While rarely dismissed out of hand, the reconstruction is intuitively seen by many in the West as secondary to the need to help Ukraine fight back against aggression. This is understandable, but neglects how reviving the Ukrainian economyand the government's cash flowalso helps the war effort through additional funds, resources, and motivation.The Ukrainian government is staffed by clever, innovative experts capable of expressing a clear vision of how to reach prosperity. But when the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center and GeoEconomics Center embarked on a weeklong research trip in February 2024 to meet them, Kyiv faced cash-flow problems and high uncertainty over future macrofinancial assistance, especially from the United States.The situation has since improved, not least thanks to the US supplemental spending law that includes 10 billion of budgetary supportbut it's imperative that the West does not create doubts about its support for Ukraine again in 2025.",
        "The macrofinancial assistance meant to keep Ukraine's government functioning cannot finance the recovery as well. In addition to central government funds, a myriad of Western grants and loans need to be tied to individual projects. The innovative systems designed to implement this are up and running but not always used to their full potential.This report provides a snapshot of the economic, societal, and energy-security situation on the ground, capturing key challenges and opportunities for supporting Ukraine's survival and building a more prosperous future. It also explores how the country can meaningfully contribute to Europe's economic growth and strategic autonomy at large through innovation, energy security, decarbonization, and diversified supply chains.",
        "However, sustainable efforts may not seem a priority to many in the context of the ongoing war. With so much unpredictability, added costs, and long payback periods, sustainable measures may not seem feasible.Nevertheless, this does not have to be the case. Learning from prior post-disaster recoveries, planning at the European Union EU and national levels can synchronize to effectively allocate resources that maximize the economic and sustainable impacts of reconstruction.This brief particularly investigates the pragmatic implementation of energy-efficiency measures in residential buildingsa tangible topic ready to be implemented during and after the war.",
        "title: Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024 in Berlin: Time for Women to Lead in Recovery  content: Bonn, June 7, 2024  In anticipation of the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024 in Berlin on June 11 and 12, the international humanitarian organization CARE continues to call for all reconstruction and recovery processes to ensure the participation of Ukrainian women and to promote gender equality. So far, the priorities and needs of women have hardly been considered in the discussions on reconstruction. \"The meaningful and direct participation of women, girls and marginalized groups in all decision-making processes is key to forming a recovery agenda that is equitable, inclusive, gender-responsive, and truly effective,\" says Franziska Jrns, CARE Ukraine Deputy Country Director. \"We need to protect and ensure equitable access to services they need and opportunities to rebuild their lives.",
        "\"Gender equality has received very little attention in the previous two Ukraine Recovery Conferences in Lugano in 2022 and in London in 2023. It has also been largely absent from the various recovery and reconstruction plans that have been formulated by donor governments and international organizations. But Ukrainian women's rights and women-led organizations continue to drive efforts to meet the needs of the most vulnerable groups and provide vital assistance to survivors of gender-based violence. They are advocating for the rights of women and girls and are essential to increase the participation of those groups in processes and decisions that affect them now and will continue to impact them after the war.",

Within Ukraine, Episcopal Relief  Development is working with the ACT Alliance to help people who have fled the violence with shelter, food, water and counseling services.Since the onset of the war in 2022, millions of war refugees have entered Europe and have overwhelmed the support systems, which has made successful integration even more difficult for all refugees. Episcopal Relief  Development has been working with local partners through the ACT Alliance and CECE to meet basic needs, and is beginning to transition to longer-term sustainable efforts. In partnership with CECE, Episcopal Relief  Development is offering trauma-informed care and mental health support in addition to helping refugees find work."

By the end of August 2022, the count of individual Ukrainian refugees residing in Moldova had risen to 109,055. The winter season poses increased vulnerabilities for both refugees and Moldovan citizens due to elevated living costs, primarily attributed to additional heating expenses. Severe weather conditions can create additional obstacles to accessing services and community life for specific groups, notably older persons, individuals with disabilities, and single-headed households with a high dependency ratio.According to UNHCR's Post-Distribution Monitoring PDM of Multipurpose Cash Assistance, despite sustained humanitarian efforts, substantial needs persist among the refugee population.",

      "retrieved_answer": "Owners of destroyed housing in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine face several legal challenges that impact their ability to receive compensation through the eRecovery program.\n\n**Legal Challenges:**\n*   **Difficulty in Property Registration:** Most Bureaus of Technical Inventory (BTIs) in temporarily occupied territories were not relocated to Government of Ukraine-controlled territory, or were damaged, destroyed, or looted, making it very difficult or impossible to obtain necessary information for state registration of property rights (SRPR) [3][5][8]. The law obliges state registrars to receive information from BTIs for state registration of rights [5][8]. Owners who acquired ownership before 2013 specifically face problems registering their rights in the SRPR, even with hard copies of title documents [4][5]. As a result, these owners often have to undergo a judicial procedure to recognize their right of ownership, which involves paying a court fee and bearing the burden of proof [3][6].\n*   **Inheritance Issues:** Notaries commonly refuse to open inheritance cases for property located in temporarily occupied territory, likely due to potential legal responsibility [6][9]. This forces heirs to apply to the court to confirm ownership in the order of inheritance, also requiring them to pay a court fee and bear the burden of proof [6][9].\n\n**Impact on eRecovery Compensation:**\n*   **Pre-condition for Application:** Registration of property rights in the SRPR is a pre-condition to apply for compensation through the eRecovery program [4][5]. The aforementioned difficulties in registration directly impede an owner's ability to meet this requirement.\n*   **Program Scope Limitation:** The eRecovery program would provide compensation for housing in temporarily occupied territories *only* in cases of destruction, because determining the degree of damage to housing based on satellite images is not possible [4][5].\n*   **Program Expansion Status:** While there are plans to expand the eRecovery program to other temporarily occupied territories, including Mariupol and Bakhmut [1][2], these plans are likely subject to funding support [1][2].

        "Unfortunately, the situation is worsening each day, putting more lives at risk,\" said Claudia Amaral, Head of the EU Humanitarian Aid Office in Ukraine. \"This is why the European Union is investing efforts and funds to clear Ukraine of deadly explosive traps and to raise awareness among Ukrainians, especially the youngest, about how to protect themselves from all the dangers of living in contaminated regions. \"The study shows that educational institutions and parents are the primary sources of explosive ordnance risk education for adolescents. Children from contaminated areas receive this information mainly through their teachers, parents, State Emergency Service workers, the military and the police.",
        "Additionally, the role of caregivers, schools and other institutions in teaching children mine safety rules, mine risk awareness and safe behaviour practices were assessed.A total of 25,500 respondents were surveyed 12,750 parents and 12,750 adolescents, including a nationwide random sample 4,128 respondents representative of families with children aged 10-17 years, and a booster random sample 21,372 respondents representative of families with children aged 10-17 years from each of the 27 contaminated districts in the Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Chernihiv regions. The survey was conducted in all areas except for non-government-controlled areas and areas where mobile communication was unavailable at the time of the survey.The Rating Lab research laboratory, professional child psychologists and social and behavioural change experts from UNICEF developed a test to assess knowledge of mine safety rules and identify risk behaviours in children aged 10 to 17. The test formed the basis of a quantitative telephone survey of parents and a quantitative online survey test of children.",

This highlights the critical role of parental engagement in fostering safe behaviour among adolescents.Myths about mines affecting perceptions of safe behaviour  According to the qualitative phase of the study, a significant proportion of adolescents believe in common myths about EOs. These include misconceptions that using a mobile phone near a mine can trigger its detonation, that an EO will become inert after lying in the ground for several years, that it is safe to touch unexploded ordnance or detonated mines and approach anti-tank mines, and that mines can be touched carefully if sappers have already removed the TNT. \"Russia's war has already left Ukraine with a deadly legacy of explosive ordnance and mines, which will take decades to clear.",

      "retrieved_answer": "Households without a person with a disability generally reported being more aware of protection services, primarily state social services, than those with a member with a disability [5].\n\nHowever, for specific services:\n*   Households with a person with a disability reported higher awareness (between 97% and 99%) regarding services for reporting cases of violence against children in the community, compared to households without a person with a disability (95%) [2].\n*   Between 69% and 73% of households with a person with a disability reported awareness of how to access gender-based violence services available in Slovakia, compared to 73% reported by households without a person with disabilities [2].\n*   Awareness of psychosocial support services was slightly higher in households with a member with a disability [4].",

In general, HH with a family member with a disability reported a slightly higher percentage of hostile behavior from the host community.Rather positive results were received in relation to assistance provided, including on information for available services as well as in-kind support. Among the total number of HH with at least one member with disability 295, only between 14 and 17 of HH reported not having received any assistance in the last 3 months11. In terms of satisfaction, HH with a person with disability presents higher satisfaction levels, between 74 and 76, and only between 6 and 8 of households with a member with disability reported dissatisfaction with the assistance received.",
        "According to the analysis, \"the government together with international and community-level organizations should address the informational barrier that carers face in access to healthcare, education, social benefits, etc. In an often-changing legislative environment, working on periodic and timely informational campaigns that target not only Ukrainian carers but also local practitioners and social workers assisting this demographic is crucial in making the already available services more accessible. \".13With regards to awareness of available services to reach out to and the possibility to report cases of violence against children in the community, HH with a person with disability reported higher awareness on those services, between 97 and 99, compared to HH without a person with disability 95. In addition, between 69 and 73 of HH with a person with disability reported awareness on how to access gender-based violence services available in Slovakia, compared to the 73 reported by HH without a person with disabilities.Economic vulnerability  livelihoodsOverall, persons with disability reported lower education level in comparison to those with no reported disability; higher percentage was obtained on secondary and vocational education on individuals with disability, and master's degree was more cited by persons with no disability.",
        "Additionally, families with children with a disability may face additional financial burden to provide for therapies, as presented in the analysis of the Platform of Families with Children with Disabilities:\"many families experience financial hardship due to the cost of care for their child with disability and are seeking extra income. In general, HH with a person with disability reported being benefited in a larger scale, while between 47 and 37 of HH with a person with disability reported being covered by the Slovak social protection system. This presents a significant difference compared to HH without members with disability 15 which is easily understandable, as the Slovak social protection system is designed to support the most vulnerable groups, with a specific cash assistance to persons with disabilities. Similar results were obtained on the benefits received from the Ukrainian social protection system, however, only 4 of HH without a member with disability reported being covered by this assistance.",
        "This highlights that, still, some of the basic needs are not met by refugees and in particular among HH with persons with disabilities. Considering that, as per the MSNA results, access to employment and language courses remain among the top priority needs for the overall refugee population, thus, the findings for those with disabilities indicates considerable needs in connection with their vulnerabilities.In addition, it can be observed that HH with a person with disability are exposed to more vulnerabilities and challenges towards their inclusion in the host community. Children with vulnerabilities face major barriers in accessing education28, thus severely limiting their prospects of accessing lifelong learning and livelihoods opportunities. HH with a person with disability are more likely to adopt negative coping strategies 56 on HH with a person with disabilities, compared to 39 on HH without persons with disabilities, and are more at risk of economic vulnerability, such as lower income, lower employability and limited access to financial systems which may result in higher poverty rates and social exclusion.Yet, HH with a person with disability presented less challenges in accessing the healthcare system; which it can be related to their need of using frequently this type of services, being more awared and familiarized with them, or living in an accommodation type where health services are provided as Humenne.",
        "Visual limitation was the most reported condition with a low level of severity, while remembering and self-dressing were less reported with a higher severity level.Priority needs The 2023 MSNA highlighted specific priority needs for the refugees coming from Ukraine, including about access to healthcare services, employment and livelihoods, language courses, accommodation options, food and medicines. A comparative analysis of data between those HH with at least one member with disability and HH with no member with disability shows that slightly more priority needs were reported by the former group between 86-89, compared to the latter 81. While reported needs in the group with no members with disability were widely spread, the most cited priorities needs for HH with at least a person with disability were healthcare services and medicines. An interesting observation which needs to be further explored is the fact that accommodation and employmentlivelihood was reported as a problem by less HH with disabilities than in those without members with disabilities.",
        "They are often surprised at the very low number of regular schools that integrate children with disability in Slovakia\".8 As the Platform further reported, \"families may not disclose their child's diagnosis in order to facilitate their enrollment in school or their integration in the wider society\". Additional information provided by the study presented important concerns frequently cited by parents regarding lack of disability-adapted early childhood and formal education capacities. In addition, bullying remains an important concern raised by parents of children with disabilities. In general, HH with no person with a disability reported being more aware of protection services mainly state social services, than those with a member with disability.",
        "Only between 6 and 8 of households with a member with disability reported dissatisfaction with the assistance received. The high satisfaction might be related to multi-purpose cash and material need assistance provision available for persons with disabilities, particularly provided by MOLSAF. 11 This refers to any kind of assistance provided by humanitarian actors, government, or other entities. 12 Data provided by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and the Family of SR upon reguest.---In particular, respondents were asked if they encountered any challenges accessing information needed including information on rights and entitlements, access to services.",
        "Persons with disabilities have the same basic needs as other refugees, but often face barriers to receiving the required assistance, or specific attention and targeted interventions. The situation is more challenging for refugee children with disabilities as they have limited access to education, health, child and social protection services. The analysis is presented across sectors, based on the MSNA 2023 collected information, and complemented with information from secondary sources, such as focus groups discussions and previous analysis.",
        "This percentage differs in the case of HH with a person with disability, which represents between 17 and 14. \"Financial support related to disability in Slovakia is a complex and long-term process\"Adult person during a focus group discussion in TrnavaThe comparative analysis shows that HH with a person with disability tend to make less use of financial services, such as a bank account or an account at a formal financial institution in Slovakia. Between 76 and 70 of respondents reported using this kind of services, compared to the 80 of HH without a member with a disability. The degree of serious disability is assessed by social workers of the Ministry following a questionnaire based on WHODAS22.",
        "However, a further in-depth survey would be necessary to understand the hindrances HH with a member with disabilities may be facing in the access to information. This might also indicate isolation and a lower level of inclusion in local communities, which is unfortunately the case in the domestic population as well.In addition, better planning and responses requires official disaggregated data on refugees with disabilities, on needs, barriers, additional cost of living, as well as the available support and type of participation and inclusion opportunities of children, adolescents and persons with disabilities. In this connection, apart of the sectoral information on education and health, it is critical to facilitate evidence-based planning for humanitarian actors and other stakeholders.Many of those priorities are reflected in the UKRAINE SITUATION REGIONAL REFUGEE RESPONSE PLAN 2024 for Slovakia. The strategic objective 2 calls for action so that \"Refugees with specific needs and vulnerabilities have access to targeted support and assistance.\""

By the end of August 2022, the count of individual Ukrainian refugees residing in Moldova had risen to 109,055. The winter season poses increased vulnerabilities for both refugees and Moldovan citizens due to elevated living costs, primarily attributed to additional heating expenses. Severe weather conditions can create additional obstacles to accessing services and community life for specific groups, notably older persons, individuals with disabilities, and single-headed households with a high dependency ratio.According to UNHCR's Post-Distribution Monitoring PDM of Multipurpose Cash Assistance, despite sustained humanitarian efforts, substantial needs persist among the refugee population.",

In Ukraine, URCS attained co-chair status in the CWG [4], which was facilitated by the expert's leadership and training efforts [4]. This led to URCS taking on a more significant role in external coordination structures [11].

        "The conference aims to generate government aid and private-sector investment for \"recovery, reconstruction, reform, and modernization\" in Ukraine.In the midst of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian authorities have pledged to carry out education reforms intended to keep children learning safely, and also initiated a new strategy to end the harmful, Soviet-era legacy of institutionalizing children deemed to have disabilities or to be from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Human Rights Watch research found the needs are vast and that continued international support may be critical for success. \"A better future for Ukraine means taking the steps needed for every child to realize their potential, and there should be no backsliding in Berlin,\" said Bill Van Esveld, associate children's rights director at Human Rights Watch. \"Getting an education and living in a family rather than an institution are not nice-to-haves, but are a child's fundamental rights, and they deserve full donor support.",

        "The EU and Ukraine should continue to prioritize deinstitutionalization and care reform as part of Ukraine's reconstruction and EU integration.Under previous governments, several efforts at reforming systems for caring for children with disabilities had failed, as civil society groups were marginalized and reform plans were undermined to exclude children with disabilities. Donors should continue to work closely with Ukrainian civil society groups that are leading the effort for meaningful reforms that ensure all children's access to protection and education, and their rights to live in a family and in a community, Human Rights Watch and the Ukraine Child Rights Network said. \"Ukraine's recovery needs to prioritize children's rights, especially education, over rebuilding institutional care facilities and special schools' segregation practices,\" said Daria Kasyanova, Ukrainian Child Rights Network board chair. \"Deinstitutionalization reform is crucial, it means placing human and children's rights at the forefront.\"",
        "\"Human Rights Watch has documented vast damage and destruction to Ukrainian schools and preschools from attacks, as well as from Russian forces that occupied, pillaged, and trashed schools during the first months of the fighting. However, many parents and children lack the devices and connectivity needed for distance learning, Human Rights Watch found, which moreover may not be accessible for children with disabilities. Ukrainian authorities also require schools to have adequate bomb shelters to resume in-person education.At the Berlin conference, Ukraine's international partners and donors should help the authorities ensure access to quality education for all children, including by restoring damaged educational facilities across Ukraine, in line with safety requirements and strict adherence to accessibility standards mandatory under Ukrainian law. Donor funding should support the development of inclusive rather than segregated education, the groups said.The full-scale invasion also exacerbated the risks to 105,000 children in institutions in Ukraine, including family separation, neglect, and forcible transfer and deportation by Russian and occupation authorities.",

Vouchers in healthcare therefore, must aim at facilitating access to services for a specific pre-identified category of beneficiaries including vulnerable persons who would be unable to access these services without such planning. These results indicate the inability of those most affected by the war to access health services and medications in front line communities.In response to these gaps, humanitarian actors have been inclined to facilitate access, enabling health care availability in communities most affected by the war. While partners delve to provide immediate solutions, the approach should aim at fostering the use of mechanisms set by the MoH where available, including facilitating access to the AMP through mobile pharmacies, UkrPoshta and other means.",
        "The framework identifies five dimensions that contribute to health care access: availability, accessibility, affordability, acceptability, and quality. Figure 1 demonstrates how CVA for health can remove the barriers individuals might face in accessing health care services in areas affected by the war.The complexity of health services delivery in front line and hard-to-reach areas demonstrates the need to consider integrated programming, in which CVA is considered complementary to supply side and government health financing rather than a replacement. Integrated programming acknowledges that health outcomes are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond access to health care services. WHO raion level assessment.",

Such opportunities could relate to existing frameworksservices within and outside the public sector. Situational analyses should also incorporate aspects relating to social determinants affecting the availability and accessibility of desired health services.Findings from the review of secondary data and contextual assessment should be presented to local health authorities and CVA for Health Task Team with suggestions of how CVA can meet the health needs without disrupting the existing health system. Synergies with existing programs and approaches should be clarified e.g.",

Primarily encourage the use of medicines providedmentioned under the above government frameworks. Avoid programming which encourages patient access to medicines outside government frameworks when these or their equivalents are available. Only temporarily cover gaps of services medicines not available as part of the government framework, by making arrangements for these using a voucher system with a third-party provider.",

Furthermore, health needs can be costly, unpredictable, and thus challenging to be met through recurrent MPC payments. Allegations of corruption from both out- of-pocket and informal payments in health only reinforce cash in health as a sensitive topic.To provide guidance and organize the implementation of cash and voucher assistance in health, the Health Cluster is adopting a sector-specific approach to inform the process, taking into account the challenges which exist while capping the volume of emergency HNRP support, which can be implemented using a voucher approach. Sectoral cash and voucher assistance in health shouldn't disrupt regular functioning of the health system but should complement it with a clear phase-out strategy incorporated during the planning process.Ukraine CVA for Health Framework conceptual modelThe Ukraine CVA for Health Framework is informed by the Tanahashi framework, a conceptual model used in public health to assess bottlenecks and improve access to health care services.",

Positioning Sectoral Cash and Voucher Assistance in HealthSeveral assessment findings have highlighted an increase in household expenditures on health mostly related to the purchase of medicines since the 2022 escalation of the war.

        "Unfortunately, the situation is worsening each day, putting more lives at risk,\" said Claudia Amaral, Head of the EU Humanitarian Aid Office in Ukraine. \"This is why the European Union is investing efforts and funds to clear Ukraine of deadly explosive traps and to raise awareness among Ukrainians, especially the youngest, about how to protect themselves from all the dangers of living in contaminated regions. \"The study shows that educational institutions and parents are the primary sources of explosive ordnance risk education for adolescents. Children from contaminated areas receive this information mainly through their teachers, parents, State Emergency Service workers, the military and the police.",
        "title: 53 of Ukrainian teenagers engage in risky behaviour despite being well-informed about risks posed by mines and unexploded ordnance UNICEF study ENUK - Ukraine  content: Kyiv, 6 June 2024  A study conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF and the Rating Group on explosive ordnance risk awareness and safe behaviour practices among Ukrainian parents and children aged 10 to 17 has revealed that boys aged 14 to 17 62 per cent and adolescents from rural areas and low-income families demonstrate the riskiest behaviours. Boys aged 14 to 17 are the most likely to exhibit dangerous behaviour related to explosive ordnance EO. They are more independent, spend more time away from home and explore new places. Additionally, adolescents from rural areas and low-income families face a higher risk of engaging in hazardous behaviour.",
        "This underscores the importance of focusing our efforts on improving risk perception and promoting safe behaviour and practices. \"Over 80 per cent of young people in Ukraine can identify explosives. Adolescents also know better 67 per cent than their parents 42 per cent which number to call 101 if they see a dangerous object. It turns out that younger children know this number best.",
        "In contrast, adolescents in contaminated areas of the Chernihiv, Kyiv and Zhytomyr regions showed lower awareness levels, similar to those in non-contaminated' central areas. The lowest awareness was found among adolescents from the western regions, where the threat of mines and unexploded ordnance UXO is minimal. \"It is important to understand that high awareness doesn't always equal safe behaviour,\" said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative to Ukraine. \"Children who are informed about mine safety might still demonstrate risky behaviours."

The plant's electricity grid has been severely impacted by the conflict, leading to repeated losses of connections to all its power lines[21]. The external power situation is extremely vulnerable and prone to frequent outages[21]. Before the conflict, ZNPP had four 750 kV lines available, but only one remains[22]. The line itself is unavailable due to damage sustained earlier in the conflict, away from the site[22].\n\nRegarding repair plans, the ZNPP is not currently planning to complete repairs at this time[22].\n\nThese issues affect the plant's operations as a loss of off-site power has the potential to be more serious due to higher nuclear fuel temperatures for reactors in operation in Ukraine[21]. Director General Grossi reiterated that the ZNPP would not be re-started as long as nuclear safety and security remained in jeopardy due to the conflict[21]. However, IAEA experts were informed that nuclear safety and security is being maintained despite the ongoing conflict[22]."

IntroductionIn the 2024 Ukraine Humanitarian Needs  Response Plan HNRP, the Health Cluster identified 7.8 million individuals, including IDPs, returnees and non-displaced people in need of humanitarian health assistance including Mental Health support. Of these, 3.8 million people were targeted for assistance in the southern, eastern, and northern oblasts bordering the front line. Along with service delivery, and the procurement and distribution of medicines and supplies, cash and voucher assistance has been one of the accepted modalities of providing health assistance by health partners as stated in the HNRP.Since the launch of the HNRP in December 2023, air strikes have intensified in areas nearest the frontline and those bordering the Russian Federation.",
        "With regards to the AMP, the program now accepts paper-based prescriptions and allows internally displaced patients to receive medications without obtaining a new prescription or receiving a prescription from a PHC doctor who they do not have a declaration signed with. Recently, the NHSU broadened the AMP to include painkillers for palliative care patients, immunosuppressive drugs and test strips for determining blood glucose levels in type I diabetes.5 In 2024, the AMP will further expand to include additional medicines for the treatment of mental health conditions. To increase access to medicines, mobile pharmacies were launched in rural and frontline communities in Cherkasy, Kharkivska, Mykolaivksa, Kyivska, and Chernihivska regions. In frontline oblasts, health care is impeded by security constraints, transport, and infrastructural challenges.Since the escalation of the war in 2022, the Health Cluster team through the WHO Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care has verified 1,814 attacks on health care in Ukraine as of June 2024, with 143 deaths and 342 injuries to health care workers and patients.",
        "Such patients should be identified and mapped prior to initiating the health project.---Cash assistance to patients to procure medicines themselves should be avoided. Where transportation is required, modalities avoiding direct cash transfer is encouraged and the partner facilitates these using existing transportation networks. Partners will be required to discuss locally with the local departments of health to provide evidence on the consideration of medicines from the EML list.Vulnerability and targeting criteriaWhile all of Ukraine has been affected by the ongoing war, the Cluster's estimation and analysis of needs shows a decreasing severity of humanitarian needs as the distance from active hostilities increases, while those in the southern, eastern, and northern oblasts bordering the front line are more severe. Individual status: The elderly and people with disabilities, who have difficulties in accessing health care, pregnant women children, who are at risk of several health issues, people without documentation in need of health care services.",
        "Health partners should encourage patients to access national services provided free-of-charge where the war has not rendered such services damaged or destroyed.Partners making arrangements should adhere to the following principles:Promote the use of the Ukrainian AMP pharmacies, UkrPoshta and Government Mobile pharmacies where services are available and not absent due to the war. Primarily encourage the use of medicines providedmentioned under the above government frameworks. Avoid programming which encourages patient access to medicines outside government frameworks when these or their equivalents are available. Only temporarily cover gaps of services medicines not available as part of the government framework, by making arrangements for these using a voucher system with a third-party provider.",

In 2024, FAO has already supported 33 430 rural families with cash and voucher assistance and drip irrigation kits to enable them to cover their immediate needs and restore and keep production. Moreover, 3 130 farmers benefited from the distribution of spring crops seeds, generators, temporary storage equipment, animal feed, and cash and vouchers. Due to the tense security situation in Kharkivska oblast, FAO will scale up its activities in the region, cooperating closely with the Government of Ukraine, local authorities and non-governmental organizations NGOs.",

Vouchers in healthcare therefore, must aim at facilitating access to services for a specific pre-identified category of beneficiaries including vulnerable persons who would be unable to access these services without such planning. These results indicate the inability of those most affected by the war to access health services and medications in front line communities.In response to these gaps, humanitarian actors have been inclined to facilitate access, enabling health care availability in communities most affected by the war. While partners delve to provide immediate solutions, the approach should aim at fostering the use of mechanisms set by the MoH where available, including facilitating access to the AMP through mobile pharmacies, UkrPoshta and other means.",
        "MPCA cash is unrestricted and can be used for other household needs and services prioritized by the beneficiary. Furthermore, health needs can be costly, unpredictable, and thus challenging to be met through recurrent MPC payments. Allegations of corruption from both out- of-pocket and informal payments in health only reinforce cash in health as a sensitive topic.To provide guidance and organize the implementation of cash and voucher assistance in health, the Health Cluster is adopting a sector-specific approach to inform the process, taking into account the challenges which exist while capping the volume of emergency HNRP support, which can be implemented using a voucher approach. Sectoral cash and voucher assistance in health shouldn't disrupt regular functioning of the health system but should complement it with a clear phase-out strategy incorporated during the planning process.Ukraine CVA for Health Framework conceptual modelThe Ukraine CVA for Health Framework is informed by the Tanahashi framework, a conceptual model used in public health to assess bottlenecks and improve access to health care services.",

Among the total number of HH with at least one member with disability 295, only between 14 and 17 of HH reported not having received any assistance in the last 3 months11. In terms of satisfaction, HH with a person with disability presents higher satisfaction levels, between 74 and 76, and only between 6 and 8 of households with a member with disability reported dissatisfaction with the assistance received.",
        "According to the analysis, \"the government together with international and community-level organizations should address the informational barrier that carers face in access to healthcare, education, social benefits, etc. In an often-changing legislative environment, working on periodic and timely informational campaigns that target not only Ukrainian carers but also local practitioners and social workers assisting this demographic is crucial in making the already available services more accessible. \".13With regards to awareness of available services to reach out to and the possibility to report cases of violence against children in the community, HH with a person with disability reported higher awareness on those services, between 97 and 99, compared to HH without a person with disability 95. In addition, between 69 and 73 of HH with a person with disability reported awareness on how to access gender-based violence services available in Slovakia, compared to the 73 reported by HH without a person with disabilities.Economic vulnerability  livelihoodsOverall, persons with disability reported lower education level in comparison to those with no reported disability; higher percentage was obtained on secondary and vocational education on individuals with disability, and master's degree was more cited by persons with no disability.",
        "Additionally, families with children with a disability may face additional financial burden to provide for therapies, as presented in the analysis of the Platform of Families with Children with Disabilities:\"many families experience financial hardship due to the cost of care for their child with disability and are seeking extra income. In general, HH with a person with disability reported being benefited in a larger scale, while between 47 and 37 of HH with a person with disability reported being covered by the Slovak social protection system. This presents a significant difference compared to HH without members with disability 15 which is easily understandable, as the Slovak social protection system is designed to support the most vulnerable groups, with a specific cash assistance to persons with disabilities. Similar results were obtained on the benefits received from the Ukrainian social protection system, however, only 4 of HH without a member with disability reported being covered by this assistance.",
        "This highlights that, still, some of the basic needs are not met by refugees and in particular among HH with persons with disabilities. Considering that, as per the MSNA results, access to employment and language courses remain among the top priority needs for the overall refugee population, thus, the findings for those with disabilities indicates considerable needs in connection with their vulnerabilities.In addition, it can be observed that HH with a person with disability are exposed to more vulnerabilities and challenges towards their inclusion in the host community. Children with vulnerabilities face major barriers in accessing education28, thus severely limiting their prospects of accessing lifelong learning and livelihoods opportunities. HH with a person with disability are more likely to adopt negative coping strategies 56 on HH with a person with disabilities, compared to 39 on HH without persons with disabilities, and are more at risk of economic vulnerability, such as lower income, lower employability and limited access to financial systems which may result in higher poverty rates and social exclusion.Yet, HH with a person with disability presented less challenges in accessing the healthcare system; which it can be related to their need of using frequently this type of services, being more awared and familiarized with them, or living in an accommodation type where health services are provided as Humenne.",
        "Visual limitation was the most reported condition with a low level of severity, while remembering and self-dressing were less reported with a higher severity level.Priority needs The 2023 MSNA highlighted specific priority needs for the refugees coming from Ukraine, including about access to healthcare services, employment and livelihoods, language courses, accommodation options, food and medicines. A comparative analysis of data between those HH with at least one member with disability and HH with no member with disability shows that slightly more priority needs were reported by the former group between 86-89, compared to the latter 81. While reported needs in the group with no members with disability were widely spread, the most cited priorities needs for HH with at least a person with disability were healthcare services and medicines. An interesting observation which needs to be further explored is the fact that accommodation and employmentlivelihood was reported as a problem by less HH with disabilities than in those without members with disabilities.",
        "They are often surprised at the very low number of regular schools that integrate children with disability in Slovakia\".8 As the Platform further reported, \"families may not disclose their child's diagnosis in order to facilitate their enrollment in school or their integration in the wider society\". Additional information provided by the study presented important concerns frequently cited by parents regarding lack of disability-adapted early childhood and formal education capacities. In addition, bullying remains an important concern raised by parents of children with disabilities. In general, HH with no person with a disability reported being more aware of protection services mainly state social services, than those with a member with disability.",
        "Only between 6 and 8 of households with a member with disability reported dissatisfaction with the assistance received. The high satisfaction might be related to multi-purpose cash and material need assistance provision available for persons with disabilities, particularly provided by MOLSAF. 11 This refers to any kind of assistance provided by humanitarian actors, government, or other entities. 12 Data provided by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and the Family of SR upon reguest.---In particular, respondents were asked if they encountered any challenges accessing information needed including information on rights and entitlements, access to services.",
        "Persons with disabilities have the same basic needs as other refugees, but often face barriers to receiving the required assistance, or specific attention and targeted interventions. The situation is more challenging for refugee children with disabilities as they have limited access to education, health, child and social protection services. The analysis is presented across sectors, based on the MSNA 2023 collected information, and complemented with information from secondary sources, such as focus groups discussions and previous analysis.",
        "This percentage differs in the case of HH with a person with disability, which represents between 17 and 14. \"Financial support related to disability in Slovakia is a complex and long-term process\"Adult person during a focus group discussion in TrnavaThe comparative analysis shows that HH with a person with disability tend to make less use of financial services, such as a bank account or an account at a formal financial institution in Slovakia. Between 76 and 70 of respondents reported using this kind of services, compared to the 80 of HH without a member with a disability. The degree of serious disability is assessed by social workers of the Ministry following a questionnaire based on WHODAS22.",
        "However, a further in-depth survey would be necessary to understand the hindrances HH with a member with disabilities may be facing in the access to information. This might also indicate isolation and a lower level of inclusion in local communities, which is unfortunately the case in the domestic population as well.In addition, better planning and responses requires official disaggregated data on refugees with disabilities, on needs, barriers, additional cost of living, as well as the available support and type of participation and inclusion opportunities of children, adolescents and persons with disabilities. In this connection, apart of the sectoral information on education and health, it is critical to facilitate evidence-based planning for humanitarian actors and other stakeholders.Many of those priorities are reflected in the UKRAINE SITUATION REGIONAL REFUGEE RESPONSE PLAN 2024 for Slovakia.

Furthermore, health needs can be costly, unpredictable, and thus challenging to be met through recurrent MPC payments.

Sectoral cash and voucher assistance in health shouldn't disrupt regular functioning of the health system but should complement it with a clear phase-out strategy incorporated during the planning process.Ukraine CVA for Health Framework conceptual modelThe Ukraine CVA for Health Framework is informed by the Tanahashi framework, a conceptual model used in public health to assess bottlenecks and improve access to health care services.",

For example, in 2022 additional services such as providing mental health care at the PHC level and providing complex rehabilitation services were included in the PMG.",
        "With regards to the AMP, the program now accepts paper-based prescriptions and allows internally displaced patients to receive medications without obtaining a new prescription or receiving a prescription from a PHC doctor who they do not have a declaration signed with. Recently, the NHSU broadened the AMP to include painkillers for palliative care patients, immunosuppressive drugs and test strips for determining blood glucose levels in type I diabetes.5 In 2024, the AMP will further expand to include additional medicines for the treatment of mental health conditions. To increase access to medicines, mobile pharmacies were launched in rural and frontline communities in Cherkasy, Kharkivska, Mykolaivksa, Kyivska, and Chernihivska regions. In frontline oblasts, health care is impeded by security constraints, transport, and infrastructural challenges.Since the escalation of the war in 2022, the Health Cluster team through the WHO Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care has verified 1,814 attacks on health care in Ukraine as of June 2024, with 143 deaths and 342 injuries to health care workers and patients.",

Positioning Sectoral Cash and Voucher Assistance in HealthSeveral assessment findings have highlighted an increase in household expenditures on health mostly related to the purchase of medicines since the 2022 escalation of the war. This is evidenced by the 2nd round of the Multi-Sector Needs Analysis MSNA, 2023, the WHO Health Needs Assessment HNA 3, and other surveys repeated to gauge population's perceptions on health and barriers to services, including financial ones.The Ukraine humanitarian response has followed up commitments put forth in the Grand Bargain to prioritize cash assistance where possible.

        "The conference aims to generate government aid and private-sector investment for \"recovery, reconstruction, reform, and modernization\" in Ukraine.In the midst of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian authorities have pledged to carry out education reforms intended to keep children learning safely, and also initiated a new strategy to end the harmful, Soviet-era legacy of institutionalizing children deemed to have disabilities or to be from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Human Rights Watch research found the needs are vast and that continued international support may be critical for success. \"A better future for Ukraine means taking the steps needed for every child to realize their potential, and there should be no backsliding in Berlin,\" said Bill Van Esveld, associate children's rights director at Human Rights Watch. \"Getting an education and living in a family rather than an institution are not nice-to-haves, but are a child's fundamental rights, and they deserve full donor support.",

The UN also supplied medical equipment, including emergency health kits, trauma kits, diagnostic tests, and treatments for acute watery diarrhoea, including cholera, sufficient to provide healthcare to nearly 38,000 people for three to six months.Nearly 65,000 emergency repair items and household supplies were distributed to people whose homes had been damaged in the Kherson region. From the earliest days of the disaster, Child Protection organizations reached over 14,000 people, including 7,300 children and over 6,600 caregivers, by deploying multidisciplinary mobile teams to the affected areas, providing mental health and psychosocial support, delivering essential supplies, and ensuring child protection case management and legal assistance.The response continues to ensure people can recover from this human-made catastropheThe UN response extends beyond the emergency phase and continues to support communities in southern Ukraine as they recover from yet another disaster caused by Russia's invasion.",
        "\"Human Rights Watch has documented vast damage and destruction to Ukrainian schools and preschools from attacks, as well as from Russian forces that occupied, pillaged, and trashed schools during the first months of the fighting. However, many parents and children lack the devices and connectivity needed for distance learning, Human Rights Watch found, which moreover may not be accessible for children with disabilities. Ukrainian authorities also require schools to have adequate bomb shelters to resume in-person education.At the Berlin conference, Ukraine's international partners and donors should help the authorities ensure access to quality education for all children, including by restoring damaged educational facilities across Ukraine, in line with safety requirements and strict adherence to accessibility standards mandatory under Ukrainian law. Donor funding should support the development of inclusive rather than segregated education, the groups said.The full-scale invasion also exacerbated the risks to 105,000 children in institutions in Ukraine, including family separation, neglect, and forcible transfer and deportation by Russian and occupation authorities.",
