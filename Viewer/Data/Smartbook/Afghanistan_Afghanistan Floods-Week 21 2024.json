Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen.

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

        "summary": "The recent flash floods in Afghanistan, particularly impacting provinces like Baghlan, Badakhshan, Ghor, Herat, Faryab, and Takhar, caused immediate and widespread devastation [1][2]. Immediately, the floods resulted in over 330 fatalities and hundreds of injuries, with children disproportionately represented among the casualties [1][2]. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed, alongside significant damage to agricultural land, livestock, and critical infrastructure, including roads, schools, and health centers [1][2]. The floods struck populations already facing high levels of food insecurity and economic hardship, pushing communities to the brink of famine, especially in Baghlan [1][3].\n\nIn the long term, these natural disasters have severely exacerbated Afghanistan's existing humanitarian crisis, with a particular impact on children [2]. The widespread destruction of homes and livelihoods has led to displacement and a loss of access to essential services, including health care, clean water, sanitation, and education [2][3]. This critical blow to agriculture and food production further worsens food insecurity for millions already suffering from severe hunger, increasing the risks of malnutrition and waterborne diseases [2][3]. Children, a particularly vulnerable group, are also experiencing trauma, increased displacement, and heightened risks of exploitation following the floods [2]. Humanitarian organizations, including OCHA, UNICEF, and the World Food Programme, are providing crucial assistance, such as food aid, to address the immediate and ongoing needs of the affected populations [1][2][3]."

              "content": "title: Afghanistan: Minutes of FSAC Monthly Meeting (24 April 2024) [Meeting Minutes] \n content: The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) presented a comprehensive overview of early warning information to the cluster partners. Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen.

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

        "summary": "For the FSAC monthly meeting, strategic questions regarding early warning information for floods in Afghanistan could focus on several critical areas. A primary concern is identifying and addressing the significant gaps in existing early warning, preparedness, and response capacities, noting that current systems are often fragmented and lack comprehensive coverage, especially in remote areas [5]. It is crucial to consider how to ensure that early warning systems for floods are community-centric, reliable, accessible, and inclusive, actively involving the most vulnerable populations [3].\n\nAnother key strategic question involves the necessary investments in robust infrastructure, capacity building, and improved data collection and analysis to strengthen these early warning systems [5]. Furthermore, FSAC should discuss how to foster clear communication protocols and enhance multi-stakeholder collaboration to ensure that early warnings effectively translate into anticipatory action for floods [3]. Given the increased frequency and intensity of floods due to climate change, integrating climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) into humanitarian and development planning, informed by early warning information, is a critical strategic consideration [6].\n\nThe meeting could also explore how to improve FSAC's capacity for anticipatory action based on early warning to more effectively mitigate the impacts of floods [6]. Finally, a strategic discussion point should involve how to advocate for sustained funding and donor flexibility to address the humanitarian needs and significant funding gaps for early warning and preparedness initiatives in Afghanistan, amidst ongoing resource limitations [1][4][5]."

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

              "content": "title: Afghanistan: Minutes of FSAC Monthly Meeting (24 April 2024) [Meeting Minutes] \n content: The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) presented a comprehensive overview of early warning information to the cluster partners. Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023.

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces.

              "content": "title: Afghanistan: Minutes of FSAC Monthly Meeting (24 April 2024) [Meeting Minutes] \n content: The Early Warning Information Working Group (EWIWG) presented a comprehensive overview of early warning information to the cluster partners. Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

        "summary": "Improvements implemented in the FSAC monthly meeting can be effective by directly addressing the previous issues of discussions repeating without resolution and disengaged participants [1]. The FSAC plans to enhance meeting effectiveness through a new approach centered on clear objectives and actionable outcomes, ensuring discussions lead to concrete actions and problem resolution [2]. A structured agenda will be crucial for productivity, prioritizing key issues and allocating specific time to cover all critical topics efficiently [3].\n\nEffectiveness will further stem from greater accountability, where each action item will be assigned to a responsible person with a deadline, supported by regular follow-ups to track progress and address any bottlenecks [4]. Encouraging active participant engagement is vital, as creating an open environment where all members can contribute ideas and solutions will boost problem-solving capabilities [5]. Additionally, training for meeting facilitators will improve discussion management, enabling them to guide conversations, prevent digressions, and maintain focus on objectives, thereby leading to more efficient and productive meetings [6]. Collectively, these strategic enhancements aim to transform the monthly meetings into a more impactful forum that successfully addresses and resolves issues [2]."

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

        "summary": "Early warning information in Afghanistan has historically been gathered using diverse methodologies, often necessitated by challenging security environments. Initially, on-the-ground observation, carried out by local staff and community leaders, provided crucial insights, although this information was often fragmented, anecdotal, and potentially biased [1]. Following events such as the Taliban takeover, which reduced on-the-ground presence, there was an increased reliance on local networks, remote monitoring, and satellite imagery [2]. Other employed methodologies included the use of local third-party monitors, digital tools, mobile data collection, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) [3][4][5]. Humanitarian needs assessments were also conducted, although their direct execution became increasingly difficult in insecure environments [4]. Additionally, community-based early warning systems have been utilized to gather localized information [5].\n\nTo enhance the accuracy and timeliness of these data collection methodologies, several improvements are recommended. A critical approach involves better triangulation of data, drawing from diverse sources to overcome the inherent limitations and potential biases of any single method [1][4]. Combining various methodologies, such as integrating remote monitoring with insights from local third-party monitors, can provide more nuanced and reliable data [3]. Investing in local capacity building and fostering local ownership of data collection are crucial steps for improving both accuracy and sustainability [3][5]. Furthermore, ensuring a greater reliance on diverse, real-time data sources, coupled with robust community engagement, is essential for timely early warning [2]. The effective utilization of advanced digital tools, mobile applications, and remote sensing technologies can significantly improve the efficiency and breadth of data collection and analysis [1][5]. Finally, establishing strong data validation processes and feedback mechanisms is vital to verify the reliability of the collected information [5]."

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season. The success of the coming cropping season depends on timely and welldistributed precipitation in the coming months & the availability of irrigation water in the summertime. ➢ Rangeland vegetative conditions during the 2024 spring (March-May) are expected to improve and most likely to be near average in most areas, with some below-average areas due to the persistence of current conditions and above-average temperatures. During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

During summer (JuneSeptember), most areas will turn to below-average, due to below-average cumulative 2023/24 precipitation, above-average temperatures, or both.\n➢ Possible risks: The combination of average to above-average precipitation and above-average temperatures during the remainder of the 2023/24 agricultural season may elevate the risk of yellow rust affecting the yield and productivity of wheat in the eastern, northern, northeastern, and southern provinces. Moreover, concerns exist about the risk of locust infestation in crops and pasture areas. The anticipated near-average to average cumulative precipitation in 2024 will enhance vegetation conditions, which may facilitate the growth of locust populations in the coming months, particularly in the northern and northeastern provinces.\n➢ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A worsen NDVI mainly in northern and eastern and central parts of the country is seen. The land surface Temperature (LST) has reduced significantly in the southern and western. This means that due to the negative LST the vegetation could be impacted.\n➢ Soil Moisture: Currently below average and better than last year but expected to improve given soil moisture and expected precipitation.\n➢ Exchange Rate: After its surge in January 2022, the value of AFN started to consistently appreciate against the USD during the year 2023 and remains relatively stable, hovering around AFN 70-74 per USD since November 2023. The monthly average exchange rate between AFN and USD was recorded at AFN 71.4 per 1 USD during March 2024 and the weekly average rate in third week of April stands at AFN 72.1 per 1USD.",

Here are the key highlights from the presentation.\n➢ Precipitation: rainfall for the 2023/24 winter wet season, from October 2023 to March 2024, is most likely to be below average, with areas with average values. Average precipitation is most likely to occur from March to May 2024, during the wet spring season. Spring rains are expected to have normal timing and distribution, with minimal adverse impact on typical agricultural activities through flooding.\n➢ Temperature: Above average daily mean temperatures are most likely through September 2024. Extreme temperatures during May-July and July-September (upper quintile) are 2-3 times more likely than climatology. The consequences of the above-average temperature may be moisture stress in rainfed crops and rangelands and reduced water availability, mainly in the downstream areas that may experience extended dry spells.\n➢ Snow Water Volumes: Given below-average antecedent precipitation and current snow water volumes, below-average snow water volumes are expected in the coming months. However, there is more snow than in 2023, given recent accumulations due to above-average precipitation in February and March. Above-average temperatures will likely result in an early snow melt through May 2024.\n➢ Wheat planting: Farmers are expected to use the spring window to complete the wheat planting process this season.

        "summary": "Yes, several specific regions and communities require prioritized attention due to significant disparities in infrastructure, services, education, health, economic opportunity, and environmental justice. Rural areas and remote rural settlements are identified as needing infrastructure development, such as roads, bridges, and internet access, as they often lack basic services and face educational disparities like inadequate funding and teacher shortages [1][2]. Similarly, under-resourced urban neighborhoods also require prioritized attention to address educational challenges, including teacher shortages and outdated learning materials [2].\n\nLow-income communities are a key focus for public health interventions due to higher rates of chronic diseases and limited healthcare access, and for environmental justice initiatives as they disproportionately suffer from pollution and climate change impacts [3][5]. Indigenous populations also face significant public health challenges, including limited access to healthcare and environmental hazards [3]. Furthermore, communities of color are highlighted as disproportionately affected by pollution and climate change impacts, necessitating environmental protection and adaptation measures [5]. Within marginalized communities, specific groups such as women, youth, and ethnic minorities require economic empowerment due to barriers in employment, financial services, and entrepreneurship [4]."

        "summary": "The floods have caused widespread devastation with broadly similar impacts across Badakhshan, Baghlan, and Takhar provinces, although the precise scale of human casualties and specific affected locations differ [1][2][3][4][5][6]. All three provinces have endured significant loss of life, injuries, and the extensive destruction of homes, leading to the displacement of numerous families [1][2][3][5]. Crucially, agricultural lands have been severely damaged, and infrastructure such as roads and bridges has been destroyed, hindering access to affected communities and disrupting essential services [3][4][5]. This widespread damage has resulted in the loss of livelihoods, livestock, and has heightened the risk of food insecurity and increased poverty across all affected areas [3][5][6].\n\nSpecifically, Baghlan province has reported the highest number of human casualties, with over 300 individuals killed or injured in districts including Burka, Guzargah-e-Nur, Nahrin, and Baghlani Jadid, where roads to Guzargah-e-Nur and Nahrin were blocked, and power outages occurred [1][2][3][4]. Badakhshan province also experienced a severe toll, with over 200 people killed or injured, particularly in districts such as Registan, Argo, Raghistan, Shuhada, and Yamgan, where the Faizabad-Baharak-Shuhada road was rendered impassable [1][2][3][4]. Takhar province recorded over 140 casualties in areas including Ishkamish, Kalafgan, Farkhar, Taloqan, and Warsaj, with critical routes like the Takhar-Baghlan highway and roads to Farkhar and Warsaj districts becoming blocked [1][2][3][4]. Despite these variations in specific district impacts and casualty numbers, each province has seen more than 2,000 families affected, underscoring a universal and urgent need for humanitarian aid, including food, shelter, non-food items, and medical assistance, as initial assessments continue [1][2][4][5]."

        "summary": "Community resilience in the northeastern region of Afghanistan can be significantly strengthened through a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to better cope with future flooding events [1][2]. A critical element is the establishment of timely and effective early warning systems (EWS), which communicate impending risks clearly to local populations and can be enhanced by integrating indigenous knowledge for improved detection and dissemination [1][3][5]. Investment in resilient physical infrastructure is also essential, including flood protection dams, check dams, river embankments, and the development of flood-resistant housing to mitigate direct impacts and protect assets [1][2][4].\n\nEmpowering local communities through active participation in disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies is vital, by integrating traditional knowledge with modern scientific methods to enhance preparedness and response efforts [1][2][5]. This involves developing community awareness campaigns and providing education on preparedness measures, safe practices, and clear evacuation routes [1][3]. Implementing sustainable land and water management practices, alongside efforts to diversify livelihoods, can further reduce vulnerability to flood impacts and support long-term recovery [2][5]. Moreover, strong coordination among local authorities, non-governmental organizations, and community groups is crucial for effective resource allocation and emergency response [1][3]. By adopting these integrated strategies, communities can enhance their capacity to withstand and recover from future flooding in the region [1][2]."

        "summary": "To enhance timely and effective disaster response and recovery support, local, national, and international agencies must prioritize robust coordination strategies that address systemic challenges [1][2]. Establishing clear communication channels and platforms for seamless information sharing is paramount, as this creates a common operating picture that is often lacking and leads to delays and duplication of efforts [1][2]. Joint planning, regular exercises, and a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities among all levels of agencies are crucial to overcome challenges posed by differing mandates, political interference, and bureaucratic hurdles [1][2].\n\nIntegrating advanced technologies significantly enhances this coordination by providing shared operational frameworks and improving situational awareness [3]. Utilizing data analytics, artificial intelligence, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), satellite imagery, and social media monitoring can drastically improve early warning capabilities, resource allocation, and communication across all response levels [3]. These technological solutions require interoperable systems and shared platforms to ensure all agencies can access and contribute to critical real-time information [3].\n\nFurthermore, effective coordination extends to empowering local communities and integrating their knowledge into broader response frameworks [4]. Building capacity at the local level and ensuring direct community participation leads to more sustainable and effective recovery efforts, linking grassroots initiatives with national and international support [4]. Finally, robust financial coordination is essential, requiring pre-arranged financing mechanisms, risk-pooling, and transparent donor coordination to ensure rapid and accountable fund allocation, thereby addressing critical bottlenecks often exacerbated by inadequate funding [2][5]. By collectively strengthening these multifaceted aspects—communication, planning, technology, local engagement, and finance—agencies can significantly improve their collective capacity for timely and effective disaster response and recovery [1][2][3][4][5]."

        "summary": "The flooding across 21 districts in northeastern Afghanistan has severely impacted critical infrastructure, affecting over 330,000 people [1][3][4][5][6]. Roads and bridges have sustained extensive damage throughout the region [2][4][5][6][7][8]. This destruction of vital transportation infrastructure has significantly hampered access for aid agencies, consequently delaying the delivery of humanitarian assistance [6][7]. Healthcare facilities have also suffered damage or destruction across the affected districts [3][4][6][8], further complicating the provision of essential health services [3][6]. The widespread damage to critical infrastructure poses significant challenges for long-term recovery and resilience-building efforts in these areas [8]. For future disaster preparedness and response, the repeated nature of these floods underscores the urgent need for robust disaster risk reduction strategies and resilient infrastructure development [10]. This necessitates crucial investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and early warning systems to mitigate the impact of future events [9]."

So far, 8,696 houses have been reported destroyed or damaged in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces. International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities. Through these concerted efforts, International Medical Corps will help alleviate the floods' immediate impacts and support the region's long-term recovery.\n\nInternational Medical Corps staff distribute tents to families affected by the floods in Baghlan province.\n\nInternational Medical Corps female staff assist with distribution of dignity kits to families affected by floods in Baghlan province.",

              "content": "title: SITUATION UPDATE \n content: SITUATION UPDATE\n\nAfghanistan Humanitarian Update—May Floods Situation Report #2 May 21, 2024\n\nInternational Medical Corps staff distribute hygiene kits to eligible families affected by the floods in Baghlan province.\n\nThe situation in Baghlan province remains dire due to the recent flooding there, with tens of thousands of people affected and forced to live in open areas. So far, 8,696 houses have been reported destroyed or damaged in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces. International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities. Through these concerted efforts, International Medical Corps will help alleviate the floods' immediate impacts and support the region's long-term recovery.\n\nInternational Medical Corps staff distribute tents to families affected by the floods in Baghlan province.\n\nInternational Medical Corps female staff assist with distribution of dignity kits to families affected by floods in Baghlan province.",

The number of casualties is expected to rise significantly as the full extent of the damage is not yet determined and most people are living unsheltered on open ground. Several health facilities have been affected and reported as non-operational. Meanwhile, increased cases of waterborne illnesses—such as diarrhea and skin infections—have been reported in areas affected by flooding.",

So far, 8,696 houses have been reported destroyed or damaged in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces. International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities.

        "summary": "The heavy rainfall in May 2018 resulted from an unusual combination of meteorological factors [2]. A key contributing element was the unusual persistence of a blocking high-pressure system situated over Scandinavia and northern Europe throughout the month [2][3][4]. This blocking system prevented typical westerly flows and diverted Atlantic low-pressure systems, along with their associated rainfall, southwards [3]. Concurrently, a slow-moving low-pressure system lingered over the Atlantic, creating a significant pressure gradient that drew in substantial moisture [2][3]. The North Atlantic Ocean also exhibited very high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during May 2018, which significantly enhanced evaporation and provided an abundant moisture source for the rainfall [1][4]. Additionally, a shift in the jet stream contributed to these atmospheric conditions [2]. This specific interplay of atmospheric blocking and enhanced moisture from the warm North Atlantic was the primary cause of the record rainfall experienced [4].\n\nThese meteorological insights can significantly inform future predictions and preparedness for extreme weather events. Understanding how rapid warming in sea surface temperatures, as observed in May 2018, can potentially lead to more extreme events is crucial for future forecasting [1]. Furthermore, the persistence of blocking high-pressure systems and their interaction with warm ocean temperatures provides valuable insights for predicting future extreme rainfall events [3][4]. Climate change is also projected to increase the frequency of such extreme rainfall events, making these observations vital for long-term planning [4]. Therefore, monitoring shifts in the jet stream and the development of unusual pressure gradients will be key for future weather predictions [2]."

So far, 8,696 houses have been reported destroyed or damaged in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces. International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities. Through these concerted efforts, International Medical Corps will help alleviate the floods' immediate impacts and support the region's long-term recovery.\n\nInternational Medical Corps staff distribute tents to families affected by the floods in Baghlan province.\n\nInternational Medical Corps female staff assist with distribution of dignity kits to families affected by floods in Baghlan province.",

International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities. Through these concerted efforts, International Medical Corps will help alleviate the floods' immediate impacts and support the region's long-term recovery.\n\nInternational Medical Corps staff distribute tents to families affected by the floods in Baghlan province.\n\nInternational Medical Corps female staff assist with distribution of dignity kits to families affected by floods in Baghlan province.",

        "summary": "The flooding in Afghanistan has disproportionately affected vulnerable populations, especially women and children, with children under 18 years old comprising 80% of those impacted [1]. This demographic faces heightened risks of waterborne diseases, malnutrition, and displacement, and many children have been among the 150 fatalities across provinces like Baghlan, Badakhshan, Ghor, and Herat [1][2]. Women, including over 13,000 pregnant and lactating women in Badakhshan alone, encounter significant barriers to accessing aid due to social norms and distance, and face an increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV) [1][2]. The destruction of homes, schools, and health facilities further exacerbates these vulnerabilities, leading to long-term impacts on children's education, mental health, and overall well-being, while also increasing their risk of exploitation and child labor [1][2]. Women-headed households are particularly at risk, and the loss of livelihoods directly compromises children's futures [1].\n\nAddressing the devastating impact of the flooding requires a combination of immediate humanitarian assistance and long-term, resilience-building interventions [1][2][3]. Immediate responses should include providing essential food, clean water, shelter, and medical aid to affected families [2][3]. UNICEF and its partners are implementing multi-sectoral responses, which involve delivering safe drinking water, hygiene kits, and sanitation facilities through WASH services [1]. Health interventions focus on deploying mobile health teams, providing essential medicines, conducting nutrition screenings, and treating malnutrition, especially for pregnant and lactating women [1]. Child protection services offer psychosocial support, family tracing, and measures to prevent exploitation, while education interventions provide temporary learning spaces and \"school-in-a-box\" kits [1]. Furthermore, interventions must advocate for gender-responsive aid and protection against GBV, alongside providing cash assistance to vulnerable households [1]. For long-term resilience, specific interventions include investing in early warning systems, developing resilient infrastructure, and implementing community-based disaster risk reduction strategies [2][3]. It is also crucial to support the agriculture sector to prevent food insecurity, address underlying causes of vulnerability, and foster livelihoods and economic recovery [2][3]. Sustained support from the international community is essential for both immediate relief efforts and building long-term resilience against future climatic shocks [2][3]."

So far, 8,696 houses have been reported destroyed or damaged in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces. International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities.

So far, 8,696 houses have been reported destroyed or damaged in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces. International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities. Through these concerted efforts, International Medical Corps will help alleviate the floods' immediate impacts and support the region's long-term recovery.\n\nInternational Medical Corps staff distribute tents to families affected by the floods in Baghlan province.\n\nInternational Medical Corps female staff assist with distribution of dignity kits to families affected by floods in Baghlan province.",

        "summary": "The May 2018 flooding caused a significant economic impact, leading to millions of dollars in damages and creating long-term financial strain for affected businesses and residents [1][3]. The agricultural sector suffered immense losses from widespread crop damage and livestock displacement, resulting in financial hardship for farmers and threatening food supply chains [1][3]. Small businesses faced closures and revenue declines due to disrupted supply chains and reduced consumer spending [3]. Tourism, a key economic driver, experienced a significant plummet in bookings [1][3]. Infrastructure damage, including roads and bridges, created logistical nightmares, hindered economic activity, and necessitated sustained investment for long-term recovery efforts [1][3][4].\n\nThe estimated damages exceeded $50 million, requiring the government to allocate emergency funds which impacted budget priorities [3][5]. Beyond the local area, state and national economies experienced ripple effects, as the disruption of supply chains for agricultural products and manufactured goods led to price increases and shortages in other regions [5]. Furthermore, there was an increased demand for construction materials and labor for rebuilding efforts [5]. The insurance industry faced a surge in claims, affecting its profitability, and overall GDP growth was temporarily impacted [5]."

We also are preparing to offer emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs), supplies to meet the immediate needs identified in the assessments.\nSITUATION UPDATE\nFollowing significant rainfall on May 10–11, devastating floods struck Baghlan province in Afghanistan, affecting Baghlan Markazi, Burka and Nahrin districts, and Pulikhumri city. An initial Flood Need Assessment and Response Tracking Matrix, created collaboratively by International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration, the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners, revealed that the flooding killed more than 300 people, injured more than 100, and damaged or destroyed about 2,000 houses.\nAs need assessment efforts continue, hundreds have been reported to be trapped in their homes beneath mud, with rescue operations ongoing. The number of casualties is expected to rise significantly as the full extent of the damage is not yet determined and most people are living unsheltered on open ground. Several health facilities have been affected and reported as non-operational. Meanwhile, increased cases of waterborne illnesses—such as diarrhea and skin infections—have been reported in areas affected by flooding.",

So far, 8,696 houses have been reported destroyed or damaged in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces. International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities. Through these concerted efforts, International Medical Corps will help alleviate the floods' immediate impacts and support the region's long-term recovery.\n\nInternational Medical Corps staff distribute tents to families affected by the floods in Baghlan province.\n\nInternational Medical Corps female staff assist with distribution of dignity kits to families affected by floods in Baghlan province.",

So far, 8,696 houses have been reported destroyed or damaged in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces. International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi. The emergency response team distributed tents to 24 flood-affected families living in remote locations of (Desalah and Tala Wa Barfak) in the Doshi and Nahrin districts through joint distribution with the IOM, ANDMA and other humanitarian partners.\n\nThe emergency response team of International Medical Corps conducted a one-day training on psychological first aid for 54 community health workers (31 females, and 23 males) in gender-specific groups.\n---\nBurka district is one of the most remote locations in Baghlan province, where humanitarian assistance is hard to provide to affected families. International Medical Corps will be deploying two female medical doctors to the district to provide medical support in response to the increased number of sicknesses in the flood-affected areas of the district.\n\nThe International Medical Corps will continue to share updates and work within the framework established during OCT meetings to provide comprehensive support to the affected communities.

        "summary": "Addressing the increasing frequency and intensity of flooding events in Afghanistan requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing preventative measures, infrastructure development, and long-term adaptation strategies [2][7][8]. A crucial step is the establishment and strengthening of robust early warning systems to protect vulnerable communities and enable timely responses to impending disasters [1][2][9]. Alongside this, significant investment in flood protection infrastructure, such as dams and embankments, is essential to build resilience and safeguard homes, agricultural land, and critical infrastructure from devastation [2][7][9].\n\nFurthermore, long-term strategies must prioritize disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate adaptation, implementing community-based solutions to enhance local resilience against future climatic shocks [2][3][4][8]. While immediate humanitarian aid, including food, water, and shelter, is vital for communities impacted by floods, these preventative and adaptive measures are key to reducing the overall scale of humanitarian crises [1][5][6]. However, the implementation of these critical measures is complicated by challenges such as international sanctions, the lack of recognition for the de facto authorities, and difficulties in securing adequate funding and facilitating aid delivery [3][9]. Therefore, a comprehensive strategy integrating resilient infrastructure, effective early warning, climate adaptation, and community engagement, despite governance complexities, is paramount to mitigate Afghanistan's escalating flood crisis [1][2][3][8][9]."

International Medical Corps, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) and other humanitarian partners continue to perform needs assessments. Given that the impact of the disaster is vast, there is a likelihood that the numbers mentioned above may increase.\n\nAs needs assessments continue, certain areas such as Guzaragh Noor and Tala o Barafak remain inaccessible by road, due to the damage caused by flooding. As the only viable transportation to the mentioned areas is by air, a joint assessment team was deployed by helicopter to Burka district. The Jelga district of the province has just become accessible. However, more rainfall has been predicted in the coming days. Cases of acute respiratory infection with pneumonia, as well as acute watery diarrhea with dehydration, have been reported in flood-affected areas.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nHeavy rainfall on May 10–18 caused flooding in Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar provinces that destroyed or damaged about 8,700 houses and affected 60,672 people, according to assessments carried out by the Health Cluster, OCHA and the WHO.\n\nOUR FOOTPRINT\n\nInternational Medical Corps has been operating in Afghanistan since 1984, providing primary and secondary healthcare, training, health education, emergency response, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), nutrition services, protection services, community empowerment, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nInternational Medical Corps is continuing joint assessments with humanitarian partners. Our response has included emergency shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and supplies to meet immediate needs identified in the assessments.\n\nInternational Medical Corps Response\n\nIn addition to assessing areas in Baghlan, the emergency response team of International Medical Corps has participated in meetings held by the Operational Coordination Team (OCT), the Provincial Public Health Directorate, the Provincial Disaster Management Committee and the Directorate of Economy, focusing on coordinating joint assessment efforts and response.\n\nInternational Medical Corps has distributed hygiene kits to 100 eligible families in the Baghlan Markazi district, and 159 dignity kits to affected families in Baghlan Markazi and Godam Hai Talashi.

        "summary": "The May 2018 flooding in Afghanistan, particularly in Baghlan province, underscored critical lessons for enhancing future natural disaster preparedness and response [2][6]. A key lesson learned is the urgent need for improved disaster preparedness and robust early warning systems to mitigate the devastating impact on communities and infrastructure [2][5][6]. The lack of preparedness for severe disasters often leads to a heavy reliance on humanitarian aid, highlighting the necessity for Afghanistan to develop stronger internal capacities [3].\n\nFuture improvements should prioritize community-based disaster risk reduction (CBDRR) approaches, ensuring local ownership and integrating these strategies into broader development plans [3]. Strengthening national and sub-national disaster risk management (DRM) institutions is also essential for effective coordination and response [1]. The floods demonstrated the need for multi-sectoral interventions that extend beyond immediate relief to encompass long-term recovery and resilience-building efforts [5]. Integrating climate change adaptation into disaster management frameworks is crucial, promoting climate-adaptive measures and pre-disaster early action to address increasing risks [1][5]. Moreover, the challenges in accessing affected areas due to damaged infrastructure during the 2018 response emphasized the need for resilient infrastructure and improved logistical planning for humanitarian assistance [4]."
