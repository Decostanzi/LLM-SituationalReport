Key response activities include: 1) providing of wellbeing and educational support in safe spaces for children who have been displaced or evacuated. 2) access to online learning for children in Donetska oblast amid intensified missile attacks and damage to educational infrastructure; 3) access to offline learning and wellbeing activities for both displaced and host community children if the security situation allows to enable these children to stay engaged with formal schooling and mitigate the potential learning losses resulting from the disruption to their education; 4) support for teachers who might be themselves affected by escalations (displaced) and face increased workload and challenges in supporting their students.\n\nLatest context notice! As of 23 May 2024, The Head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration and the Head of the Regional Military Administration, Vadym Filashkin, announced that due to the worsening security situation in the region, the operation of educational consultation points for schoolchildren is temporarily suspended. Any gathering of people, especially children, could pose a threat to their lives. As of 29 May 2024, the regional commission on technogenic and environmental safety and emergencies in Donetska oblast has decided to evacuate families with children from Lyman, the villages of Lypove, Nove, Karpivka, Stavky of the Lymanska hromada, the village of Prohres of the Hrodivska hromada, and the settlement of Zoria of the Illinivska hromada. The decision must be coordinated with the Coordination Headquarters for the mandatory evacuation of the population under martial law conditions. The heads of the military administrations have been tasked with pre-determining evacuation routes and the availability of transit hubs. It was also noted that there is a need for the health and recreation of children who have been traumatized by the war and need psychological assistance and rest.\n\nActivities: Provision of MHPSS (including social-emotional learning and informal education support) Distribution of learning kits and electronic devices for learning; Establishment of safe spaces for children to play, and receive wellbeing and learning support ( (Temporary Learning Spaces/Digital Learning Centers) ; Catch up learning support services for children to regain access to formal learning; Wellbeing support services for teachers.\n---\nModality of assistance\n\ntargeted educational support for children in collective cites (in coordination with CCCM cluster); educational support for IDP children in receiving hromadas of Donetska and Dnipropetrovska oblasts (esp. Dobropillia, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk) both offline and online; online educational and wellbeing support to affected children where security situation prevents offline learning services.\n\nConsidering the security situation in Donetska oblast, we recommend the partners working or planning to work in Donetska oblast switch to an online format or use mobile brigades in those areas where offline mode activities can put beneficiaries at risk. In other areas, the security situation should be taken into consideration and regular consultations with the authorities should be conducted. All activities should be held only in safe places, and if the security situation allows.\n\nOrganizations active in the affected areas/with capacity to scale-up\n\nMembers:\n\nActive members: UNICEF, Save the Children, Posmishka UA, We are brothers, We Are Ukrainians, Fishing Club Ukraine, Angels of Salvation, Association of Preschool Education Workers, Osvitoria, Wanted here, Teach for Ukraine, Variant",

Despite ongoing shelling, schools continue to educate children online, providing access to online learning platforms and ensuring teacher training for remote instruction [1]. Psychological and psychosocial services have been integrated into the educational framework to address trauma and stress among students and teachers, with efforts also being made to prepare for the safe return to in-person learning when conditions allow [1]. Furthermore, over 3,000 children from Kharkiv have been evacuated to safer regions to prevent harm from constant shelling and provide a more stable environment, where they are ensured access to education and psychological support in their new locations [2]. UNICEF is also actively supporting the educational infrastructure in Kharkivska oblast by distributing educational supplies, establishing digital learning centers, and providing technical assistance for online learning [3]. These UNICEF programs additionally extend to providing mental health and psychosocial support services to children and caregivers, crucial for safeguarding children's mental wellbeing amidst instability [3]."

To preserve the lives of the population located in a 5-10 kilometer zone from the border f it is recommended that people be evacuated to safe, prepared places in accordance with the evacuation plans of the hromadas of Sumy, Okhtyrka, Konotop, and Shostka rayons or other oblasts. Voluntary early evacuation of the population from Bilopillia and Vorozhba is also underway. The local authorities are concerned about the growing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the event of a security situation deteriorating within a 20-30 km zone. With only 11 Collective Centers (CCs) in Sumy, there is insufficient accommodation for potential IDPs.

        "summary": "Yes, there are several specific programs and interventions in place to support mental health and emotional resilience, often involving a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach [5]. These include the implementation of social-emotional learning (SEL) programs and curricula designed to teach vital skills such as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making [4]. A multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) or a similar framework is often utilized, encompassing universal prevention, targeted support, and individualized care, alongside peer support programs to foster connection and mutual aid [3]. Schools commit to a 'whole-school approach,' integrating mental health support into the curriculum, providing professional development for staff, and promoting positive relationships and a supportive environment [2][5]. Trained professionals, such as school counselors and psychologists, along with empathetic teachers, are readily available for early intervention, support, and to provide resources [1][2]. Furthermore, these initiatives aim to promote mental health awareness, provide educational materials and workshops, and actively work to reduce stigma, fostering a culture of openness [1][3]. Collaboration with families, external agencies, healthcare providers, and community organizations is also a crucial aspect of these interventions to ensure accessible and holistic care [2][5]."

Key response activities include: 1) providing of wellbeing and educational support in safe spaces for children who have been displaced or evacuated. 2) access to online learning for children in Donetska oblast amid intensified missile attacks and damage to educational infrastructure; 3) access to offline learning and wellbeing activities for both displaced and host community children if the security situation allows to enable these children to stay engaged with formal schooling and mitigate the potential learning losses resulting from the disruption to their education; 4) support for teachers who might be themselves affected by escalations (displaced) and face increased workload and challenges in supporting their students.\n\nLatest context notice! As of 23 May 2024, The Head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration and the Head of the Regional Military Administration, Vadym Filashkin, announced that due to the worsening security situation in the region, the operation of educational consultation points for schoolchildren is temporarily suspended. Any gathering of people, especially children, could pose a threat to their lives. As of 29 May 2024, the regional commission on technogenic and environmental safety and emergencies in Donetska oblast has decided to evacuate families with children from Lyman, the villages of Lypove, Nove, Karpivka, Stavky of the Lymanska hromada, the village of Prohres of the Hrodivska hromada, and the settlement of Zoria of the Illinivska hromada. The decision must be coordinated with the Coordination Headquarters for the mandatory evacuation of the population under martial law conditions. The heads of the military administrations have been tasked with pre-determining evacuation routes and the availability of transit hubs. It was also noted that there is a need for the health and recreation of children who have been traumatized by the war and need psychological assistance and rest.\n\nActivities: Provision of MHPSS (including social-emotional learning and informal education support) Distribution of learning kits and electronic devices for learning; Establishment of safe spaces for children to play, and receive wellbeing and learning support ( (Temporary Learning Spaces/Digital Learning Centers) ; Catch up learning support services for children to regain access to formal learning; Wellbeing support services for teachers.\n---\nModality of assistance\n\ntargeted educational support for children in collective cites (in coordination with CCCM cluster); educational support for IDP children in receiving hromadas of Donetska and Dnipropetrovska oblasts (esp. Dobropillia, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk) both offline and online; online educational and wellbeing support to affected children where security situation prevents offline learning services.\n\nConsidering the security situation in Donetska oblast, we recommend the partners working or planning to work in Donetska oblast switch to an online format or use mobile brigades in those areas where offline mode activities can put beneficiaries at risk. In other areas, the security situation should be taken into consideration and regular consultations with the authorities should be conducted. All activities should be held only in safe places, and if the security situation allows.\n\nOrganizations active in the affected areas/with capacity to scale-up\n\nMembers:\n\nActive members: UNICEF, Save the Children, Posmishka UA, We are brothers, We Are Ukrainians, Fishing Club Ukraine, Angels of Salvation, Association of Preschool Education Workers, Osvitoria, Wanted here, Teach for Ukraine, Variant",

        "summary": "The education system plays a multifaceted and crucial role in supporting the wellbeing of children during periods of disruption, extending beyond academic learning to encompass mental, emotional, social, and physical health [1][3][5]. Schools serve as primary providers of mental health support, offering crucial services to address the surge in anxiety and stress experienced by children during crises, often reaching those who might not otherwise receive help [2][4][6]. They are vital in providing continuity, predictable routines, and a sense of normalcy, which are essential for children's emotional regulation, stability, and resilience amidst uncertainty [1][3][5][6]. Furthermore, schools function as safe and structured environments, protecting children from the negative impacts of disruption, including identifying potential signs of abuse or neglect and offering a secure space away from chaotic home environments [1][3][5]. Beyond protection, the education system ensures access to essential resources such as nutritious meals and healthcare services, particularly for vulnerable populations whose access might be compromised during disruptions [1][3][5]. Schools also foster social interaction and provide consistent support from trusted adults and peers, which are critical for children's social and emotional development and help mitigate feelings of isolation [1][5][6]. By maintaining academic continuity and addressing learning loss, the education system indirectly supports wellbeing by reducing stress related to educational gaps and actively works to mitigate widening disparities exacerbated by disruptions [1][4]."

To preserve the lives of the population located in a 5-10 kilometer zone from the border f it is recommended that people be evacuated to safe, prepared places in accordance with the evacuation plans of the hromadas of Sumy, Okhtyrka, Konotop, and Shostka rayons or other oblasts. Voluntary early evacuation of the population from Bilopillia and Vorozhba is also underway. The local authorities are concerned about the growing number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the event of a security situation deteriorating within a 20-30 km zone. With only 11 Collective Centers (CCs) in Sumy, there is insufficient accommodation for potential IDPs.

        "summary": "Local educational institutions are implementing multi-faceted strategies, often in collaboration with various organizations, to ensure continuity of learning for children displaced by conflict [1][2][4]. To accommodate increased student enrollment in schools near conflict zones, adaptations include establishing temporary learning spaces, utilizing community centers, and setting up additional classrooms within existing school structures [1][2]. Digital learning platforms and distance education have become key strategies, involving the distribution of tablets and the provision of internet access, especially in areas where physical access to schools is challenging [3].\n\nFurthermore, institutions are focused on supporting educators by providing teacher training, particularly in trauma-informed care, and recruiting volunteer teachers to address shortages and meet the unique needs of displaced children [2][4]. Educational content is being adapted to local contexts, and language support is provided for diverse groups, alongside catch-up classes to facilitate integration into the formal education system [3][4]. Community-based organizations (CBOs) and local NGOs, working with municipalities, are also playing a crucial role by establishing these learning spaces and addressing essential psychosocial support and basic needs, which are vital for a conducive learning environment [1]. Local governments and educational authorities are coordinating these efforts by allocating emergency funds and partnering with international aid organizations for resources and expertise [4]. Despite these extensive adaptations, institutions continue to face significant challenges such as limited resources and teacher shortages [2]."

Key response activities include: 1) providing of wellbeing and educational support in safe spaces for children who have been displaced or evacuated. 2) access to online learning for children in Donetska oblast amid intensified missile attacks and damage to educational infrastructure; 3) access to offline learning and wellbeing activities for both displaced and host community children if the security situation allows to enable these children to stay engaged with formal schooling and mitigate the potential learning losses resulting from the disruption to their education; 4) support for teachers who might be themselves affected by escalations (displaced) and face increased workload and challenges in supporting their students.\n\nLatest context notice! As of 23 May 2024, The Head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration and the Head of the Regional Military Administration, Vadym Filashkin, announced that due to the worsening security situation in the region, the operation of educational consultation points for schoolchildren is temporarily suspended. Any gathering of people, especially children, could pose a threat to their lives. As of 29 May 2024, the regional commission on technogenic and environmental safety and emergencies in Donetska oblast has decided to evacuate families with children from Lyman, the villages of Lypove, Nove, Karpivka, Stavky of the Lymanska hromada, the village of Prohres of the Hrodivska hromada, and the settlement of Zoria of the Illinivska hromada. The decision must be coordinated with the Coordination Headquarters for the mandatory evacuation of the population under martial law conditions. The heads of the military administrations have been tasked with pre-determining evacuation routes and the availability of transit hubs. It was also noted that there is a need for the health and recreation of children who have been traumatized by the war and need psychological assistance and rest.\n\nActivities: Provision of MHPSS (including social-emotional learning and informal education support) Distribution of learning kits and electronic devices for learning; Establishment of safe spaces for children to play, and receive wellbeing and learning support ( (Temporary Learning Spaces/Digital Learning Centers) ; Catch up learning support services for children to regain access to formal learning; Wellbeing support services for teachers.\n---\nModality of assistance\n\ntargeted educational support for children in collective cites (in coordination with CCCM cluster); educational support for IDP children in receiving hromadas of Donetska and Dnipropetrovska oblasts (esp. Dobropillia, Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk) both offline and online; online educational and wellbeing support to affected children where security situation prevents offline learning services.\n\nConsidering the security situation in Donetska oblast, we recommend the partners working or planning to work in Donetska oblast switch to an online format or use mobile brigades in those areas where offline mode activities can put beneficiaries at risk. In other areas, the security situation should be taken into consideration and regular consultations with the authorities should be conducted. All activities should be held only in safe places, and if the security situation allows.\n\nOrganizations active in the affected areas/with capacity to scale-up\n\nMembers:\n\nActive members: UNICEF, Save the Children, Posmishka UA, We are brothers, We Are Ukrainians, Fishing Club Ukraine, Angels of Salvation, Association of Preschool Education Workers, Osvitoria, Wanted here, Teach for Ukraine, Variant",

        "summary": "Teachers in Kharkivska oblast are receiving crucial training and support to navigate the unique challenges of educating children impacted by war [5][6]. A significant initiative by the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) and UNICEF aims to train 100,000 teachers and school psychologists in psychosocial support (MHPSS) skills and stress resistance [2][6]. This training is specifically designed to equip educators to support children's well-being, identify mental health needs, and provide first psychological aid to those affected by war, displacement, and loss, which is particularly vital given children's exposure to violence [1][2][6]. The \"Safe Digital Education\" program, directly targeting Kharkivska oblast among other regions, encompasses training in both psychosocial support and digital skills [6]. Furthermore, teachers are being supported to adapt to the prevalent online learning environment through initiatives like \"Digital Together\" [3][4]. This support includes providing 50,000 laptops to teachers and training 150,000 educators in digital literacy, safe internet usage, and cybersecurity [3][5]. The expansion of the \"Digital Together\" project is specifically focused on improving digital education infrastructure and providing devices for teachers and students in Kharkivska, Zaporizka, and Sumska oblasts [5]. These comprehensive programs aim to ensure teachers can create a safe, supportive, and effective learning environment despite the ongoing challenges of war, including limited access to devices, internet, and electricity [2][4]."
